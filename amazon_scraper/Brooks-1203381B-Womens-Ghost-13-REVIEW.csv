I bought some Brooks last year for work and they did great, really made a difference, so I invested in a new pair when I started working again after the shutdown. They are as great as the previous pair—comfy and well-made. I do put orthopedic inserts in, because no shoe can singlehandedly solve the problems of my feet, and I know that also makes a difference, but it would not work with another pair of shoes I don't think.

I don’t know if I’m just not used to having a shoe hug my foot the way these do but they feel a little snug. Not enough for me to return them. As far as comfort goes, at this price point I was expecting to feel like I was walking on clouds. I expected them to be super cushiony, but they aren’t. They feel kind of hard inside, if you know what I mean. This is my first pair of Brooks, I usually run in adidas.  Probably my last pair, because even though they’re beautiful and look snazzy, the comfort just isn’t there for a  $130 shoe.

I've tried many sneakers from Altra, Mizuno, Ryka to compare against this Brooks brand and they have won with flying colors!!!!There aren't any better sneakers with as much arch support as these Brooks Ghost 13 sneakers have! You literally feel like you are bouncing when you walk without feeling like you're seeping into your shoe with every step. When you put on these sneakers it makes you want to work out (which is a plus for someone who dislikes exercise). It provides so much support for your calves and knees, which is a MUST for me.The outsole is actually wide enough for my normal width feet. It is not too narrow or too wide, like how some Men sizes can be. It has a full rubber sole so you have the traction you need even for wet rainy days. This is an all-season sneaker with enough support for all seasons without being too hot or cold. The design is very sleek and would look nice even on casual days out.I would definitely size up (at least a half size, although I did a full size) in any sneakers from the Brooks brand. I've tried three different style sneakers (Transmit 2, the Launch 5, and the Ghost 13) and I had to size up for all of them. Since there is so much support and cushion, I would allow a little extra wiggle room for larger feet.These are literally my favorite sneakers now and I'm glad I took the plunge (I never pay this much for sneakers LOL). I would highly recommend these sneakers from Brooks in the Ghost 13. For these other sneaker styles, the Launch 5 would be 2nd but nothing beats these Ghost 13. I encourage you to try these if you've tried all the other brands that haven't worked out thus far. In the past, I've tried all the popular brands including Nike and nothing compares to these (No, I'm not getting paid to say this LOL). I hope this review helps :)",The BEST of the BEST....

So I deduced that they had to have been just a tad small since my big toe on the one foot was especially in pain. You know how they say one foot is slightly larger than the other.I considered exchanging for a half size larger, but after that kind of pain I decided I didn't want to take any chances. I may try the Glycerin 18 (once I've recovered from the foot pain). In the meantime I found my beloved Glycerin 17 on ebay for $40.
