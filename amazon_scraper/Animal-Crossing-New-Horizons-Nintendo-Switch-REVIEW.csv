As a lady that enjoys playing video games with my husband I honestly expected to be able to play full multiplayer in this game. This game does not allow full 2 player capabilities as the 2nd play is very neutered in what they can do. There is far too much controller shaking involved in trying to be able to do anything in order to give the other person a chance at playing with all items and access to the bag and shop. We both wanted to have a full two player co-op experience and you just don't get that with this game at all. It's the biggest let down game moment for us since Splatoon 2 was online co-op or multi-switch co-op only. While I'll still play my game and enjoy it I would absolutely love the game if it had a full multiplayer setup.

So everyone using the same system is forced to inhabit the same island. This causes there to be nothing for anyone else to do after one person has played the game for the day. Huge bummer. Was looking forward to playing this with my fiancé but really not fun for me to wonder around a city with everything done for me already.Only way to right this would be for me to buy a second console($200-$300) and another copy of this game($60).

I loved animal crossing wild world, and was hoping to get into more animal crossing with new horizon. I wanted to share this game with my girlfriend on our one switch that we share. Unfortunately the game limits you to one island per console, and this comes with some bad limits. I started the island, but since i have less time to game than my girlfriend, she ran into some hard limits early on, and cant progress in the island until i can push the story further. We ended up deleting that island so she can create her own. This will limit me and i dont feel any incentive to play it right now. I get nintendo wants to get people to buy more switches, but this is a ridiculus attempt at it. If you want to share this game with anyone on the same console, dont buy it.

I'm not sure where to begin. There is really a lot to say about the long awaited addition to the Animal Crossing family and to be fair, some of it is positive. To be honest, plenty of the criticism is deserved as well.As a mother of four kids and a fan of the game myself (yep, I played it on the wii and fell in love. The ONLY video game I've ever truly been a fan of- what can I say? It helps me de-stress!), I'm not going to pull any punches when I say that the one island per Switch thing is ridiculous and could in fact damage future development and/or releases. This is a deal breaker for a lot of families. We went ahead and bought the game knowing this was an issue but were hoping to give it a try. After all, we shared City Folk just fine. But one of the main issues is that the person who starts the game sort of gets everything and takes over the development of the island while the other players are just kind of left in the dust for a while. Sure, they still gain points, manage their homes, get DIY plans, but everything they do comes slower, fewer, and is held up by the first player. They're not really creating their own story- they're following in the shadows of the story the first player started. I say that as the first player of our game and it stinks. I would have loved to have passed on some of the challenges and rewards to my kids to complete but instead I just felt rushed to get as much done as possible so they could progress as well.Another interesting tidbit- and many won't care about this but conservative parents might so I'm mentioning it for them- are the few LGBT references in the American or English version of the game. The Japanese version strangely doesn't contain these references but they were included in the English version and this is notable to me. I firmly believe in equal rights but in what is very much a children's game with talking animals, I fail to understand how it was necessary to include these references.  Why do sexual preferences even need to play a part in a game such as this? Without warning, the creators have chosen to include references that feel out of place and a bit like pandering. I'm left scratching my head and wondering, ""Why?"" And if it was so important to include, why was it left out of other versions? Can't we decide what we deem appropriate for our home and kids rather than having Nintendo make a blanket determination of our culture and then plopping something into the game that they won't even include in their country's version? It's just an odd choice for this type of game. If this seems vague, search it out. The information about this is available. Another issue along these lines is the deletion of gender. I'm aware that there was a group of people that wanted non-binary options in the game, but it seems that gender pronouns have been erased entirely in only the US version. Players are referred to as ""they"" and ""their"" by the animals. This is probably my biggest gripe. There is a VERY small population of the US that identifies as completely non-binary. Of that group, it's another small population that plays animal crossing, but any references to ""she"" and ""he"" have been replaced in the game with ""they."" My entire family would prefer to have our pronouns of ""she"" or ""he"" used but, so far, this is not an option. It would be great if we could at least choose to have standard pronouns acknowledged rather than erasing the option entirely. An update would take care of this.As far as some of the changes, like crafting your own tools, there is good and bad. It can be fun to get new plans for building and it adds an element of excitement as the game progresses. However, it can be incredibly tedious trying to constantly gather resources for the many tasks you will have thrown at you. And as the first player, you will be hogging resources the other players will need as well and there simply aren't enough to go around at first. I quickly grew tired of having to gather, gather, gather for Nook's demands when I really wanted to just explore the island.  But much of your exploration largely depends on getting those things done.Also, some islands start off with only about a quarter or less of the island available to build on. We stupidly chose one of those not realizing we wouldn't have access to the rest of the island for a while. This meant we had to place four human player tents, two animal tents, the museum, and Nook's nephews' shop all in the same tiny area. Needless to say, some of us are relocating as soon as that becomes an option because we're all horribly cramped into one space. Keep in mind, relocating is expensive. It becomes more expensive as the game progresses and you gain more control over the island's design.As for some of the positives, the graphics are lovely and pleasing. The island setting is fun and the water, the sounds, the scenery are awesome. This makes for delightful game play. They nailed the sound of rain, the distant rumble of thunder, the wind picking up in the afternoon- such fun elements!! Visiting other islands is a cool bonus even if it does get a bit tedious when four islands in a row are pretty much the same,  but it's a great way to pick up resources. The animal characters are more interactive, have more personality, and are fun to watch as they seem to do their own thing rather than walk around aimlessly. In spite of its flaws, there is something delightful and addictive about the game.Some fun bonuses: tarantulas are a bit easier to catch, you can uproot trees and just transplant them whole from other islands if you eat fruit first, and you can bring harder to find flowers in crossbred colors from other islands and transplant them on your island (this is rare however!). Also, after acquiring shoots from other islands, you can grow bamboo on your own island. This is a fun bonus, however, so far, I've visited about about 8-10 other islands and haven't seen another type of fruit other than my own and only came across bamboo once. My son has visited other islands about the same amount and has only seen one other type of fruit.All in all, this game offers some pleasant entertainment and a nice escape from real life for a bit. I'm giving it sound  3 stars because the verdict is still out- I need to see how things develop before I decide if this was a fail or if it will unfold nicely over time. Overall, there is some disappointment and frustration, but the positives are worth noting so I can't pan it. Hopefully, as time passes and updates are made available, we'll be pleasantly surprised, but until then, I'm not going to gush about this game.Edited 3/27: I'm going to add another half star to one star. Things are picking up and there are more fun bonuses we've discovered as a family as we've played. The other players still don't have as many diy plans as the original player and they've missed out on some things because of their status in the game, but those things become less important as the game progresses. A few still cause issues but we're hoping that will be fixed in the future. In the meantime, there are a lot of things that make this game worth playing and it's easy to see the incredible work that was put into creating the game. So. . . For our family of six, we're currently giving it 3.5 to 4 stars after one week of consistent game play.Edited 4/21: Plan on having to spend a LOT of time to get the necessary DIY recipes to create furniture. The game is designed to absolutely need an online connection and to play with friends so you can get every type of fruit, flower, DIY recipe, etc. Count on months and months of consistent playing in order to unlock a few things to decorate your house unless you catalog with other players. Count on a lot of repeat DIY recipes you won't need, few furniture options for long periods of time, and count on having to track down other players in online forums in order to catalog items or share resources because there is no other reliable method of getting what you need. I don't like my kids playing with strangers or inviting strangers into our island (I didn't in past AC versions and we did just fine) and I don't have friends who are playing so this puts families like mine in a difficult situation. I appreciate that there were more options in past AC versions for people who didn't want to do a lot of online play but it seems ACNH depends very much on online interaction and help. Hopefully some future updates will remedy this. In the the meantime, our score remains at around 3.5 to maybe 4 stars.",The Verdict Is Still Out,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,12 people found this helpful

Each player can have their own profile, and games saves are kept completely separate.Because of this, I was very surprised to discover that Animal Crossing: New Horizons goes out of its way to circumvent the profile system. The first player to play the game is given the full experience. All other players are given a downgraded experience. Parts of the game are just missing, like naming your island, or choosing its layout. And all players are forced to have the same island, with limited space and limited resources.If I'd known this, I wouldn't have purchased this game, as we have one Switch shared by two kids. How is it fair to let one of them be the ""island representative"", while the other is treated as a second-class citizen by the game? One can unlock things, invite others, etc., while the other can only do tasks that don't actually advance the story?I see others trying to excuse Nintendo's behavior here, saying ""Animal Crossing has always been like that"", but:1. This is false. On the 3DS you could only have one game save per cartridge, but you could use multiple cartridges with a single 3DS. On the Switch you need two separate consoles.2. When classic games with limited save slots are ported to the Switch, the number of save slots from the original are normally made *per-profile* on the Switch. For example, in Link's Awakening there are only 3 save slots. In the Switch version, there are 3 save slots *per-profile*. Likewise, one would expect that Animal Crossing would have one game save *per-profile* on the Switch.3. Having mis-features in the past is not an excuse for propagating them into the future.Nintendo went out of their way to make the game terrible for anyone but the first player. It's pretty clear that their motivation for this is greed. Instead, they've made me strongly consider returning this game, and avoiding their platform in the future.",BEWARE: Only works for one player per console,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,11 people found this helpful

It's peaceful, meditative and engaging. It is everything I love about this kind of game. It rewards adventure and whimsy, and I am loving working to slowly develop my island and invite new faces to it. I haven't felt so invested in a game like this, so fulfilled, since Stardew Valley.But here's the thing. I'm Player One of Three in my household. And for Player Two and Three, it is still enjoyable but a far less fulfilling experience.Having everyone on the same system share one island is not the end of the world. We personally like that. We would have liked the option to have our own private islands to sculpt, but whatever. What we don't like is that the experience P1 gets is not the same experience P2 and P3 get. I get to build relationships with villagers, I get quests to unlock buildings, I get to move the story forward--and they just kinda hang out and have to wait for me to do it. They don't get to actually participate in the story for the most part, and feel like bystanders in their own save of the game. Even their interactions with the villagers so far don't seem to matter as much. That just feels bad. I was so excited when I realized they would want to play this with me, and felt so sorry when I realized they would only get a fraction of the experience I was getting. Over the past couple of days, we keep stumbling over things they are ultimately missing out on or don't have access to as additional players, and I keep feeling the need to apologize.Not to mention, if any of us play to our hearts desire on any given day, the other two hop on later to find there is little for us to do, no resources left to collect. There are three of us. I have no idea how this island and its resources is supposed to support up to eight players.I hope the developers of this game seriously weigh the feedback they're getting on this and patch in something that at least attempts a compromise. Please give P2 + a unique storyline experience of their own that actually matters--something not tied to P1 progress.The Direct for this game asks, ""What kind of life do -you- want to live?""This household's answer: the kind Player One gets to have.","Beautiful and heartwarming game and story, but not so much for Player 2 onward.",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful

No complain.  It is the best Animal Crossing experience period.Biggest problem is that there is no way for your family members to have their own experience with the game fully.  There is one island and the primary user is teh only one that has the full access to the game.  Other users on the Switch profiles get to have ""secondary"" experience where you get to live in the island the primary user set up and have limited gameplay.This would not be an issue if it was on previous consoles where each console meant it belongs to a single user and multiple user/usage was not encouraged.Since Nintendo switched to account based system with multiple user to access single machine, it really makes no sense that they would make a game where other users are gimped and not allowed to have their own save files.This is compounded by the fact that the save files are stored in the internal memory of Switch unit.  This means even if you buy multiple copies of the game for your family members, they can not have their own full game experience on one device.

New Leaf was absolutely INCREDIBLE! It is the perfect game for the Nintendo 3DS and it is an insanely addicting game that is VERY hard to put down. The first 3-6 months I played new leaf anywhere between 2-5 hours per day. Then eventually I played it for 1-3 hours per day because there is ALWAYS something new to buy and do. I clocked in 1,325 hours for New Leaf according to my Nintendo 3DS playing time logs. My nephew accidentally started a new save file over my 1,325 hours file save. I stopped playing then cause I didnt feel like doing it all over again. Then, new horizons was announced and the whole world rejoiced! New Horizons absolutely blew my expectations of the game cause I was slightly worried the game would feel more like the portable version aka Animal Crossing: Wild Word for the original Nintendo DS and of course Animal crossing New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS. Now, dont get me wrong, both portable games were stellar and absolutely FUN. However, animal crossing fans still miss the original Animal Crossing gamecube game cause that game was truly the best animal crossing game. I am glad and happy to say that Animal Crossint New Horizons for the Switch, definitely brings you back to the joy of playing the original game on the gamecube. New Horizons has so much new additions added that it really feels like a BIG console game rather than a not so big game on the handhelds. I've logged about 15 hours already into new horizons and I've already put more time into New Horizons than I did with New Leaf during the first 48 hours of owning this game. One example of New Horizons many features in the game is the terraforming addition. Yes, you read correctly! You can move mountains and dirt in order to design your island EXACTLY the way you want it to be. Being able to cross a river without going around it by finding a different detour path, you can add dirt/ground into the river, then simply walk over to the other side of the land. Just wait till you unlock that feature in the game cause I never knew animal crossing needed a feature like that and I'm extremely happy the devs added that into the game. Anyways, I dont want to spoil anything else, just BUY this game asap. I strongly recommend you buy the physical copy of the game cause then if anything happens to your save file on the switch, you could end up losing it and never get it back due to Nintendo cloud saving feature being totally backwards. Only allowing one save file and each save file is for that specific switch you own. However, if you buy the physical copy of new horizons, at least your save file will always be saved in that cartridge copy of animal crossing new horizons.

They can see your profile, acct settings, accts you follow/mute/block, etc. Please!Bottom line: If you don't want to give Nintendo access to your life and you don't actually know other players in real life or from social media/forums, etc., then you're SOL.This game is a waste of money and insanely overpriced when you consider that a huge, open world game like Zelda Breath of the Wild costs maybe $5 more and is SO much more fun and satisfying to play.",What They DON'T Tell You,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

But while their criticisms are not without value, saying the game is 1 star is just being petty.  Let's break down the game and give it a verdict.THE GOOD:  Animal Crossing is a solid series.  It's not for the hardcore gamer.  But it's more of a beginners open world game.  It's got some super nice features.  Tons of islands to visit.  And you also get to customize so many aspects of the island life.  Very nice!  My wife loves the game.THE BAD:  Ugh, this is where the game goes off the rails.  First one island per console.  Imagine my surprise when I hope on to create my island after my wife first made hers and I realize, nope I have to play on hers.  What's up Nintendo?  You encourage multiple profiles on a console then won't let multiple profiles play it?  Are you indeed trying to get everyone to buy two Switches?  Seems greedy to me.  Secondly the 2 player is awful.  You are leashed to the first player.  I can forgive that.  But then you can't even collect items!  Unless you want to switch back and forth between 'leaders'.  What gives Nintendo?  Did you set out to make a very unfriendly multiplayer game?  Weird because that's not Nintendo's normal method of operation.BOTTOM LINE:  Mixed bag at best.  Single player this is easily a 4 star game.  Fun and appealing to the non gamer.  For multiple people playing the game together or apart, this makes it a hands down 1 star.  So I'll split it for 3 stars.TLDR:  4 star single player experience.  1 star multiplayer.  Only buy it if only one person in your household wants to play it.",An Island Getaway But It's Built on a Dump,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

I've bought every game since and have played Pocket Camp since day one and this is turning out to be an amazing game so far! But it still needs some work. It's easy to finish the storyline of getting K.K. and the terrain tools. After that the game is just repetitive. Water flowers, pick fruit, say hello to villagers, maybe catch a few bugs and make some donations... decorate a little and turn off and wait for the next day.I'm disappointed with the lack of ways to interact with villagers and do things for them. Most of the games had frequent chances to do little jobs for them such as catching them a certain fish or doing deliveries. I think I've had one of those pop up once in the past two weeks. The rest of the time it's repetitive dialogue and nothing interesting.The furniture is really limited compared to older games and though I love a lot of the new customisation options the games system is designed really heavily on you having to use online play to trade items with other people... a service you have to pay for monthly just to do. Which doesn't take into consideration that you need to have friends who also play the game. And also pay for that service.Clothing items are great! So many styles and options to customise your characters and I love that!Flower hybrids are an absolute pain in the rump to breed. The percentage of a rare colour popping up on some flowers is so low that it's barely worth the time and crafting resources to make the tools to water every day. As an example I have watered all of my roses every day since the game dropped and I have managed to get a single black rose, a single purple and two pinks. That's just sad.I'm hoping there will be future items added including the classic old styles of furniture as they seem really limited with what's available currently. There needs to be more customisation options for paths and fences especially. Want that classic white picket fence with a nice white wood path? Too bad. You get brown and more brown. That's it. Just brown. Unless you want grey stone... or brown dirt.Another issue is trying to collect recipes is a little bit of a nuisance. Some recipes require OTHER recipes.... which you could find tomorrow or never... it's all chance. Which puts a damper on the fun if you want to craft something but can't get the objects needed for it. Especially if you don't have friends to play with or they don't have the items/recipes either.I think my major issue with this game is that there is no volume or music control. There's points in the game that the music completely drowns out the sound effects and ambient noises of the game. The music is repetitive and grating on your ears especiallyif you plan to play for more than a half hour. Maybe I'm a little more sensitive to it because I'm autistic and I have issues with over-stimulation but the only way I can play this game is on mute because there's no way to lower the sound of the music and still keep sound effects and ambience noises like the wind, balloons or waves still on. It's a feature I think should come with every game and I'm a little annoyed it wasn't implemented.Overall I think this is a game worth owning and playing and I do enjoy it. It has a lot of fun new features the older games didn't have but there's also a lot of things this game is lacking which is sort of dragging down the enjoyment factor. But I'm holding out hopes of some amazing updates in the future implementing fixes and more features to make up for the let downs since the day it dropped. Fingers crossed!",It's really good!

If you look at some software companies and Animal Crossing, Animal Crossing is like 98 out of 100 and other software is like 65 out of 100.  It is really well written.However, the Digital Copy makes it a nightmare.  If you have 1 Digital Code on 1 Switch, it is still ok, but since 1 Switch can have only 1 island, your household may have 2 or 3 Switches later.  And then you may also buy the 2nd and 3rd Digital Code, again for $59.  However, now if you are the ""Adult"" or ""Mayor"" in the household and use your email on the 2 or 3 Switches to take charge, note that on the 2nd or 3rd Switch, it seems to have some issue of not allow addition players besides yourself, and you cannot let Susie visit Tommy on another Switch because the account mechanism claims that you are ""the same account"" or the same ""software owner"" and can only play 1 copy at a time.  So it seems Nintendo has no concept that you own 2 Digital Copies.  It only has concept that you own A DIGITAL COPY.  But if you buy the physical cartridge, the problem all goes away.  You can play on any Switch, as any player, and Switch and Animal Crossing will have no complaint whatsoever.I don't know if there will be law later on saying YOU HAVE to treat Digital Copy like it is a cartridge.  So people who paid $59 x 2 for 2 Digital Copies should have the same playing ability as a person who paid $59 x 2 who bought 2 cartridges.  If the person who has the Digital Copies is forced to pay another $59 or even $59 x 2 to buy the cartridges so that his game play is not hindered, it is not entirely fair.","The game is 6 star, but the Digital Copy mechanism is 1 star",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

Skin tones— can’t remember) but it’s enough to have some fun. Nook tickets! I thought they were going to be lame like the voucher system on Animal Crossing Pocket Camp but they are actually cool because you can use them to pay off your home, buy things, and probably other stuff I haven’t discovered yet. There are four island layouts to choose from which are quite similar but have a ton of water features which I love (WARNING: there are no bridges so if you plan to build your house somewhere far north you’re not as there is no early access to land blocked off by water). The DYI feature allows you collect cards (ie fishing pole, net, etc.) to learn how to build those items for free after collecting the right amount of items (sticks, weeds, etc). That being said, poles and nets break after time meaning you’ll have to collect more items to build them in Nooks Workshop (free but annoying).

There's a lot to love about this game, and it's a welcome break during the Covid madness, but there are also a lot of oversights that make this game quickly becoming lame for me.What I love:- Relaxing - Simple activities without much of any action. You fish, you plant flowers, you interior design. That's about it.- UI/Design - The simplicity of the design for things like fishing (no on-screen icons, just you, your rod, and the water). The characters are also super cute.What I don't like:- Multiplayer - We bought one copy to share on our single device, with two separate online Switch accounts. My partner and I were forced to share the same island. Further, only the FIRST person to play the game gets to progress the story (e.g. unlockable events from Tom Nook like building bridges and getting key recipes).- Repetitive simple tasks - You need to eat food to do heavy-lifting chores like digging up trees. You need to eat each food item individually, so in order to move 10 trees you need to eat one apple 10 times, which is annoying because each apple takes about 10 seconds to eat.- A culture of prioritizing grinding (i.e. requiring the user to spend countless hours playing to unlock simple upgrades) - There are many ways to use the game design to get money quickly, such as tarantula hunting. Granted, some of them I'd consider ""cheating"" such as changing the timestamp of your Switch to move ahead in time, or duplicating expensive items, which I support them getting rid of as they aren't fair and against the point of the game. With each new update that has come out, they've found ways to ensure people can't make money quickly. The tarantulas on islands is a popular one, but they have been making it difficult to actually make use of it - such as adding ""water bugs"" that force tarantulas to not spawn, or adding 3-layer islands so you have to constantly use pole-vault/ladder which is very time-consuming. Some people don't want to spend 30 hours of gameplay fishing for the same fish, so why force people to do this?- Online play: You have to go to the airport and open/close the gate, and unless you do this, you can't do many actions on your island such as redecorating. Again, a waste of time that they seem to encourage.- ""Second active player"" - When someone ""dials"" in another user on the same Switch, they can follow the main player around. However, there isn't much that player can do aside from simple emotions and using tools. Picking up items is time-consuming (again) as it does a celebration graphic for every single item. There's no access to your inventory. And when the second player is away from their controller, there is no ""auto-follow"" option which makes the camera angle a huge hindrance to the primary player.I think this game can be good, but it's got a lot wrong with it that seems to be intentional by the game designers. All in all a fun game, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason other than to visit my island. :-P","Massive grinder, relaxing, but lots of development oversights",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

I've been playing the Animal Crossing games since the early 2000s, with the original GameCube version, and then City Folk for the Wii, and I bought a DS just so I could play New Leaf. I actually bought my new Switch to play the latest incarnation, New Horizons, due to the many raves from my online friends, even though I literally just bought my 3DS last year. Keep in mind that I'm in my 30s, so I think I'm a bit older than the target audience for these games, but it's a franchise I've enjoyed since I was a kid and continue to enjoy to this day as an adult, which is one of the wonderful things about the Nintendo franchise as a whole: they're a family oriented game company with cross-appeal and hugely rich in nostalgia.New Horizons is a bit different from previous editions in several key ways. The way that might be of most import to parents with multiple kids is that you can only have ONE FILE per game. One island. I said in my original review that only one player can play, but looking at other reviews, it seems like that might be incorrect. I don't know, because I didn't try it, but I edited my review just in case. That said, since you can decorate the whole island (more on that later) and have a house with multiple rooms, you could divide the island into quarters, so sharing is possible, but it could totally be a pain-- especially for kids who can't or won't share. Supposedly, multiple players can build multiple houses on the same island but resources are pretty sparse and there isn't THAT much to do, so it would be hard to support multiple users without a lot of compromise and co-op.In New Horizons, it's a bit RPG-like in that you perform side quests for ""Nook Miles"" which can be exchanged for exclusive items and other things. You also harvest raw materials to make tools and furniture, which you earn ""DIY recipes for."" If you don't want to carve up your island to get resources, that's okay. The Nook Miles let you go on a ""Mystery Island tour"" with tickets that take you to a randomly generated island. Each randomly generated island has a body of water for fishing and trees of some kind. As long as the trees are not exclusively bamboo or fruit trees, there is one furniture leaf hidden in one tree on the island and you have a good chance of finding a recipe bottle on the shore. Some of the islands are extra-special: there is a scorpions-only island, a goldfish/koi/carp island (which makes catching the relatively rare ranchu goldfish easy), a trash fishing only island, and a money rock island, along with a couple other fun ones. Regardless of which one you get, they are a great way to chop down trees and harvest resources like weeds. You get the DIY recipes through the Nook store, redeeming Nook Miles, from balloons, washed-up bottles on the beach, and from villagers, or as gifts from other players. The DIY items are really fun and can't be bought in-store, which is a great motivator to seek out recipes to complete your sets and go on lots of tours to harvest additional resources.Unlike other games, this version seems to have way less furniture. I haven't gotten any gyroids yet, and I'd be sad if Nintendo discontinued that feature, as those fire hydrant shaped critters were such a fun part of the game. There also aren't as many series and the focus seems to be on customization-- changing the wood, the fabric covers-- and getting little accessories to personalize your home, ranging from nail polish collections to plates of popsicles, that really give your home a lot of personality. Today, I got a recipe for a fruit infused water canister, for example. I like how you can stack furniture and customize so much, but I do miss the series, especially the lovely furniture and the sweets furniture. The original also had a whole bunch of NES games that you could collect and actually play, like Balloon Fight and Wario's Woods, and I'm not sure those are in this version, which makes me sad.The coolest thing about this game is being able to customize literally the WHOLE island. Furniture. Can. GO. OUTSIDE. This is not a drill, people!!!! Do you think your sofa should go on the beach? Do you want to put a bed in the forest??? GO RIGHT AHEAD. The world is your oyster (and yes, there's furniture for that, oyster-shaped beds, anyone?). You can terraform, creating cliffs and waterfalls, expand or fill in rivers, create ponds and lakes... it's really, really cool. My town has about fifty waterfalls now, just because.The game rewards you for exploring and playing frequently. You get Nook Miles for milestones or triggering random events. You start out with version 1.1 until you install the updates. Before the updates, there isn't much you can do... a lot of the visitors who sell cool things don't come without the updates and you won't have the neat Halloween stuff or the pumpkins. The only cool thing in 1.1 that isn't available in later versions is hybrid flower island, where you get the two most common hybrid versions of your flowers in abundance. But that isn't a huge miss, and the updates are SO COOL. I love growing pumpkins and building Halloween furniture, and I hear another update might be in the works for Mario-themed furniture, so I'm excited!!!!I know with beloved franchises like this, there are always going to be beloved features from previous games that people will miss. In the first game, you could store additional items in your opened mail. New Horizons compensated for that by giving you the chance to redeem your in-game Nook Miles for pack expansions. I also miss the inclusion of the tropical island you could visit, which was in both New Leaf (where you could play mini games, get exclusive item sets, and addition fruits like bananas, lychees, and durians, and it was always summer) and the original (where you could get additional fruits like coconuts, get exclusive item sets, see island exclusive animals, and it was always summer). I also miss the feature in the first game where you could ask animals if they wanted favors and literally spend a couple hours doing favors for the animals. Here, it's much more random. And then there was the ability to play classic NES games! I miss that so much.Overall, I think this is a really incredible game. The graphics are AMAZING and I love how the items you place outside cast shadows that change with the time of the day, and how the cycle of the moon syncs with the current cycle of the moon IRL, and I think it's so cool that if you have a fan in your home, it ruffles the leaves of your plants. Someone had to code all of that in, and it's just really incredible. The way the breeze periodically picks up and ruffles the leaves of the trees is also really cool. Also, wishing on shooting stars and picking up the star pieces that wash up on your beach the next day is a really magical feature and the star/space furniture stuff is neat.Honestly, I miss all the extra fruit, doing the unlimited favors for animals, and having so much furniture to collect (GYROIDS! *weeps*), as well as having your own personal gyroid butler outside your house to act as a mini store, but the inclusion of so many other features makes it a bittersweet loss and not a bitter one. Every day I play the game, I discover something new, and it's the way that the game encourages you to build and explore that makes it such a positive experience. I was telling someone that it's like a little zen garden with cute animals; it's so relaxing, especially during these unusual and stressful times, and I think if you can get the game, you should.",This is one of my FAVORITE games!

As many others have said a family cannot share a switch and this game and have the same experience. The other players will get a severely reduced experience in this case. You can only have one island per switch console and only one player can be the lead no matter what. The save files are on the switch console and cannot be moved or uploaded to the cloud for the cloud saves feature.If you are a single player who only plays one switch console this is the best case scenario and you won't have to worry about anything, but if you are a family who all share one switch console its going to be a big problem for this game.You can also only do so much in this game per day, then you have to wait for the next day for things to happen, this is half the fun of it, but this type of thing might not be for everyone.  I am not sure of the longevity of this game, as after day 3-4 I find myself already getting bored with it. Doesn't seem as good as previous entries in the series and as far as multiplayer online goes that feature doesn't seem to work too well, and not a lot to do in multiplayer. If you played an AC game before, this is basically the exact same game as older versions with of course a few new features added in. The bugs and fish are the same and the fossils and museum are the same basically.In this case it would benefit the player to have more access to tools in the first day of the game not having to get them later on. You won't be able to reach your whole town on the first day of the game which ruins some things. It is like when you get all the good equipment at the END of any other game, instead of giving it at the beginning when the player could actually use it. If this something that annoys you, don't buy this game.This game has a massive flaw in the fact that the tools you are using break, and you are required to craft new ones whenever that happens. If you haven't played this game before, tools are completely essential to gameplay and you need to use them for the entire time you are playing. Unfortunately that happens extremely often to the point where its ruining the game.This still stands but oh my gosh, after playing for 20 or 30 days the game TOTALLY OPENS UP! Here is what happens, after a certain amount of time playing you get this thing called terraforming. This lets you literally transform your island into anything you want. This is quite literally, the best feature of the game. You can FINALLY knock down those cliffs and make your island easy to navigate. You can make custom patterns. You can quite literally, do anything you want with the layout of your island. From what I can see from playing you have to get at least a 3 star island, you can do this by having no more than 220 trees on your island, plant the flowers around the trees, spread out the flowers. Get a few more villagers to join you. You want to get KK Slider to have his first concert, you can get this by again, achieving a 3 star island. I think it took me about 20 to 35 days, it may take longer or less. The problem is you have to get to this point, and as I said before its a grind, this is not for the impatient.","You need one switch and one copy of this game for each player, must play alone for best experience",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

You based the whole game around trading with others what do you think was going to happen? Nintendo was only angry about it because they weren't the once profiting of the trade sales. Nintendo trying to regulate how we play the game really left a bad taste in my mouth and the game got boring really fast, I haven't touched in over 9 months.",Not happy with what nintendo did to the game,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

I always buy the big releases from Nintendo, and was thinking about passing this one by because I haven’t gotten in to this series before... but I am glad I gave it a shot!This game is super chill.You have a character on an island and do things like:- Search for materials such as wood, stone, clay, iron, tree branches, etc.- Find recipes to craft things. These might be given to you by other people on the island, found in a bottle on the shore of a beach, etc.- Craft things like tools, furniture, campfires, etc.- Visit a store that has different merchandise each day.- Go fishing.- Capture insects- Dig up fossilsThe typical gameplay loop for a given day is something like: go around and gather materials (there is a set amount you can get each day), search the beach for bottles that might have crafting recipes, visit the store to see if there is any interesting stuff for sale, craft/sell any items to the store that they are buying for extra $$ on a given day, dig up and donate fossils to a museum on your island. You collect money in the game by either just finding it or selling stuff, and can use it to upgrade your home from a tent, to a house, to a bigger house, etc (with more room to put stuff).The game seems to be intended to play in small chunks on a daily basis, which I actually really like. It has a lot of charm, is very relaxing to play, and has a really enjoyable gameplay loop that is fun but low stress. On the surface it seems like there’s not a lot to the game, which is part of why I have not gotten in to this series in the past, but playing this one I feel like I finally get it.

So I will say that when the ads for this game came out I was kind of negative about the whole thing- it looked so different from the older games and I was wary of it. But let me say that I honestly think this is the best Animal Crossing game since City Folk and possibly even on par with it. First of all the art is incredible- it's a new twist on the old style but it's so amazing to watch (even just the way the wind is animated to blow) that you can't be anything but impressed. The new crafting features on the island lend so much more possibilities for the game- no more days of wandering around the town wondering what to do with your day because you've done so much fishing and bug catching there's kind of no point. It's honestly a bit like Minecraft and Animal Crossing had a cool superior baby of a game and it definitely gets you hooked. Blathers is back and there's the option for him to give his old speeches that old fans will remember from earlier games. All in all, it keeps to the old Animal Crossing tone much better than New Leaf (definitely better than Welcome Amibo or Campground) with lots of cool new features that really fit in well with the old spirit.

Unfortunately for me it just didn't keep me invested for longer than a month with all of the other games I wanted to play. Its a very repetitive game and somewhat limiting for what you can do in a day. The game revolves around your real time and some of the elements like moving the position of a house or building are annoying because you can only move one building at a time and have to wait till the next day to move another building. You can however do something called “Time Traveling” to move time faster but its a very clunky process  that brings me out of the game so I decided not to do it more than once.

Total ripoff, right?  Indeed.

This is only possible with multiple Switch consoles and copies of the game since the game data is stored on the Switch.

Kind of on the vulgar side at times but they have toned it down and upped the clean humor so much I have found it fascinating.For a teen to adult I would give it a 5 star for a small child I would give it a two or three and say do not let the child play this alone as they may get so upset at the animal shenanigans they break the Switch like my friends kid does to her phones when she lets him play games on them and they get harder and harder each level where he gets frustrated.

There are just some little details that can improve the game play such as faster and more convenient island building features and unlimited shopping cart for shops for fast check out. There's a great video on YouTube about quality of life improvement suggestions for this game that makes me wish Nintendo sees.The prices to move buildings is INSANE but it's a game. But what I think definitely needs to improve is the multi-player option. I wish there's also an option to use two remotes for the 2nd player and for them to have the same power as the 1st. It's annoying having to switch off to access inventories. I also think a split screen should be implemented for multi-player use (think Mario Kart) so that the players can have fun building the island together.

Plus, they took notes from Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer with how you can arrange your furniture. It makes decorating rooms much more interesting and less frustrating.The graphics, of course, have improved from the last game. New Horizons is very pleasing to the eye. Nighttime is my favorite because the sky looks phenomenal, and I adore waiting to see a shooting star. Not only that, but they have vastly improved the graphics on clothes you can create! I find myself far more tempted to snag outfits from creators now that they're not so extremely pixilated.Lastly, the ways you can customize your island are endless. There is now terraforming. TERRAFORMING!! You can do almost anything to your island thanks to terraforming! I've seen so much creativity from people with this one tool. Plus, items can now be displayed outdoors however you want. Would you like a couch on the beach? That's weird, but go ahead!

Just upgraded the town hall and now that Isabelle is here, the background music is unbearably loud for me and the game doesn't have any way to adjust the sound. I have medical conditions that make loud music painful. Furthermore, I can no longer hear the balloon noises. I googled for a way to fix this and found many others having t hff e same issue after the town hall upgrade. If you are sensitive to loud music, this game doesn't care about you and I would suggest not buying it. Update: This is an update to my original review. There were 3 things that bothered me, fixed camera position,  no way to invert Y axis, and, for those who work all day, you are basically playing in the dark as game time is your real time. After playing for a week or so, I have adapted to the camera position and, while still bothersome,  the y axis. Having the game run on real time is still an issue for people who work long hours. For example,  if you can't play on Sunday  mornings before noon, you are going to miss a weekly event. You can adjust the time by changing your switch time, but I found when I did that, then changed back to the real time, I lost one type of progress in the game, so it isn't ideal.  All in all, though, my opinion has risen much higher than the original rating.

I could never fully invest myself in it, and even though I would come back to it, and replay it in an attempt to understand what people liked about it so much, I eventually dropped it.When this game was announced, I was never planning on buying it. It was only around release time that I started to take an interest in it, and I eventually bought it, thinking it would be different than NL. I was correct in this thinking. I have invested over 175 hours into the game thus far. I think what sets it apart from NL is the level of customization that it includes. The ability to customize your entire island, including the location of resident’s houses, shops, and anything else you can think of (with the exception of Resident Services). Terraforming is also a very neat feature which allows you to make some truly impressive island layouts with ponds, rivers, waterfalls, cliffs, and ramps. You can also fully customize your character from their eyes, hair, skin colors, etc. It’s a far cry from the presets of previous games.The biggest and most annoying drawback would have to be that you can’t craft multiple items at once. If you want to craft 50 fish baits to catch that rare fish you’ve been wanting, you’ll have to spend a good 15 minutes at the DIY bench just pressing buttons over, and over, and over again.A nice feature to add would also be the ability to fast-forward through certain dialogue options, like talking to Blathers when you want to donate or have him assess something.It’s a great little game with a few drawbacks, but I’d say it’s definitely worth it’s price.",Huge Improvements to the Animal Crossing Formula,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I didn't buy them both for myself, I bought the digital copy for myself on launch day, and have been playing on my island for nearing on ten months. I bought my most recent copy for my step-nephew for the holidays and I hope that once I give it to him he will seriously appreciate this game as I did playing the Animal Crossing games since Wild World.There's new elements to the game that significantly changed the Animal Crossing formula such as ""DIY,"" which is just ACNH's term for crafting, the player character and villagers live on a deserted island, which you can now add furniture and rearrange homes to make it as lively and as organized as the player chooses, rather than a small town, in which you stuck with what you have, and couldn't change as much. Same as the previous installments, you can catch bugs and fish, dig for fossils, and in the newest update you can dive under the sea to catch sea creatures like in New Leaf, this game is overall one of the best modern Animal Crossing games we have gotten.That isn't to say this game is perfect. On launch day, there was no way to save your island to the internet, it could only be saved to the console itself, so if you were to move a Switch profile to another Nintendo Switch, and that was the only profile that played the game, you would lose all of your progress and it would he difficult and sometimes downright impossible to get back. Luckily this problem has been somewhat solved, but that left a bad taste in my mouth that the developers didn't consider what certain players experiences might have been. And that isn't the only problem with ACNH, but that was one of the biggest ones.Overall, if you think the player would like lax gameplay and creating your own goals rather than them being shown to you, this is probably a good game for you to pick up. If not, you can try to play it anyway, but I'm unsure if you'll appreciate the concept, which is also okay. Everyone's different.

If you have ever played a larger game like World of Warcraft or Skyrim where crafting was just supposed to be a very (very) small part of gameplay but you spent all your time, bag space and bank space getting and storing materials...this is the game for you.

Customization is virtually limitless and it introduces the option of terraforming the land itself. The ways you can build up your island stretch beyond the imagination. New Horizons introduces crafting, seasonal items and recipes, download-based events that last longer than one day so they really feel like holidays, and advanced character customization right from the beginning. I'll break down the pros and cons at the end of my review.I think there is some confusion, especially for people new to the series, regarding how multiplayer works.Animal Crossing has always been a ONE town/island game, with the option for up to 3 more players to share that land, since the idea is that you'd be building your oasis together. Unfortunately the co-op in this version is lackluster, especially since the Switch is marketed as a more social console than others Nintendo has released in the past. The multiplayer in a single town is, plain and simple, not worth it. Like others have said, you can really only play follow the leader and collect things together. It kinda defeats the purpose of true multiplayer mode, which is much more comprehensive in the console-to-console visiting (as it has been in the past as well). The true fun in multiplayer for ACNH is in visiting other islands entirely, seeing how they have built and organized their land, and exchanging exclusive fruits and rare items with each other (not to mention hitting each other endlessly with nets). If you have multiple consoles in your house or have friends with their own Switch and copy of the game, you'll find LOTS of enjoyment in the multiplayer.PROS:- Character customization is great. Skin tone is finally a choice, alongside many hairstyles and colors which become unlockable over time. Many basics are included right from the beginning and can be changed whenever you'd like.- Able Sisters is a true boutique. Every day they have a large stock of clothing, including many color variants. You can also layer multiple facial accessories.- Designing is a joy. The designer feature seems to ""read"" what shapes and colors you use and will round out sharp edges. This means any user-designed paths, stones, and clothing will blend in seamlessly with the soft graphics of the game. You can choose from different styles of clothing while you design, such as sweaters, robes, bowler hats, and beanies. Additionally, there is now an option for transparent patterns. No more having 4 different stepping stone designs for every season so the grass around your rocks will blend in with the natural grass. There is also a ""face paint"" option, which is very useful for equipping your character with eyebrows, freckles, etc.- Nook Miles ticket islands are worthwhile to work for, and allow you access to more crafting resources that you may have exhausted out of your own island for the day. They also have a chance to spawn rare creatures, Bell rocks, foreign fruits, and hybrid flowers.- The graphics have received a huge update. Everything in the game, including returning items, has a new model and looks better than ever. Wind rustles trees, flowers, and even items that have hanging bits, such as the clothing racks.- Your storage system is automatically built into your home, and home design is streamlined into a drag and drop menu for easy decorating.- Being able to put any item outdoors and build pathways has transformed the possibilities in this game. You can make so many things: trading booths, actual gardens, shop stands, playgrounds, cafes, spas, raffles, relay races, you name it. I've seen an incredible amount of creativity in the first week of release.- You can choose where your new villagers will move, and move any building at any time, save for the plaza and Resident Services within it. There is a cost involved but it's well worth it if you hate where something is placed.- So far I have not yet reached the cap on constructing inclines and bridges. You can make a bunch.CONS:- Terraforming takes a bit to unlock and can be finicky to navigate. You may think you're standing on the correct tile to place a path or build a cliff, but you'll be pushed to another tile, have to erase, and try again. Understanding where you are in space is just a little more difficult because the layout of your island looks a lot less geometric than it did in the past, but overall that is still a positive. Just makes terraforming a bit harder.- In the 3DS New Leaf: Welcome Amiibo version, scanning an Amiibo card would allow you to replace any resident villager with the one on your card, and they would move in the next day. In this version, scanning a card will put the villager in your campsite, but you must invite them to move in THREE times before they will agree. It just seems like a bit of work, since any random villager you find on a Nook Miles Island will move in the very next day after you ask them.- This is my big one: Blathers' museum, while changed drastically to be incredibly beautiful, no longer displays facts for donated creatures. Reading a sign will just give you the name of the creature and donor. To learn about a creature, you need to have it in your inventory and give it to Blathers under the request to learn more. This feels like a huge hit to the museum which is already lacking features. It seemed like they removed the one main reason to visit.- No sign of my favorite NPCs, Katrina (fortune teller) and Brewster (cafe owner). Hopefully, though, there are plans to implement them at a later date, as the game receives regular updates.Overall, this is a staple in any casual gamer's collection, a great intro for anyone new to the series, and something pleasant to pick up whenever and wherever, regardless of whether you have countless hours or just a few minutes.

I said SOME parts because for the most part I really like it, but the parts I dislike are:You can't terraform beachesYou can't make corner waterfalls, so you can't make your waterfalls wrap all the way aroundIf you need to relocate something it costs 50,000 WHOLE BELLS (I even have money trees and not native fruit to sell but it still costs too much!)And some random aspects of the game I dislike:It doesn't tell you how to plant fruit trees (I had to Google it)The bamboo island is SOOOOO hard to get (I still don't have bamboo!)When you go on a Mystery Tour you always get your native fruit (I still don't have apples and pears)That's all that I dislike about the game, I hope you consider changing those aspects of the game, and for the most part it's a great game, I am really happy that you made it!",I LOOOOVE THIS GAME,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,

It's a very relaxing, easy way to get lost in a different place while we are all locked down in our towns because of COVID-19.

This means that it is possible for one person to hoard all of the resources. DON'T HOARD THE TOILET PAPER!- Works in real time, so you are forced to be patient.....

Of course you have to play the game to get to the point where you have free reign to re-design your island but it's worth every chore to get there.

If it weren't for Nintendo's obvious money grab, I would rate this five stars. If you are unaware, only one island can be made per switch console. That means if more than one person in your house plans on playing, you will have to share the island, even if you own more than one copy of the game.Which brings me to my next point; if you plan on playing with people on the same console at once, you are stuck within the same screen. This means that whoever is the current person in control decides where everybody goes. You are unable to be playing on different parts of the island at the same time which severely limits game play. It almost feels intentionally bad to force you to buy another game and switch so you don't have to deal with the horribleness of multiplayer playing.The players not in charge are also unable to go into their inventories and anything they collect automatically gets sent to the island recycle bin, which has a capacity. This means that when they are finally the leader during multiplayer playing or playing single player they then have to go back to the recycle bin and recollect the items from it one by one.In all honesty, if I was in a household where more than one person was often playing at the same time, I would probably knock another star off because multiplayer is just that horrible. But as it stands, I am mostly the only person that plays in my house, so for single player my rating stands at 4 stars.","Fun game, but only if one person plans on playing",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Unfortunately, I got a copy for myself and for my 2 nieces and nephew so I could play with they live in a separate state. I've been having a great time, them, not so much. They are fighting, yelling, screaming and crying because the leader keeps ""popping"" them where they don't want to go. My sister fixed it by having them only play 1 at a time so local multiplayer is a useless feature in my opinion. I've been visiting my oldest niece's character and decided to visit the younger one but it turns out you can't just link 1 Nintendo account to all users on the switch and use the paid subscription to do any multiplayer unless you are the main player of the game. My oldest niece had to clear out her inventory so they wouldn't mix up what's her and her's sister after the younger one visited me with her sister's character. It was such a headache to call them up and try to help them over the phone to only realize they couldn't do it and we had to figure something else out.Personally, I give it 5 stars for the single player since it's a slightly better version of the previous games. I've been enjoying myself and so have my nieces. Just NEVER TOGETHER (remember this rule and it will save your family a massive headache).  This was suppose to be a positive review but knowing the experience my sister and brother-in-law went through, I'm compensated the rating. It's like older animals crossing games except now you're locked to 1 island per console instead of 1 town per cartridge but $260-$360 is far more expensive than just an additional $50-$60. I can get why people would be mad. I hope Nintendo fix the ""Call Resident"" issue or just get rid of it altogether.

Multiple players can play the game on one system, but must share an island together, thus giving those additional players a comparitvely limited experience.
