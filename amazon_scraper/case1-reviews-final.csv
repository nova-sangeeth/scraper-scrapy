It hasn't even been 6 months, and one of the ports don't charge anymore. TBH, after doing some review reading, I was excited about this charger.  I bought one for myself and one for my friend. I'm not sure how his is doing or how often he uses it (I don't think that should matter regarding the ports, I can understand if the battery dies over time....hopefully not a short amount of time).  I usually use it over the weekends, and took it on another weekend trip to find my self short a charging port. Definitely annoyed!EDIT 11/08/16: I was contacted by their customer service team the following day after writing this review. Their team was very pleasant to deal with and quick with their responses. Within a day or two, they've already sent out a replacement for the faulty PowerCore 20100 I purchased a couple of months ago! If all goes well, I'll be updating this review again! Great customer service from Anker!EDiT 2/16/17: Anker's customer service is second to none! The replacement works as it should, but the wire would not charge the PowerCore.  After contacting their customer service team again, they were happy to replace the faulty wire sent with the replacement PowerCore. Great company that cares about their customers. I just wish products nowadays lasted longer, but regardless, I'll be buying their products again.",Don't expect much after a couple of months...,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,"1,341 people found this helpful",98336,27,1344

I have not used it too may times. But, occasionally I have charged Iphone, Ipad, and some portable speakers. It would basically charge all of them with a single charge to the PowerCore. Very nice!In May of 2018, I noted that when charging, the unit would get to the point where the last LED was blinking, but the lights would never turn off. Other than this, the ability to charge other devices seemed to be unchanged. However, this charging behavior made me wonder whether this was an indication of a potential failure beginning. Therefore I contacted Anker since I was still in their 18 month warranty period (just).I have to say that working with them has been nothing but a pleasure! They responded to me the same day via email. Asked for a few other troubleshooting steps, and then sent me a new one after the extra steps did not resolve the issue. And......they  let me keep the initial PowerCore which of course still works (for the time being)! Amazing.I am extremely pleased with this company and will continue to do business with them.

I personally travel a lot for work and I find myself needing battery juice for my devices on a very frequent basis. I carry 2 cell phones and 1 tablet for work.I obviously own couple of power banks to charge my phone during my flights or at the airports. I always thought it would be great if one these days they made a power bank which could charge all my devices few times and it wasn’t so heavy.  Well, guess what Anker PowerCore 20100 is the answer.First and foremost, the capacity of this device is amazing and recharging of your devices is superfast. The unit itself comes pre-charged to about 75%came charged, so you can start using it out of the box.My test: After recharging it to full 100%, I took it with me on my business trip. I was able to charge my Samsung S6 and iPhone 6 at the same time (from 30% to FULL 100% in less than 2 hours). The Power Bank still had more than 50% juice left.  I quickly plugged in my Samsung Tab S and charged it from 70% to Full 100% in less than 40 mins. I was surprised to see that the unit still had more than 50% juice left. Long story short, it took me full 2 days and almost 7-8 device recharges to drain it down to less than 25%. This unit has massive battery capacity. Since then I have ran multiple tests on this unit and it has NOT failed once to impress me.As far as size of the unit, I own old version of the Anker powerbanks and few other units from other manufacturers.  This one is a great improvement. This is probably good 25% lighter than older Anker models and it’s not as shiny as older models. I like the looks of this one better. Anker smartly got rid of the flash light feature which was nothing but a small LED. I personally never used that feature in my older model.The four status LEDs are great and pretty accurate to show the status of battery charge left.  Two USB ports allow charging, it’s rated at 2.4amp per port and total of 4.8amp. I think that’s pretty accurate during my testing. The unit comes with a single USB-to-micro cable and is charged via micro USB input on the side. It appears to be pretty well built unit that is both durable and attractive.For recharging the unit itself, it can take somewhere from 8-10 hours. Best is to leave it plugged in overnight and you will have an enormous power capacity for the busy day or even the week ahead.Anker customer service is the best I have seen, they are quick to respond and accommodating. The unit itself is backed by their 18 month warranty.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the battery pack and highly recommend it.  It's a great battery backup for those on the go or even at home if you don’t want long recharging cords from power outlet to your desk.Bullet Point Analysis:------------------------------------Great For------------------------------------ Business Travelers Families on vacation Busy Moms & Dads on the go Considerate co-workers who want to help colleagues with their charging needs at office =) College Students on long class schedules International travelers------------------------------------The Pros------------------------------------ Great form factor for the amount of battery power it packs Power capacity to charge your phone throughout the week (6-7 times) Accurate charging status and battery level LEDs Automatic power off PowerIQ feature to automatically route power to the device plugged in Excellent value for cost------------------------------------The Cons------------------------------------ None I can think of for what it promises. May be charge my laptop too =)------------------------------------The Specs------------------------------------ Dimensions: 6.5 X 2.5 X 1 Output: 2 USB/ 4.8A total Input: 5V / 2A About 1” bigger than Samsung S6 and 1.5” bigger than iPhone6 Substantially lighter than any other power bank with same capacity in the market. Capacity is as promised You can use your existing cell phone charger to charge the device------------------------------------Summary------------------------------------I think it’s established that in today’s digital and multi device environment our devices are power-hungry at all times. I have seen people at Airports, Hotels, Coffee Shops, Office Receptions, Disney World, Museums (yes), Casinos etc plugged into power outlets. Phones and tablets are more advanced but they need battery juice and manufacturers have conveniently taken spare battery option out of the devices e.g. Samsung.This Anker Power Bank makes perfect sense to carry for all your smart phone and tablet charging needs. You can't beat the battery capacity, size, weight, price for the use you will get out of it and to add its backed by a good company who listens to their customers.  I would say go for it!Please do let me know if this review was helpful to you. If it was not, let me know why in the comment section. I promise that my review is fair and honest.------------------------------------",Anker PowerCore 20100 – Review by a Frequent Flyer Business Traveler,Color: Black,"2,659 people found this helpful",64923,104,3476

I'll be sending this back.EDIT 04/2016: Anker reached out to me in private over a month ago, shipped me a new PowerCore free of charge and I confirmed that it was properly putting out over 1A. In addition to this, they replaced an older model PowerCore that had stopped working and I assumed was out of warranty, so I had taken it apart to diagnose what was wrong with it (bad capacitor). Not only did they ship me a replacement, but they let me keep the broken PowerCore so I could harvest the 18650 batteries from it.This is quality customer support and they probably ate a little bit of profit in assisting me.

The battery charged my electrical devices but wouldn't take a charge so while I was in the Philippines I came back on Amazon and researched Anker warranty. Now, this is my 9th Anker battery I've purchased from Anker Direct on Amazon and until now I've never had an issue, not one. I've given them out as gifts and everyone loves them. So, I emailed Anker with the requested purchase information and after an individual named Julia asked me a few questions a new Anker Battery was sent to my house in America and arrived exactly one day before I flew in from the Philippines. I can say that Anker's products are top notch but the real test of a company is do they actually support their warranty .

I used to have an older version/model with less charging power which we ran to the ground in a few years.  As a local semi celebrity in the Washington DC area, my girlfriend and I use our phones a lot!  We do facebook live, lots of pictures and videos.  We also have iPads and a Samsung tablet.  Not to even mention the many times we've bailed our friends out of not having a charger nearby hahahaha.This charger is amazing.  It does take a bit to charge, at least 12 hours + but when it does, even a heavy user like myself has juice for at least a week.  I love the IQ feature which to me means, it knows when charging is needed so it turns on and off and you don't have to worry about turning it on or off or worrying about it losing its charge for nothing.  That's peace of mind.  I love that it has 2 USB ports to charge two devices at once and I love the charge level indicators.  It's only 4 little lights so each one is 25%.  I very rarely let it drain completely as I like to keep it at 100% as much as I can unless I'm out with no access to charging it or no time.  Absolutely recommend it.  The Anker brand has proven to me in the last few years since using it that it is a solid brand you can trust and rely on.  I've even ordered some of their cable to use with this, they are of the best quality and well designed/material.","NO ELECTRICITY TO CHARGE YOUR MOBILE DEVICES, NO WORRIES...ANKER HAS YOUR BACK!",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,13 people found this helpful,2143448,79,30

Got the new one in the mail and it only showed 75% capacity as well.  I let it charge a few devices before it was completely drained and plugged it in to charge. This one, thankfully, charged to 100% and was able to charge several devices until completely drained.  Again, I plugged it in to charge, and again it charged to 100% capacity.  Anker customer service was great and did right immediately after I made the original post.  It does take a bit to recharge (at least 6-8 hrs) compared to my other power packs, but I'm assuming it's because it is larger than the others.  I knocked it down from full 5stars for the inconvenience, but would have given it a 4.5.  Otherwise, great product and great customer service.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Bought this before going on an overseas business trip. Was 75% charged when it came in so I plugged it in to charge overnight before my trip. It still showed only 75% the next morning before my flight but figured it would get me through the flight. It did get me through but would not completely charge during my trip. It would only charge to 25% during my trip. I figured it was because I was overseas and maybe the outlets weren't outputting what it needed to properly recharge. Long story short, got back stateside and it still will not charge completely and continues to charge to only 25% even after sitting plugged in for over 2 days. Unfortunately, I returned after I was able to return for a refund.","Wouldn't charge completely, but Anker fixed the problem",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,3007498,27,221

I just ordered a new pair of their bluetooth headphones. Anker NEVER let me down and has earned my hard earned money. If I need some kind of cable or power product, I always look at Anker first.That being said, this battery pack is absolutely no exception. I figured between power outages, and the occasional travel with the kids, I should have a solid battery pack for our electronics. I've also discovered that I have several other items that charge via USB and this battery charges everything. I have a set of GMRS 35 mile radios which charge via USB on the charging dock. This pack charges them up without breaking a sweat. Even my small emergency radio can be charged via USB. I'm discovering that a lot of my things can be charged from this pack, which is a great investment.It's got some solid weight to it. If you insist on packing light, you might want to consider a smaller pack from Anker. If you're looking for a lot of power in a small package, this one fits the bill. The two USB ports put out some great power at the same time. I've charged my Moto G4 Plus from zero to 100% in roughly 1 1/2 hour with the phone turned off which to me, is impressive. The four blue lights on the outside indicate how much of a charge you have and there's also a button you can press to get the power indicator lights to tell you how much juice you have. For the outdoors, I'd recommend purchasing a 10ft USB cable so the battery can stay in your pack, giving you more than enough cable to have handy for your GPS, radio, or phone. Anker makes some VERY nice cables that are perfect for the sportsman and the outdoors.For the family, this thing can be a big lifesaver, providing essential power during an emergency or family trip when the kids need some more tablet time or during a power outage. This also comes with a carry pouch and a 3ft USB cable which is a big plus. The only downside to this pack is the recharge time. It does take considerable time to recharge it (roughly 8-10 hours), especially if it's completely drained. In my personal opinion, I believe the slow charge is to ensure the pack charges efficiently and correctly, just like a traditional battery charger. I'd recommend charging this pack overnight and it'll be ready to roll in the morning. After using this pack for several months, I'd recommend it to anyone without reservation, especially for it's battery strength and size. This is just about as much power as you can take with you in a small package and it hasn't let me down once. I'd buy another one with zero hesitation.","You can't find this kind of portable power, at this price, that performs like Anker products perform.",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,185920,37,35

Opened the box, unboxed it all, saw there was two lights on power check, so I decided to power it up.Decided to charge it off my laptop (plugged in too), and while I have 2 USB ports on one side of the laptop, the connection to my wireless mouse was on the other next to it. I plugged in the power bank and the mouse stopped working.  I unplugged the wireless dongle and put it back in and it was fine. It was freaky. Why would a battery mess up my USB ports? BTW, my laptop is fully charged and is plugged in to charge the phone and the Anker.The instructions say the best charging is through an Anker power dongle.  I have no idea if any of the wall chargers I have are Anker or not, but as I just started working on my pc I figured it can just sit next to me and I can figure out if it gets hot.  My actual phone is also charging off the laptop of another USB on the other side of the laptop.The instructions say also that this is not quick charge cord. I guess that and the size is why it takes long to charge.  I honestly don’t think for the capacity of this bank it should take much longer.  I had a smaller powerbank over half the size, which died way out of warranty, so I took the chance on this one, and that one took about 6 hours for full charge.Ugh, to think I just moved my hand over and bumped the USB area and my mouse won’t work anymore. Goofy. I gave up and put in a wall charger for the night. After I picked it up I noticed that the mini, not the USB, the power to plug to charge is warm.  My other Power bank never got warm or messed up my USB.  I placed it in an area I can monitor in case the warm turns to hot or not. And I moved my hand over the USB plugs after this and no disconnections.Currently, the wireless dongle for my mouse is fine, mouse works, powerbank is charging across the room.So the next day the whole power bank is charged, lights off, and no hot spots on cables or bank, all lights light when power is pressed, good. I take the power bank with me and my S5 mini (yes, I am still limping along with this….) and I used Anker’s cable.  I had to run around and thought to test this.  I plugged my phone into the charger and when I started with 57% and I looked about ½ hour later it was 56%! I unplugged the cable from both the bank and the phone, reattached both, wiggled it until the phone told me it was charging,  and found the phone now charging and in about 1 hour I was 100%.This bank is huge compared to my phone, but I love that I can leave it in my purse or in a jacket pocket in case I need this. I think I just have a faulty cable.  With what I did so far, do you agree? Faulty cable? I  contacted Anker too.So the last few days I have been testing it. Still with the OEM cable, and placed it carefully in my bag, already attached to the phone. Again it was 50 or so percent and without taking the phone out, no emails or text or calls, and within an hour charged. The Anker showed 100%.  The next day I just tossed everything into my bag and no charging of phone. Had to take it out and re-plug it all and then the charge started fine and I had 100% in about an hour.The phone has now charged, even if it is freaky, up from 50-100% and shows full charge still.  Wigging is not good = I want secure connections. But I am thrilled with the performance of actual charging.Update 08/19/18I did contact Anker and here is a bit of the exchange:A: We regret to hear that you have some issues with your PowerCore 20100mAh. Actually, we also felt strange about the problem that when charging the PowerCore 20100mAh via the laptop, your mouse does not work. We never heard this issue before.As for the hot issue, please be advised that while using this battery, a little warmth is normal; but if it becomes too hot, it could indicate a fault. We normally suggest the customer use the 5V/2A wall charger to charge this PowerCore 20100. It generally takes 10-11 hours to be fully charged with a 2A wall charger, and 20 - 21 hours with a 1A wall charger. If you are using the laptop to charge it, the recharging time will be longer.In order to help us better record the problem, would you please try plugging in a different cable to charge your phone? Then we could know whether the problem lies in the output port or the provided cable. Does that make a difference? Please let us know the results.Me:  I used a new USB/mini cord with the power bank. Worked not any better. Had to wiggle and unplug and replug into both ports. Disconnect and reconnect my phone until charging happened. Then charged until I moved it.So the next day I let the USB/mini cable sit in the bank all night. I did not charge the bank.The next day;Checked the lights, all 5.Used new USB/mini cord, connected my phone, nothing, and switched back an forth. All nothing.A: Though we have strict control on quality with numerous inspection, on occasion a problematic product might make it out. Therefore, I have arranged a new PowerCore 20100 to your address. It generally takes 3-5 days to deliver to the destination. When you receive it, you could test it. And we will highly appreciate it if you could let us know how it works for you.To save your time, we do not need this product back on this occasion :) Hope the replacement arrives soon and works like a charm for you! Have a nice day!Me: That is great . Thanks.A: ~ a replacement is sent, I recycled the other one ~ BTW, the cable is fine it will charge anything I put on it....~~~Me: The new powercore 20100 is working great.  I can charge it from my PC and it doesn't affect my mouse.  It charges my phone many times and I am quite happy.So now I can just attach my phone, toss it all in a bag, and in about an hour my phone is charged. I am very happy with the powercore and Anker support.  To all, don't suffer with a less than stellar work from this, contact Anker.","First was broken, new one is Wonderful!

As for quick charge, it's the fast charge of previous gen aka roughly about 12W fast charge, it can charge a Samsung Note 8 from 1% to 50% in 45mins and 100% after about 2.25 hrs. Its pretty awesome overall at a reasonable price, the only drawback I can think of is it's a lil outdated & slow compare to similar capacity new models from anker. It charges via micro usb (super slow to charge up even when paired with a 30W wall charger) and has 2 usb A output ports of 2.4amp each.

Pokemon Go came out in June 2016, and I was playing frequently for long periods of time and this charger was just what I needed to keep playing all day. This charger was extremely reliable.  Didn't take long to charge, and the charge never decreased in output.  I have purchased other Anker portable chargers after purchasing this one.  The other chargers  I purchased where larger versions of this one.  This one was always my favorite, since it was a little smaller, but was dependable. It fit well in my back pocket, wasn't as bulky or heavy as the larger ones.I have continued to play Pokemon Go and other cell phone games since I purchased this charger in 2016. This charger has been used frequently since it was purchased. There were times that I would use it during the day, charge that night so I could use it again the next day.  I don't know how many times I have charged it over the past 4 years, not every day, but at least once a week if not 3-4 times a week.  This charger has two ports, and I frequently would have two devices connected charging. I tried to completely drain the battery before recharging it.This week the battery bit the dust. I am not able to charge it. I have tried different cables and wall adapters, and no luck. It lasted 4 years. Warranty is 18 months. I am disappointed that it finally bit the dust, just because it was my favorite. I have gone through more cell phones than Anker chargers since I purchased this charger.I am going to purchase the current version of this charger to replace the one that just died.  Amazing product, long life, excellent reliability, strong charging capability for the life of the charger.

I have found that the storage capacity is more then enough to charge and power all my equipment.  Over all I am very pleased with the 20100 mah power bank.  If you are thinking of recharging it with the Anker solar panel get the 26800 mah power bank instead.  From the feedback in other reviews, the 20100 drops to a trickle charge from the solar panel when a cloud blocks the sun and stays at a trickle even though the sun comes back out.  The 26800 mah power bank does not do this and resumes full charging power.  I have asked Anker if it is safe to charge my 20100 from a 26800 mah power bank and they said yes but do not recommend it.  Not sure why though.  As we said in the military 2 is 1 and 1 is none.

I loved how it worked and lasted for days charging my phone, so I bought one for myself. Now two years and seven months later, I finally wore my Anker battery out. Since my purchase, I have used my Anker on every bike ride, which is over 5,500 miles (that's a minimum of 600 hours, not including my non-bike use!). I also use it every time I ride transit, go to a meeting, or happen to be anywhere without a wall outlet because having a low battery on my phone is a pet peeve of mine. I love my Anker battery!

It was only able to do this if another device was also charging. This became a huge problem as I travel (pre-pandemic) often and was almost stranded a few times because I couldn't charge my phone long enough to call a car service. I eventually found a different device that was listed in a Popsugar add: PowerAdd Pilot 4Gs 120000 mAh. It was only $22 and I wish I'd seen it sooner so I could have originally bought it or returned the Anker. This charger ALWAYS charges my cellphone whether it's on 4G or wifi so the issue was clearly the Anker and not my phone. The PowerAdd has a lightning port which I don't really need so I'm going to buy the updated model which has USB, lightning, and micro-usb ports. I'll give my old one to my partner who has a work iPhone.UPDATE: After my review the company reached out to trouble shoot my issue. They sent a replacement charger at no additional cost. I still had some charging issues--my phone not charging when 4G is on, but they said this is likely an issue with my phone and not the charger. All in all I am much more satisfied, but I do wish it had a port for MacBooks. I'm going to need a adapter in order to charge my laptop when I'm out.PREVIOUS: I bought this for travel--I take several business trips a year and often have multiple meetings in a day and need to charge in-between. Previously, I was using the rechargeable battery that came with my AWAY suitcase but didn't want to overuse it/save it for trips. So far I've only used the PowerCore with my cell phone and whether or not it will actually charge it is hit or miss. Often it starts charging for a few seconds and then stops. The high ratings have me puzzled. I mainly bought this because it was reasonably priced and had such a high rating. I'm not sure it's worth keeping.",Another Update!!!

Since last year I made the switch and always bring this one with me in the majority of places.Pros:-I've brought it to Mexico for a week and a half on a single charge and was able to power my phone and my cousins when the hotel we were at had sketchy electrical outlets (it fried her hair straightener).-I've brought it on a 3 (3 weeks) domestic trips this summer and only had to charge it twice. During the entire time I would use it at night since my phones been draining its battery and haven't had time to drop by an apple store. Though my phone would drain quickly, I'd charge my phone twice a day using the battery. By the end of the week I'd notice my battery reaching a little under half way capacity and sometimes I'd forget to charge it at the airport.-I work and go to school so  I sometimes have 8 hour work days and 6 hour school days packed into the same day.  Since sometimes I'm often on foot and have no access to outlets, this has saved my phone a handful of times throughout the day.-My clumsy ass has a tiny purse that barely fits the battery, so often enough if I don't take the extra second to stuff it in place it often starts poking out of my bag and has fallen out a few times. There's only one sign of scuffing in the 2 years so far.-I've charged my phone and my friends on the times I play pokemon go so, that's a perk. It does charge noticably slower for obv reasons.-Like my car, I never like to leave my battery under half full. The only time that I tried draining it - it made a good 6-8 full phone cycles (iPhone 6) before the battery depleted.-Texture of it is great, I can't tell if it's cause it's matte but I hate the glossy slippery batteries cause I'm so clumsy.  It's easier to keep a grip on this one.-This battery knows to idle and not let it drain constantly when nothing is plugged in. I've had other batteries that drained regardless.Cons:-after 2 years one of the ports is starting to give out and not charge and I couldn't find any debris in the port. It still charged but it's noticeably slower to the other port.-It will take some time for it to recharge, be patient. (I often charge it at work for 7-8 hours)-It's pretty thick? I own other batteries that are way smaller and lighter than it, but that's not a huge con to me though I may need to get a bigger bag. Unless you're wearing cargo shorts or have big pockets, this probably will fall out of your pocket. If you're a girl a tiny cute purse would barely fit this.- I've brought it camping a few times and I'm not sure if this matters but obv, if there's extreme heat its probably bad for the phone and the battery. On a few occasions my phone has refused to charge, and my battery has refused to power anything until it cooled down.-On my most recent trip internationally, I did get hassled about the battery and it was confiscated.  As I'm planning to go to Hong Kong next year & japan, I'm uneasy about what to do with my backup battery.",Durable and hasn't diminished in performance,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,4410,25,29

I have started to buy a lot of their products from cables, to car chargers, wireless charging pad, and now a Power Bank.Though, when I first purchased this item it did not work for my iPhone XS Max at all. My phone for some odd reason froze up and went completely dark. I unplugged it from the Power Bank and I could not get the display to come back on. I had to do a hard reboot to get the phone to respond. Needless to say I thought it was my phone at first so I tried other cables and I tried to plug it directly into the wall. Other cables used with the Power Bank still froze up my device and I had to repeat the hard reboot. Though, my phone worked plugged directly into a wall with all the cables that I had tried.So, I dreaded the nightmare of having to contact Anker customer support because I have had bad experiences with other companies customer support. It has always been a back and forth game of who is at fault for the reason why it is not working with your device. I was expecting that they would tell me to take my phone to Apple to have them diagnose it or something crazy. Luckily, that was not the case at all! Shelly worked me with me throughout the entire process and she was amazing. Unfortunately, the replacement that they had sent me did not work either and I was not sure what the issue could be. I really wanted to stay with Anker and not go with another product. I travel a lot and it is easier to have a Power Bank for those times when it is needed. They sent me a third replacement and that one worked perfectly! No more issues and I am able to charge both my iPad Pro and iPhone.Thank you to Shelly and Anker customer support for the hard work in getting the issue resolved.",Travel Companion,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,1643261,7,6

Life is not only easier with a cell phone, it’s just plain better. And even as I sit here in the year 2018, there are times when you don’t have an outlet readily available to keep your phone plugging along. That’s where these portable chargers come in so much handy.Heck, there are even times I’m sitting darn near next to an outlet and I use it to charge. Why? Because I have 4 kids running around and a charge cable running across the floor is like some sort of tripwire trap you’d see in a bad Vietnam movie.I’ve had several of these chargers over the years and Anker has been the best of them all. Since these things are just big batteries, you don’t want a cheap one that you have to worry about starting a fire every time you charge it. Anker knows what they are doing, so I have no worries there.I ended up getting this larger unit after dealing with a series of power outages from hurricanes and a bigger battery meant more charges for our phones. I think it’s a good idea for everyone to keep one stowed away for emergency purposes. Bad storm coming? Charge up the pack while you still have power.Anyways, if I haven’t convinced you yet, doubt I’m going to.

While my first charger broke, I now have one that works courtesy of Anker. Thank you to Anker customer service!I purchased this is November 2015.

Both phones say it's not compatible and it's slow charging.  2. After almost 3 years of moderate use, it died! No outgoing power at all.  So if you expect a long-term battery, think again. I have other brands portable batteries that I've used for longer and they still work.Bottom line, it's fine overall, but due to the above mentioned issued, plus the fact that you can't plug in a USB Type-C without an adaptor is unfortunate because you'll need an adaptor to charge most up to date tech.",Anker Customer Service is prompt to fix issues!,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,88099,202,174

I did lots of research online because I wanted a power bank that was safe for my nitendo switch. Every single youtube channel and written articles highly suggest Anker.  I got this particular one because they suggested this precise model. I bought it for a camping trip my family was taking and my 7 year old nephew,6year old niece and 4 year old nephew were coming on the trip and they absolutely love pokemon so I figured I would bring my switch and let's go pikachu to play with the kids for a bit before bed time (they aren't really allowed to play video games but their mom is my sister and she trusts me, so playing pokemon on my switch is a treat. Not to mention it would entertain me on the long drive) we were staying in a Class C motor home with 9 people and where I slept had no plug in so I definitely was happy I brought my ankor power bank. It charges my switch fully with no issue, and had plenty of battery left (I charged my phone 3 times, charged my sisters laptop and my father's phone before it finally was on low battery) it absolutely charges fast and holds tons of battery. It doesn't gt hot, had several charging options, has clear indicator to let you know how much battery life it has left, it came with a charging cable and a nice little case to put it in. I totally love it. The one and only complaint (its not really a complaint) it definitely takes a long time to fully charge it up. It took several hours and at times I just leave it charging over night and still not fully charged in the morning (since it holds so much battery life,it only makes sense that it would take significant time to charge) i suggest making sure to plug it in the morning a day before you need it (if taking it on a trip) if its something you will use everyday, the battery last a long time so just make sure to plug it in when its dead way before you need to use it again. Lights on the ankor battery will turn completely off when it is fully charged. Its simple, works great, and decent price. I absolutely suggest this to anyone and especially to those who are looking for a portable battery for their Nintendo switch because we all know how Nintendo switches can brick from using any type of items on the switch that isn't licensed nintendo and having a portable battery that isn't within the correct voltage for the switch can brick it. If you have any concerns still about using it for a switch, I suggest looking up YouTube videos on it and I promise you that majority of the videos will suggest this power bank.

I probably used it about once a month, so likely charged and used as a charger on 18 different occasions.  It worked, but only at about 1/2 capacity for last 6 mos. So worked well as described for about a year. Then it started only charging to max 2 bars after over 24 hours on a charger. But those two bars would still charge 5-6 devices. So whatever... but now it just stays at one bar and can’t engage charging w any phone. So if $50 seems reasonable for 12 mos of as described usage, then go for it. That’s honestly seems fair.

She said she had arranged for a replacement to be shipped to Ohio. I replied to her about borrowing a cable and so I was no longer in a bind about getting the unit charged up and asked if she could ship the replacement to my home in Colorado instead  if the replacement shipment hadn't yet gone out.  She emailed back that it had already been shipped, but she would send a second replacement to Colorado.  Which she did.  Now I consider that pretty stellar customer service!

I never gave it a shot and threw it away. Anyways, directly before I bought these, I bought two, one from the ol ball n chainsy, and one from me. I had bought a wireless charger for my phone (which was the generic version, yet still costed $5 more than this outstanding piece of art) because I thought ""hey, that's fancy""... but fancy shmancy. I'll let you in on a secret, wireless chargers, STILL HAVE A WIRE. So they should be called stupid round Chargers or Chargers that may seem cool but or just a huge waste of money. I returned this *poopy wired yet at the same time wireless charger*, and went on the hunt for something better, something worth hard earned money. This is, without a doubt the best charger I've ever owned in my life. May it be a wall charger, quick charge charger, a *poot noise*wireless charger*, or any other charger known to man. If you're looking for a great product, at an amazing price, with ridiculous power and hold time, then look no further. I'm actually looking into buying anew anker wall port when I get a bit of ""me money"", because as my wife stated, sparing a couple of nastier phrases, ""there is absolutely, positively no way in hell you're putting that on our baby registry!!"". But I digress, this is seriously the best purchase I've made for my phone since, well, since I bought the phone itself.  I absolutely love it and was flabbergasted when I clicked on a link that stated it was $80, but saw it was only $39.99. I was figuratively beside myself, started to do MAD research, and yet without a doubt, this was the battery for me. I'm now buying strictly anker products, have recommended the anker line of products to basically all of my friends, causing a few to make their own purchases. Thano you guys!

I hope it has a 'learning' controller to be more accurateNow, I knew that I should have been at the end of the last dot. I utilized this with my phone to watch Netflix. Due to the long flight, I wanted to ensure I had zero down time. I charge my phone between 20% to 95% and pulled the charger off, while Netflix was running. Within a 48 hour period, I was able to accomplish 8 hours of Netflix watching for a phone that typically can only handle an hour or two (airplane mode, may have saved some battery life). I also performed GPS mapping across for a two hour drive. Then I managed e-mail for a twelve hour day, then finished the night with another hour of Netflix, at which time, the unit decide to go from two (2) dots to zero (0) dots. (The first two (2) full charges, the unit kept four (4) dots lit as the charge level.) I still rank this more impressive and light weight and an additional plus for that additional amperage output for faster charges or higher end devices.","Light indication is not accurate, but this unit is still awesome!",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,30455420,41,43

It would charge quickly, and I could get 8 phone charges out of it, which was perfect for when I was traveling abroad and my bed wasn't near an outlet. I especially loved that it had the capacity to charge my tablet. I would carry this in my purse all the time and be able to charge my devices and my friend's. It wasn't until just after the 18 month warranty expired that it started to have problems. It now takes the whole night to charge an almost dead phone to 85%. I originally thought it was an issue with the cable, so I purchased an Anker cable as replacement, but unfortunately it still has the same problems with both ports. I also noticed last month that my dual port Anker car charger I bought around the same time also has problems, and one of the ports isn't working. The message I'm getting from the Anker products I've received is that they don't last much longer past the warranty, so just be aware if you're looking for products with longevity. The charger was great when it worked properly, but now it's a pretty lame brick.UPDATE 8/20/18: I reached out to Anker customer service about the problems I've been having with my Anker products and they were quick and kind enough to make an exception to replace my charger despite it being out of warranty. They really do stand behind their products, so I'll continue to support Anker in the future. I am still in the process of testing this new charger out and will update this review further after I've taken it on a few longer trips.UPDATE 2/17/2019: I took this charger for a long trip in October, and at the time I thought it worked fine. I noticed that towards the end of the trip the charging time got slower, and now it takes over 4 hours to get a full charge on my phone. Thinking it might be a cable issue, I purchased a new Anker cable. It had the same slow charging with the new cable, but I later discovered the new cable to also be faulty after testing out a couple other charging cables around the house.

When I first opened the box, I thought I might end up returning it because, though it is certainly portable, it isn't something I would ever throw in a bag to carry around with me. It is too heavy to put in a pocket or in a pocketbook or briefcase, I think (though again, you sure COULD).However (and this is an important ""however""), this monster of a charger charged my iPhone 6 more than FOUR times before I needed to recharge it. That's awesome! I use it at home when my battery is low but I don't want to leave my phone plugged in to the computer. I can carry it from room to room with ease and the phone charges very quickly.Recharging this beast takes a long time, which is perhaps a small drawback (but not enough for me to take away any stars). I had mine plugged in for over 12 hours before it was fully recharged. (You'll know it's done because there are little lights that show you how much of a charge is left in the device.)To recap: I wouldn't use this as a daily back-up that I'd carry around with me.

I noticed that something was funky as my device would want to charge then not want to charge. I ordered a new Anker lightning cable because I figured it was an older cable I was using and that could be the issue, however, I had the same issues with the new cable plus it seemed that the PowerCore powerbank would stop charging the phone or iPad before it was fully charged. Finally, I noticed that I would have to press the charge indicator to get the PowerCore to start charging instead of simply plugging my source USB cable and plugging the device in and it start charging right away.I reached out to customer service to inquire about the peculiar issues I was having and they informed me that my device was indeed defected. They sent the prepaid label to send the old device in and promptly sent the new device which has been working as expected.

I used to keep one end plugged into the battery and the other hanging free from my phone when I needed to use my phone.  The other is I won't charge it unless it's dead. Given there's little risk because Anker will (probably) replace a dead one, I highly recommend it, but still need to dock a star.Update: It's dead.  After a couple months of perfect charging and discharging, I noticed that it started to lose its charge.  A few weeks later and it's now a glorified paperweight as it doesn't hold a charge at all.

The battery capacity is relative to my LG V30's battery is enormous.  That's a plus.The physical size, although not small, isn't too large compared to my phone.  Despite being bigger than my phone, I am able to carry them in my pant's or short's cargo pocket.  The weight, however, is noticable.  It is beyond noticable compared to the phone.  The comparison to my LG phone is my go-by because that's its reason for purchase.  I purchased this Belkin model charger for the specific reason of charging my phone when it's battery was near no power.  I suppose that weight/mass is downfall part of high power capacity in batteries for now.  Understanding that this world is not a perfect world, I'm okay with this trade-off.The charging time does take long but again, like the weight, it is all part of the charger's high capacity.  I usually leave it charging overnight.This model will give me about four full charges to my nearly empty phone battery.  Unfortunately, this is where I give this product a lesser grade.  In my opinion, this model gets straight As in everything except performance.  I wasn't expecting this but I suspect that I was sold a flawed model.  At about the second or third charging cycle to my phone, I discovered that the charger would stop charging before completing the cycle.  To be fair, it's not too big a deal.  Simply unplugging the USB cable from the charger restarts charging.  Additionally, small problem or not, that shouldn't be happening.  I paid a good premium and as such, that glitch shouldn't be occurring.Over all, it's a good and very long lasting charger that uses a good-night's-rest time span to top off.",Great charger but...,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,4834627,2,0

Big enough for all the power-hungry devices in my life especially the work phone at my job site.

I can charge my iPhone 8 and the work phone up from 10 or 20% until full and hold it there for a couple of hours until my shift ends at least 4 to 5 times a week and still have about 10 to 15% of the charge left after my work week is done.

You just need the right cable and wall plug. Like most tech companies, I’ve found that Anker’s own wall plugs and cables (yes even the 12-inch freebie) will get the job done faster whether it’s getting charged or doing the charging. It’s even more evident when using a generic or third party cable and an apple wall plug to charge it for example. When I used a generic cable that came with another device, the charge up took at least 14 hours and it wasn’t charged more than 75% at that point. The 3rd light was still blinking when I had to leave for my next shift. The only real drawback is the pack won’t shut off once the device is done charging especially with an iPhone if you’re prone to forgetting about it or just charging your phone while you sleep.

I’ve yet to do a full stress test on this battery, but I have been able to do a few weekend getaways without draining the battery even half way down.  The one down side to this device is that where it can hold a lot of power, it also takes a while to charge. So if you do plan on running it down, you also need to plan a while to recharge it.Build quality for the battery is solid, and the case/pouch that it comes with does offer some padding, but still something that you will need to pack into your luggage/pack not something you would clip to the outside.So far, I’m impressed not only with this product, but also Anker as a whole. Anker is a newer company only recently celebrating their 5th Anniversary, (founded in 2009) yet in terms of quality I would rank them up there with some of the ‘big dogs’ like Apple, Sony, LG or Samsung.",Overpowered...,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,15729,52,78

I use it for my iPhone, iPad, Nintendo Switch (yes,it works great!), JayBird earphones, etc. It carries a lot of juice which makes it useful so you don't have to constantly keep charging it after one use. Although, because it carries so much charge, it takes several hours to charge but it's worth the wait honestly. Also, it's has some heft to it and the exterior has a very nice texture to it and it also comes with a mesh bag so you can carry the bank around with its charger so if it's every bumped around or something, it won't get scratched keeping your battery bank looking brand new after several uses.

My pack charges completely overnight with the iPad charger. I still have issues with the iPhone wall block but I believe it's because the output simply isn't high enough to charge it once it's completely dead or doesn't charge fully because the output can't match the capacity of the 20100.

Then I went home to my parents and it would only charge sometimes and even then to two lights. Then I came home to my apartment and it charged one time to all four lights and then the next time to two. The second unit charged fully at my apt and then barely is charging at my parents house. I’ve tested it on multiple outlets which doesn’t make any sense. I’ve tested all the outlets with a voltmeter and it’s fine.

It was nicely packed. I decided to test it ( believe it or not to write a 5 star review)I dont know if the power banks I received are defected some how or this is the case with all of them. So, I have a Samsung note 4 android phone. I charged my power-bank to its full capacity and I decided to charge my phone using this powerbank .The power-bank has 4 lights on when it s fully charged. My phone battery Mah is 3220 so I guess I need to be able to charge my phone for 6 times before the power-bank dies. But to my surprise I was able to charge my phone only 5 times ( from 0 to 100%) and as I started the 6th time the power-bank died.So, It has 16100 Mah power not 20100. At-least this one is like that.I got 2 of these powercore and overall I can say I am not satisfied with its quality. Maybe if they said it is 16100 mah it would be ok?Update: Few days after I posted my review, costumer service contacted me and they explained the reason behind why  was not getting 100% of what it was written on the power bank. So, first of all my phone was on all the time when I was charging it so as my phone gets charged it is also losing its power not to mention the powerbank loses some of its power due to heat. So what I was getting from the powerbank was totally reasonable. What I loved more was the way costumer service treated me. Even though I was not being reasonable they offered to replace my powerbank with the larger one in capacity while I did not have to pay the difference.

The battery lasts a couple of days/weeks/don't really know how long, so there's no need to worry that you won't be able to use them after a long time of not using it.Downside: this thing is quite bulky (doesn't fit into small bags, it's about 2-3 inches longer than an iPhone 6s), and a little heavy so it could get a little too much if you're walking and carrying it for a long time. Also, it takes a while to charge it up to full capacity when totally drained.Great for backpackers, long trips where you won't be able to reach an outlet anytime soon. If you're looking for a charger that'll keep you juiced up on the daily commute or something, you may want to consider a smaller size.",Awesome juice pack!,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,966516,50,78

I spent a lot of money purchasing smaller less quality battery packs to find this out.  I have used this for about a month now and it works flawlessly.  One of the best parts about this Anker charger is that it adapts to the item you are charging.  What I mean by that is that I have a Samsung phone and any charger besides the factory charger takes hours to charge the phone.  The Anker battery charges my phone faster than the original wall charger.  The other great thing is that the battery charges my phone up to 8 times on a single charge.  It can charge phones,  tablets,  and any other small electronic device.  It's very sturdy made of a very hard plastic and comes with a nice pouch.  The pouch is ventilated so you can put a phone and the battery into it and charge it in the pouch and it doesn't heat up.  The USB cable that comes with it is also very well made and won't wear out like cheap usb cables.  Finally,  Anker's customer service is top notch.  One of the batteries was defective on arrival and I simply called them up and they overnighted a new one and sent me a packing label to send the old one back.  The item is about the size of a galaxy note 4 but about twice as thick.  I will definitely be buying more products from Anker in the future.",Best Battery I've ever used.,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,78937061,162,230

Tried different cords etc.  Not bashing the brand, but this particular product does not live up to any reasonable expectations.UPDATE.  Well someone at Anker saw my review and asked to replace the battery. They shipped me another without requesting return of the one I reviewed.

So, I purchased this   Anker PowerLine+ USB C to USB 3.0 cable           and tried it out.Short answer: it works.Long answer: when the Switch is in sleep mode, it charges at a normal reasonable rate (still, not as fast as original charger of course), but while playing something intensive like Zelda: BotW, it charges very slowly. The Switch's battery doesn't discharge while plugged into the PowerCore, but it doesn't charge at the rate like when it's docked for example, which is understandably so.Eventually, I'd like to upgrade to a newer Power Delivery equipped external battery to support faster charging to the Switch. Until then, charging in sleep mode or charging slowly while playing will work for me.I'm just surprised this PowerCore is lasting this long.

I used it on several plane rides, at airports, at home, at the beach, at the zoo.. I previously posted a 3 star review stating I had received only 3 months of use before it started acting strangely. After posting that review I was contacted multiple times by the seller who wanted nothing more than to solve the issue. I had tried multiple cords all which didn't seem to help so I assumed it was the battery, as did Anker who offered to replace it under the warranty. Once I returned home, after the three months, I purchased a new charger for my phone which immediately improved the charging rate and am now trying this same cord on the battery. It is very possible the cord that came with the charger is faulty (I KNOW my regular phone charger and back up chargers were all worn out) but it isn't a big deal as I can simply use my phone charger. Bottom line - Anker was right on top of the issue. They promised a new battery under warranty and responded promptly, and courteously, to my review and subsequent emails. I will ALWAYS give my business to a company that takes the time and makes the effort. IF it turns out the battery is the issue I will simply return it but the review stays as is.Note: It IS bulky and heavy.

The first one I bought, broke within a month of buying it and idk how it did. I mostly left it in its box, and it doesn't help how my lazy ass didn't tell the company or write a review about it and now its most likely too late and is pointless to do. I asked friends which to buy and they recommended other brands yet I keep coming back for the less weight and the high capacity. I just got my second portable charger which is this device and so far its heavier than I thought, but i hope it will last longer. What I like so far is that there's 2 lights and a half when I pressed the button, out of the box which is good. I really need this one to last because I'm going on a trip soon which I need it for, and even though there's many other cheap ones that have much more capacity, it either doesn't have high\good reviews, it is very heavy, or both.Just like the saying, with cheap products come cheap quality. I'm kind of sad that I didn't notice that its a USB charger and not a USB-C because I bought cables to go with it but meh, I have other USB cables so I don't mind as much since I'm planing to buy a phone with a USB-C charging port and how everything is slowly switching to USB-C. I know its my fault that I didn't ask for a refund or new one when I could have, and now with my messed up brain think it was a long time ago or at least past the warranty so I doubt I can get a new one, and even though I do ask that if there is someone that reads this, is from Anker I hope something can be worked out or check if the warranty is still available or help me check, since idk how. I wont put too much mind on it since its mostly my fault though adn as I said before just hope this device will last at least a year.

I might come back in a year or 6 months or if anything happens to change this or add on to it as I see others do.(Edit) OMG WOW I thought I wouldn't be coming back in a few months but Anker responded to my problem very quickly and got in touch with me. They told me that I could still get a retry/ new compatible charger if it was still in the 18 month warranty. They sent me a email asking for the serial number and shipping address for clarification and said that they would get me a new one and then check in 7 days to see if its up and running still. I'm both really happy and surprised on how Anker helps their customers, even though I know its for more to trust it and to buy more from it. And it worked, at least for me. I'm planning to buy more in the future from them, yet first clarify that I'm buying the right cables and tech since im not so smart in that compartment.","Second time purchase and second chance, maybe last if time will tell.",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,13285663,14,4

When I got it, I tried to charge my phone and was only able to get it to 80% before the charger stopped charging.  I changed lightning cables to see if that was the issue, but got the same result.  I called Anker and they got back to me quickly, saying they would send me a replacement.I got the second charger and the same thing happened.  I called back and was directed to plug the charging cable back into the USB-port in the charger to reset it.  This did not help and the charger still was unable to charge beyond ~80%.  I contacted Anker and got a response to the effect of ""we hope this fixes your problem and your charger works again"".After this, I became frustrated and attempted to contact Anker again.  I told them I would like my money back, since it seems like there was an inherent problem with the design of the charger.  I was told that the design was changed in December 2018 and that as a consequence, this flaw was seen in a handful of cases.  I was okay with their explanation, but still told them that I would not be comfortable with another replacement and would like my money back.  Instead, they told me because I was beyond the 30 day period where you can return it for a full refund, I would not be able to get the refund.Instead I was offered a newer model of the Powercore, the Powercore II.  At this point, I was very frustrated and had called and emailed Anker numerous times. I decided to stop trying to get my money back and just said I was okay with the new model.Based off of other reviews of this product, it seems to work fine for most people.  With that said, I would recommend to test it out on your phone or device.  If it does not fully charge it, get a refund right away (definitely before 30 days).EDIT:Anker has contacted me and offered me a full refund of my money.

Of course the thing wasn't fully charged straight out of the box, but I took it with me thinking that even just a single phone charge would be better than a dead phone for the whole weekend. I took it, let it charge a bit for an hour using my car charger, and went on my way.Weekend camping trip charge tally?With only two of the four indicator lights on the PowerCore charger it managed:-3 charges from less than 20% to full on an iPhone 6S-2 charges from from less than 20% to full on an iPhone 7 Plus-1 partial charge from less than 20% to ~50% on an iPhone 8 Plus-1 charge of a Bose SoundLink MiniUnderstandably the numbers might seem inflated since the iPhone 6s has small battery capacity - but the fact is it managed to keep my phone and multiple others from dying on a weekend trip, especially cool considering the PowerCore was probably only about 50% charged! I do really like this product and feel like out of the other no-name portable power banks I've used before, Anker's product seems to be the real deal. I have no questions of whether the 20k mAh rating is legit. I have no qualms about the speed of the charging (it is definitely very speedy indeed). Anker backs their brand with the quality they put out and I am happy to be able to rely on their stuff.Cheers to Anker - now make some sort of mosquito-repelling device and I'm sure my next camping trip will be sponsored by your stuff!","Charges everything under the sun, doesn't catch fish for you...",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,261026,10,5

We left our various hotels between 5:30 & 8:30 AM everyday and settled into our room around 9:30 PM (give or take an hour) each night.My daughter and I used our phones consistently for listening to music, watched movies, and played games on the bus rides; took a lot of pictures/video throughout the day; to help us with translation, and calls/text messages to family in the States (average 30 minutes in length).The battery did a great job recharging our phones even when two phones were plugged in at once. Because we were using our phones so much, It was common to recharge it 4-5x’s a day each. Out of 4 blue lights that indicate the charge level only once did it get to level 1 (hotel lost power & I couldn’t recharge it once); the rest of the time it stayed at a 3 or 4. It took two nights to get it fully charged again but even on level one it got us from 2:30 PM until I plugged it in at 9 PM.The battery is a little heavy and too big to carry in your pants pocket comfortably. However, it’s not so heavy that it could not be comfortably carried in a backpack or purse. I just stuck it in a hidden pocket in my backpack and when I needed to charge, I just pulled my lightening cord through a small opening.This battery was so much better than smaller batteries I used on a trip to NY, NY last year. My smaller batteries usually didn’t last the day and I had to limit my phone use. I would highly recommend this battery. I will never travel without it again.

There are some places where a cell phone or other electronic device works or doesn't, but you never want to be discharged with no batteries or backup.  An older one I carried was around 650mAh which is small by comparison, and maybe would charge an older flip phone once.I have been testing this and so far so good.  the capacity is over 2Ah, which is plenty for even the most power-hungry laptop or ipad.  For what I need, I'm looking for something that would recharge a phone (I have a Samsung S7 edge).  My starting conditions were a fully charged Anker Power Core 20100, and my cell phone.  I don't plan on having my cellphone on the entire trip, but under circumstances of having the phone on all day discharged the phone to around 60 to 70 percent (data services off).  I then recharge the hone at the end of the day -- the Anker takes about an hour or two to fully recharge the phone.  So far it will recharge my cell phone 7 or 8 times before the Anker itself needs recharging.I've noticed for more power hungry items like GPS handlhelds, ipads, etc., the Anker will recharge your device maybe once or twice.  But for the convenience of keeping a cell phone in good charge for over a week, I'd say it performs up to expectations.  For longer term recharging, I would recommend the Anker solar recharger (to recharge the Anker PowerCore) but that will be the subject of another review.",Performs up to expectations.,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,3210779,21,48

I use the charger at work, at home, and especially when I travel (I travel frequently).  I've been using this PowerCore for about 11months and about 2 months ago the LED lights that indicate how much charge it has left started to act funny.  When the powerCore is fully charged all LED's would light up but once I use it to charge my phone a couple times the outer LED lights go out and the middle two stay on.  With the two middle LED's on the powerCore worked fine but after another couple charges the lights would go out but still charge my phone.

Now to continue, On Ankers Website it was easy to find the Customer Support Phone number and once I called, it was easy to navigate which department I wanted to talk to.  I talked to Adam at Anker's customer support department, he was courteous and professional and was eager to help resolve my issue with the powerCore. (It is very hard to find good customer support these days)  After I explained to Adam about my issue with the product he found out that the batch of powerCore charger that I had purchased on amazon 11 months ago had a defects in them and was taken off amazon's shelf.  He told me due to my powerCore being part of that defective batch Anker would be sending me a brand new powerCore minus the defect and I was able to keep the current Charger.  I have to say that I am very impressed with Anker and their customer service.  I believe that Anker stands by their product and if any issues arise that is not fault of the purchaser they make it right.

No, really. I'm serious.If you don't own something from Anker, I don't understand you. Alright, that's a little harsh, but it makes my point. This company comes out of nowhere and starts making these ""cheap electronics"" that turn out not to be cheap at all.In price, sure, I consider it cheap. If you don't think $40 is cheap to be able to power your phone, tablet, Macbook (yep, I said it) and even one of those weird electronic cigarette things for a full day away from the socket, then you're actually the one who is cheap. But this charger, and every other thing I own from Anker, is far from cheap.I'm not kidding. Here's how I use my PowerCore 20100, pretty much daily:I pull it off charge in the morning and throw it in my backpack. During coffee, I charge my motorized panning head for time lapse photography. Then it powers my GoPro Hero5 Session while doing said time lapse for well over an hour. By that time, my phone needs topping up. After lunch during edits, my Macbook is usually running low, so I plug it in to this thing and charge up while editing. I'll usually give my phone another boost in the evenings and typically finish with one out of four ""dots"" left. I also charge my GoPro once more at some point during the day.What more could you ask for in a battery pack this small? Nothing. Nothing is your answer.

It works best when your battery is fully charged, in order to keep it from going down, instead of necessarily charging up a dead phone. It will still charge your dead phone, just not very fast.Comes with a nice drawstring bag for storage The four lights keep track of the battery charge and are easy to see. There is a button on the side for turning it on and off. Now that I've gotten used to having the extended battery life, I've found it quite helpful even without running very draining apps like PoGo.

I expected a better quality in an Anker product.Update - I contacted Anker as the charger is still under their 18 month warranty, with the primary complaint being that the charger will not fully charge and fully discharges before charging either my Kindle Fire or LG G4 phone completely. Their response was to FULLY CHARGE THE ANKER CHARGER and then see how many times it will recharge my LG G4!!! SERIOUSLY?! My complaint is that it will not FULLY charge and they request that I FULLY charge it!Update 2 - After a short exchange of emails, Anker is sending me a new charger, without any of the normal RMA hassles you usually see with most electronic companies.

It appears that the game uses about 1,000 mAh per hour.  Nevertheless 5 stars for the device.Pros:- It fits in a guy's back pocket.  About an inch sticks out, but it still feels secure.  Belt is recommended - the battery is heavy enough to pull down sweatpants.- It fits well in a water bottle pocket on the side of a backpack.- The USB cable that comes with the battery is long enough to reach from the back pocket or from the backpack to the phone in your hand.  The cable works for Android devices and for charging the battery, iPhone cable is not included.- Remaining charge indicator is simple, but sufficient.Cons:- Does not come with a power adapter.- Does not do ""fast charge"" on Galaxy S7.- The bag that comes with the battery feels slippery and I could not find a use for it.","Good battery, too large for Pokemon Go",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,15,3

They sent me a brand new power bank and a prepaid shipping label to return the defective one. Overall, the return process was quick and painless!As for the power bank itself, it has been about a month since I've received the new one, and so far it has been working perfectly! I just got back from a short roadtrip out of town with a large group of friends. With this many people, wall outlets were scarce, so I brought this power bank with me. I was able to charge my phone from ~20% to 100% charge overnight for all 4 nights! Absolutely worth it.Original review:The charge capacity is fantastic, and traveling with it makes me feel extremely secure that I won't be found dead with a dead phone. The biggest problem I've experienced is that one of the USB charging ports seems to be defective (specifically, the port in the middle). Sometimes it'll charge, but oftentimes it won't. The other port is perfectly fine, and typically I only use it to charge one thing (my phone) anyway, so I'm not too heavily impacted by it.

When plugging my devices into the USB slot, they do NOT automatically start charging as it is claimed to do. Aside from the battery's capacity, having the auto-charging function was important for me when carrying the battery pack daily in my backpack as a means to charge my phone during my commutes. Instead of it charging automatically, I need to plug the phone in and then hit the side button to activate charging. Not a big deal, but i do have to dig around in my backpack to do so. The second problem is that when my iPhone 5 is fully charged, it does not know to shut off and the lights stay on and continue providing a current. I figured this would provide trickle charging, but after two nights on a fully charged battery pack, the battery meter shows a drop to 1 to 2 dots out of 4 on the battery meter. I called Anker, and they said this was unusual and offered to replace them or offered a 50% refund and voiding the warranty. I thought that was fair. If I got one that functioned as it should, I would not hesitate to give this 5 stars. I would also gladly purchase again from Anker. :)***UPDATE: Feb 23, 2016***I have since received exceptional customer service and follow up from Ida at Anker in getting me out a replacement for one of my two 20100mah PowerCore Anker chargers.

Now if it lasts at least up to the 18 months then this product deserves a 5 star rating. I bought this charger to replace a Justin (brand) charger I purchased at Kohls. It was a 10000mAh unit I believe. When I got it I fully charged it as well before using it. At full charge it showed 99% charged. I guess the manufacturer was to cheap to add another digit to the display. It did not fully charge my iPhone or iPad. At most it charged it only to the 90-92% level. And when the unit showed 65% charge left on it, it would not charge anything anymore it had to be recharged. The Anker unit has 4 led's to indicate its charge level and when it is fully charged it turns off automatically to avoid overcharging whereas the Justin charge didn't. And when it needs to be recharged one led is on and it blinks. This unit fully recharges my devices unlike the Justin.",Works as advertised so far.,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,15,12

Two quick tips though:1) While this device puts out enough power for rapid charging, some chargers can't support it. Make sure to get a charger/cable that will!2) It has two ports! Use them both simultaneously for max charging efficiency.","Fast charging, huge capacity. Great for recharging your drone batteries (or anything else) on the go!",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,23,9

I have bought several Anker products over the years, and I have to say they make quality stuff. There hasn't been any battery deterioration or issues with the battery.- DESIGN: this battery is on the heftier side, but it makes sense considering the capacity of the battery. it is sleek and functional, and easy to carry with you. The mesh carrying case it comes with helps to cushion it from other things carried with it (other objects in a bag or backpack, pocket, etc).- BATTERY: I bought this battery during a black Friday sale, so the price for the amount of battery was a great deal. I wanted a large capacity battery that could charge my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet completely (tablet has a 9,500 mAh) and the Anker powerCore delivered. It is able to charge my tablet and my phone completely with some juice left, or charge my tablet twice, or my phone at least 5 times fully. I am able to charge my devices quickly and while I am using them.- DURABILITY: I have dropped this thing so many times and from various heights, that I am surprised it hasn't dented or stopped working all together. now I am not say be reckless with it, I am just saying that it will most likely withstand some accidental drops and bumps.- CHARGE TIME: depending on what type and speed the charger you are using to charge the PowerCore with, the average charge time is  between 10-14 hours. If using a slow charger, it could take over 20 hours. I usually let it charge overnight while I sleep, and it it good to go in the morning.- FINAL THOUGHTS: It is an excellent product, I highly recommend this portable battery. I can't tell you how many times I have lent it out to my friends and family so they could charge their devices. It comes in handy on long trips and is generally a good thing to carry around. I have used it as a flashlight by attaching a USB powered LED light, powered a USB fan, and many other USB powered things. The uses are innumerable.","Over a year, and still going strong",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,5,0

It's somewhat durable after having used over a year.Dropped it a couple a times. Once on a cement road and it got scratched but still worked fine.

It shipped quickly and the box it arrived in was very premium-looking. It was one of those cool laminated cardboard kinds where you fold out some flaps to get to the product rather than struggling with plastic and tape. The contents were a small and pretty simple manual, a short micro USB cable, and the battery itself. The battery is a sleek matte black in a sturdy seeming plastic case. It's a bit heavy, but that's what you're gonna get with a battery of this size. It has 4 LED indicators telling you the charge and it arrived at 75%. This battery itself is great! It lasts several days and charges several devices very quickly. I have an LG G3 and it was charged in record time!I would like to issue one warning however. You know how when you have a cheap charging cable, and after some time it only charges when you jiggle your phone just right? Well, the cable that came with it was like that right out of the box! Of course I just grabbed another one and used it, but I was disappointed to see that shoddy quality in an Anker product.I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the cable, but other than that.

Originally, I had purchased it for Pokemon GO, but then realized how much more useful it was as I do not have to worry about going out at night to bars or clubs and having my phone die in case of an emergency, which has happened before. Furthermore, having the two USB plug-ins allow my mom and sister to charge their phones as well and I can go about 2-3 days, playing Pokemon GO all day plus several other tabs open on my iPhone 5S such as Spotify and social media, and forget charging the bank for a few days before it dies. However, a word of caution would be to always plug it into the wall specifically EVERY night to keep it well charged and although it is barely the size of my iPhone 5S, it is a tad heavy for keeping in your pockets; besides those and being careful not to drop it or get it wet, it was well worth the price and has allowed me to keep my phone around 100% charge while showing a charge rate of about 1~3% per minute depending on my settings and usage. I'd definitely recommend it as I already have done so and I would say the description is fairly accurate when it says it can charge an iPhone 5S/6S at least 7x~7.5x before needing to recharge the bank. If anyone else is hesitant or has questions, I can assure as a satisfied customer as I have been using mine nonstop for the past month and no problems yet despite the beating it has taken with me.",Where has this been all of my life?,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,3,0

The other port worked fine through about October/November of 2017, right at the end of the warranty (it's how they get you!).  I was still using the PowerCore, but less frequently, since even while plugged in and ""charging"" my phone did not take a charge from it. I tried different cords and wall outlets to charge the PowerCore, and different cords to charge my phone with the PowerCore, and none worked, though my phone charged fine with these cords using a wall charger. I finally decided to give up on the first one working as well as it had in the past, and purchased a second one today. Aside from the inconsistent port and the PowerCore no longer giving a charge after 19-20 months, the PowerCore worked really well when it did (and I know a few other people who purchased this battery and it's still running great).

It is AWESOME!  Full speed charging of my electronic devices and I can charge two simultaneously.  Packaging was simple and neat, a place for everything and everything in it's place.  Unpacked the Powercore and charging cable, plugged it in to my Anker Power Port 2 and immediately, the LED status lights showed that the PowerCore was half charged already.  Charging was completed and then tested by plugging my iPad and iPhone into it.  Charging the two devices appeared to be full speed equivalent to a wall charger...and there was power left in the PowerCore for more!  I love this thing!  I am using it when I travel and NEVER worry about my phone or iPad running out of power.  Realize that with such a large power reserve, it does take some time to fully charge the PowerCore.

But that is just normal when taking into consideration the capacity of the battery. I love the sleek design of the battery and anker provides a storage pouch too in the package. I have been monitoring the output voltage/current of the portable battery with a digital multimeter and its just perfect. 1A rated devices just pull the exact 5V/1A from the battery and 2A rated devices pull exactly 5V/2A. So its pretty sure your devices are safe charging with this battery. Altogether I am highly satisfied with this portable battery in my last one week of use.

We would frequently charge 4 phones per day (Samsung S7, S4, Apple 6S and 4), and this thing would still have about 75% juice remaining - so easily charged our 4 phones over the course of two full days of travel (without having to recharge the Anker). The lowest charge I ever allowed the Anker to get to was 25% - and when I plugged it in that evening it was fully charged by morning.

It fits inside my husband's pockets (most of the time) or inside a purse (unless it's a very small bag or clutch). The weight is fairly substantial, but that is to be expected for a portable battery pack. Just worth noting if you'll be carrying it around in your pocket/purse. We've occasionally charged BOTH our Samsung Galaxy S6's at the same time, and we get multiple charges out of it. There have been times we've used it for nearly 4 full charges and it hadn't drained the Anker's battery by much. It promises 5 full charges for the S6, but you might be able to wiggle more, just don't quote me on that. The speed it charges at is nearly comparable to the ""fast charge"" our phones get with the wall charger.

I read books on my Kindle HD during slow times and during the evening hours.  I use my smartphone heavily for GPS mapping, email, texting, communicating with the hunting party during the day.  I got tired of my phone and/or Kindle going dead so I decide to give this a try.  Amazingly, I was able to keep my phone and Kindle at adequate charge all week long without having to recharge the unit.  There was still one dot left of charge when I packed it up to leave.  It charges the devices blazing fast.  Much quicker even than my wall socket adapters (whatever I manage to scratched up in the house) that I typically use.  This unit will be a permanent resident of my hunting backpack.  It is quite big and a little heavy, but that makes sense given the charge time you get out of it.  It reminds me of a small laptop battery.  Oh, and the last few days of my trip the temps were around freezing and it still functioned very well.  I was worried it would be much less effective in lower temps.The only minor con I've found is that it does take a long time to recharge.  I'm perfectly OK with that though, given how well it functions when it is charged. I just got it so I can't speak for how well it will hold up over time.

As soon as I started using it to keep my iPhone alive, everyone was lining up to borrow some power! I didn't keep perfect track, but it charged about half a dozen iPhones to full on the first night going from 100% to 75% charge. I'm sure several of those charges were not going from dead to fully charged (or we would have exceeded the manufacturer's specifications several times over!) but I can say one thing - it charged them FAST.The device is also quite durable, I accidentally dropped it several feet onto a concrete floor and it survived with just a nick on the finish. The device was inside the protective bag that it ships with at the time, but I will probably purchase something a bit sturdier to protect it in the future.Awesome product, I recommend it wholeheartedly.","Excellent Purchase - Durable, Quick Charging, High Capacity",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,14,25

It can give your phone probably six or seven charges before you need to recharge the anker. It's portable enough to fit in your pocket, and it's a monster. The only thing I can see as a drawback is it takes a long time to fully recharge your anker, probably three to five hours, I haven't timed it but it seemed like that long (the last blue light was flashing and it stopped charging my phone, so I knew I needed to charge it)But I can fit the battery in one pocket, and my phone in another and charge my phone while I'm away from an outlet, the IQ sense of Anker makes sure your phone (regardless of what it is) charges at its full speed. But I also made an amazing friend partly due to an Anker 20000 charger and Pokemon Go, so technically, this battery could change your life!

My previous anker had a proprietary charger that was a tiny circular plug. I left it at a hotel I was at and was forced to use the cigarrette lighter adapter so after that I knew I had to replace it.

After posting my original review, company representatives reached out to me and arranged to replace the battery pack and even refunded my money for the cost of buying a wall adapter. The new battery pack gets warm but not hot like the first one. Its a great pack and can charge my cell phone all week on a full charge. Anker representatives have been very helpful and proactive in helping fix the issue.  The battery is great, but the company is more so. Once they found out I had trouble getting in touch with them they were very apologetic and worked really hard to put it right. More than the product itself that alone has got them a customer for life.Its a decent enough charger. Heavier than I would have liked but it does the job alright. My main complaint with it is that it doesn't come with a wall charger. Instead it just comes with a usb cable, and you are left to find your own. When I use the wall plug that came with my cell phone the wall unit gets dangerously hot, the unit itself also gets very warm. Being concerned about the risk of fire I decided to buy an Anker brand usb wall charger thinking it would be better since it was the same brand. That also became quite hot (although not as hot as my cell phone charger) The only way to not have it heat up while charging is to use the usb connection on my computer- which is fine when I'm home but useless if I am traveling without my laptop.My other issue is when I tried to contact Anker about this and inquire after safer ways to charge it I received no response from them.  This does not engender much faith in the company when they can't be willing to address such customer concerns.",Great product- super customer service.,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,,

I had a 10,000 mAh external charger but I decided to go with the Anker 20100 and I definitely do not regret it. It has a 4.8A charge speed on both ports which is ridiculous! I rarely see any chargers that allow both ports to be 4.8A speeds. Normally they are either 2A or 1A. Also, this charges my phone at about 1% per minute which is pretty damn fast for an external charger.

That's the bottom line with this charger.  It was charging my galaxy s4 to full multiple times,  approximately five,  even once while the device was on and in heavy use,  before I needed top charge it again.  I play ingress and I need to keep my device charged and ready to fight back if the other team is after my locations.  This battery pack facilitates that and more.I did not detract from the rating for this because anker contacted me directly abs this was intentional in their concept of selling this battery,  but the charger does not come with its own charging block.  It was designed to work with your phone charger. If you are using an older charger expect the charge to take over 24 hours. Anker does offer chargers but sells them separately.  My adaptive fast charger works great for this now that I upgraded to a note 4.","intelligent battery, bring a charger!",Color: WhiteVerified Purchase,,,,

I wanted a battery that would charge up my iPad Air **while I was using the iPad**.  Recently I was in Court with no access to a plug, and a stone-dead iPad Air (hadn't charged it in a couple of months).  This battery began charging the dead iPad Air such that I could use the iPad after a couple of minutes, and while I was using the iPad, the iPad continued charging and increasing the charge level.  Three hours later when it was time to leave, the iPad was at about 60% charge and continuing to charge.  The battery was at three dots.  This appears to indicate that this battery will keep an iPad Air going all day and more, especially if the iPad Air is initially charged.  That's what I was looking for, so I am pleased with this unit.  Other batteries that I have tried would not keep charging the iPad Air *while I was using it* -- they would charge it if it were turned off.  On a plane or in uncomfortable venues such as Court, where plugs are not available, this battery can be a lifesaver because it will charge the iPad Air while you are actively using the iPad Air.

I have absolutely no clue how many iPhones this thing can charge because it's never been low enough to gauge that stat.  I primarily bought this thing for long motorcycle rides.  I have a bag that is attached just below the headlight and I keep the battery pack in the bag and ran a 3' nylon-braided Apple cord to the handlebar mount where my phone rests.  This thing pushes juice to the phone so much that it not only keeps it from draining the battery, but charges it at the same time.  To be clear, I have an iPhone 6 with the screen on full brightness, and a GPS app routing my ride, and heavens knows what other apps might be tracking me and/or pushing data.  And with all of those things going on, my phone is GAINING battery power!  I may have to buy another one of these things because my wife has taken to stealing this thing when she goes out with the girls and whatnot, LoL! I also love that it has two ports for charging two phones as my wife did take this on an overnight trip and she and her friend both kept their phones in near full charge the whole night.  A word of note: this battery pack is not über portable; it's larger than you might be expecting.  I also have two other Anker portable chargers and they are truly portable as they aren't much larger than a roll of nickels, but they don't have a huge capacity for power.  This thing will power your phone for what seems like an endless amount, but again, it is quite large for something called ""portable"".  The smaller Anker charger I own can easily slip inside a jacket pocket or even a large jean pocket.  This thing?  No way, not even close.  A woman purse?  Yes, it would fit in there.  Again, not a deal breaker by any means, just know that it is quite large for ""portable"".  Again, I highly recommend this (and all Anker products really) and suggest you buy this if it sounds like it fits your needs.",Best portable charger I have ever owned, not SO portable...,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,

I bought this primarily for power outages to keep my iPhone 6 charged since I use it a lot. On electricity, my iPhone charges from 20% to 100% in about 75 minutes. Same for my car charger (car charger actually faster). I did not expect the power pack to perform at that level but am disappointed with how long it does take. When the power pack is fully charged it will charge my phone from 20% to 80% in about 2 hours. If I really want a 100% charge it takes 6-8 hours. The last 20% is extremely slow. I read reviews and saw some people felt the cord to the phone could be an issue. I was using the original iPhone cord but bought the Anker lightening charge cord separately in case it mattered. Same performance. Now I will say that a charge from 20% to 80% only reduces the charger power by one blinking indicator, so I will get several 80% charges from a fully charged charger. I am not sending it back because I see reviews from many people having similar issues so odds are good this would happen again.  80% in a power outage can still be quite a blessing - especially when it is several 80% charges. But it does not live up to its billing and the price here is not inconsequential, so I am giving this a mid-rating in the hope of encouraging people to consider alternatives.","Only ""Middling"" Performance",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,,

The first test consisted of charging and timing my iPhone 6S Plus with Apple's wall charger. The charge lasted for 19 hours and 22 minutes until the iPhone battery reached 2%.Next, I charged and timed the iPhone 6S Plus with the Anker Compact 20000mAh battery pack. The results were surprising.I was able to charge the iPhone 6S Plus 19 minutes faster than Apple's wall plug, using the Anker 20000mAh battery pack and the charge lasted for 20 hours and 2 minutes until the battery reached 2%. My opinion of the Anker 20000mAh battery pack was great, but I wasn't done.My next test was the Apple Watch. I repeated the same test by timing Apple's wall charger, then the Anker 20000mAh battery pack. The Apple Watch was finished charging 27 minutes faster and the Watch battery life lasted about the same amount of time as the wall charge. The Anker 20000mAh battery pack still had 4 blue LED's after these tests. So far so great.., but you guessed it, I still wasn't done..I performed a different test but the same general concept. I charged the iPhone 6S Plus and the Apple Watch simultaneously, using the Anker 20000mAh battery pack. As I expected, the Apple Watch finished first and I was happy to see once it reached 100% the Anker 20000mAh battery pack stopped charging in the specific port the Apple Watch was plugged into, but I didn't remove it from the battery pack. The iPhone 6S Plus continued charging and once it finally completed its charge it was still a faster charge than the Apple wall plugs. Apple Watch finished 11 minutes faster and the iPhone 6S Plus finished 3 minutes faster then Apple's wall plugs.Yes, I still had one test left. I charged my iPad 3 and the iPhone 6S Plus simultaneously. The results were as I expected based on the two previous tests. The iPhone 6S Plus finished first and stopped charging but I didn't unplug it from its port. The iPad 3 continued charging. Once it finished charging the timing of each charge was comparable to them both charging on their separate wall chargers. The Anker 20000mAh battery still showed 1 LED left.I put the Anker 20000mAh battery pack through its paces and it exceeded my expectation on every test, so far. I haven't owned the Anker 20000mAh battery pack long enough to test its charging longevity or if it decreases over time. If I experience any drastic changes in charging my devices, I will amend this review to reflect the results of my continued testing.At this point, I'm impressed with the test I've performed and would recommend it to anyone wanting a battery pack that holds a charge as well as delivers one. If this changes I'll let you know.. For now, it's my opinion, the Anker 20000mAh battery pack is a solid product.","iPhone 6S Plus, Apple Watch, IPad 3..No problem!",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,,

I have been ever since I bought my first 13000mAh charger. Not trying to sound like a commercial but their products just work, and the 1 time I ever had an issue emailed them they sent me a brand new unit, didn't want me to send the old unit in for repair then wait for the fixed broken unit to come back truly hassle free. Now to review this PowerCore 20100 first thing I noticed is its almost the same exact size as my 13000. Next I noticed the flat black color as opposed to the glossy finish of my old product I have OCD so finger prints is an issue for me. Out the box I took it out on the road didn't charge it at all(I forgot to charge my iPhont 6s plus and my Apple Watch) plugged both in and got a full charge on both devices in no time at all. And the 20100 still has more juice. I have learned to trust Anker over the past year that I have been dealing with them. Didn't understand why there was a need for a 20100mAh when there is a 13000mAh (which didn't have enough power for my iPad, iPhone, & Apple Watch for a weekend at Disney) and a 26800mAh but 20100mAh is more than enough to do the job.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.",Not trying to sound like a commercial but their products just work,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,,

My main use for the portable charger is topping off my phone and tablet (at the same time) at work, and in the car on long drives where I use my phone as a GPS.The cellphone I'm currently using is an LG G3, which has a 3000 mAh battery which is in excellent condition. The Anker Battery pack has a stated capacity of 20,000 mAh, which I have tested to be extremely accurate. As a test one week, I charged the Anker battery to full capacity (four solid blue lights) and waited for my phone to get to below at least 10% before plugging it in each time, each day. I was able to fully charge my phone 6 times, plus charge my tablet another 32% (which has a 6000 mah battery). This is a fantastic result that gives me a lot of flexibility, especially if the power goes out in the house.Pros:- Accurate and long lasting battery capacity.- Has two ""IQ"" USB ports which detect the amperage needed for the device up to 2.4 amps each port.

I've bought several large capacity batteries recently for my MS Surface 3 (non-pro). While several of them have been equal or greater in advertised capacity, in testing they have faiIed to deliver anything close to the advertised capacity or full 2.4 amp charging rate. Additionally the built quality on all of them have been poor to middling. This unit is very solid, with no flex or poorly aligned seams. The case itself is a ""soft touch"" that is comfortable to hold and still nice to look at. It is about as heavy as a battery of this capacity should be, though I haven't weighted it, ""Light weight"" is not a description that fits. That being said, it's equal or lighter than the other 3 I've tried.I had a 5 hour flight recently, and spent the whole time playing ""Grim Dawn"" which pushes my Surface to it's limit power wise. Additionally my girlfriend in the seat next to me was watching movies on her Galaxy Tab 7. When we landed, this thing still had 2 bars on it, and that was the defective one.The original pack I purchased wouldn't finish charging, I left it plugged in for a couple days and it still wouldn't register as ""Full"". Anker support responded to my support request in under 12 hours, and replaced the defective unit promptly and politely. In a world of high technology, things will go wrong, even Apple makes a bad iPhone every now and then. The important thing is what the company does when something does go wrong. Anker support is as good as their product are. Buy this.PS, If you think I got paid for this review, just go look at how crappy most of my other reviews are, and realize I like this product enough to write more than 2 sentences about it.","Amazing battery, even more amazing support. Buy this one, it's worth the money.",Color: WhiteVerified Purchase,,,,

I tend to use them when travelling on airplanes, charging during the flight. The one I replaced seemed to only do one full charge of an HTC 10. That's great for a late night last minute recharge, not great for all day usage.So I bought this power behemoth at a great price. But I neglected to do one thing - check out how much it weighed. 12oz is more than you'd think if you already have a stuffed travel bag. Granted I don't really think it's a deal breaker - and hey maybe I would have still bought it anyways - but I would have reconsidered the 10000 size instead of seeing big charging numbers and blindly buying the bigger one.Having said that, this sucker holds a lot of charge. I haven't drained it yet but I can see this easily charging two phones and a tablet on a transoceanic flight. Odds are I'll just toss two 3000s in my bag for short trips, and only use this on long hauls.In summary, be careful what you wish for. :)",Unlimited power... but a little heavy.,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,,

The others were a PowerCore 10000 and 13000. My experience with Anker has always been positive. The 10k and 13k provided my devices with quick charges and I always felt that they underestimated their recharge numbers. I often found it possible to squeeze out an extra .25 or .5 of a charge on top of what they advertised.The 20000 unfortunately let me down. The packaging itself is the usual Anker standard, clean and compact. The battery itself has a matte textured finish which is good for grip. It's about the size of a medium tv remote and has that quality feeling heft to it. It also came with the standard 1/2 charge out the box. I plugged it into my wall charger before going to bed. I figured an 8 hr charge would top it off and I'd be set for the next day in case I stayed out after work. After I plugged it in, the blinky LED light went on to indicate the charge. Imagine my disappointment the next morning when I woke up to find that it was still blinking and still at the 2/4 dots! I am waiting to hear back from Amazon about exchanging this battery for a different unit. Maybe I got a defective one?******edit 11/24/17*****Anker reached out to me and offered to send me a replacement battery. I received the replacement within a few days and it works perfectly!

My wife and I love camping, and when I saw this pack on sale at Amazon for $40 I didn't even think twice. The pack has a combined output over 2 USB ports of 4.8A, which means two tablets can simultaneously charge quickly on it. I tested the pack with my Galaxy Note 4 and Nexus 9, and depending on the device, seems to charge at a rate of about 22-32mAh/min. My nexus 9 (with a battery size of 6700mAh) would charge about 4% every 10 minutes, and my Note 4 (3220mAh) would charge about 10% in 10 minutes. Very happy with the pack. I was also very pleased with the size. I have a much older 12000mAh Teknmotion powermotion battery pack that is HUGE...about 4"" x 6.3"" x .7"". The Anker is about twice the charge at 20,000mAh, and is half as wide, same height, and barely thicker, not to mention WAY more aesthetically pleasing.NOTE: As I pulled out my old battery pack to measure it for the review, I found I had been hoodwinked. The powermotion 12000 (advertised on Amazon as a 12,000mAh pack) actually only has a 6,000mAh battery. Which explains so much now. So basically this new Anker pack is 3x the charge, and still smaller. I'm now even more impressed with the Anker pack!The pack also comes with a little instruction booklet, a relatively short micro USB cable, and a nice soft mesh carry bag. Very nice packaging, great product design, and a killer price made this an absolute no brainer.",So charge. Much wow.,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,,

So far, on a full charge, it's been able to charge my Samsung Galaxy S5 from as low as 5% to 100% in roughly 1 hour as long as I'm not using my phone for the game, and if I am, then it saves my battery from depleting significantly and can charge it at a rate of about 1% per 10 min. I've charged my phone a total of at least 4 - 5 times with it and the pack still says it has 50% charge left in it, so if I ever go on a Pokemon spree longer than a day, I'm sure this thing will handle it with ease and last the whole time.It does take a while to charge the pack itself, but if you leave it overnight, it should be at full capacity by morning.The only drawbacks I can find so far is that it's slightly heavy, so while it does fit in your pocket, it could pull your pants/shorts down! xDThat, and it does get the wall adapter you use to charge it (In this case my phone charger) REALLY HOT, but that's not too big a deal. (Roughly as hot as a microwavable frozen meal after it's just finished cooking)Outside of Pokemon, it definitely is nice to be able to charge my phone when I'm nowhere near an outlet in class or just walking around while at work. I'd definitely take it (With a full charge) on a several day long camping trip to keep my phone alive for emergencies/flashlight apps and such, and I'm sure it'd be great for it!But-!

The previous two were an AmazonBasics 10000mAh that crapped out and stopped holding a charge six months after purchase and a 13000mAh Limeade that was around five years old and no longer holding a charge. So I was the proud owner of two smallish black bricks and out of options for portable charging—I’m a student and outlets aren’t always plentiful on campus.So I did a little research, and came to the conclusion that this Anker charger would be sufficient for what I need. On one full charge of the Anker portable charger, I charged my iPhone 7 to 100% at least 6 times. To reach 100% from 10%, it took around thirty minutes. This thing is an absolute beast. If you’re looking for a solid portable charger that isn’t enormous, this is the one.Edit: Almost a year later and this thing saves my skin daily, on campus or not. I bring this beast everywhere. It does take a few hours to charge the actual unit itself fully (it did even when first purchased), but hoo boy is the wait worth it. I can fully charge my phone a few times over a few days with this bad dog. Totally impressed, still.",Look no further!,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,,

You can charge a tablet and a phone at the same time as there are two USB ports. I will  note that it has NO wall charger with it.

Anyway, we do a lot of touring over long distances on the HOG, and use Google Maps for navigation, which sucks up a ton of cellular battery. This will be used primarily for keeping us charged and en route. It was easy to use right out of the box, and arrived with a 50% charge. It works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note S5 which is what I will be using for navigation.  As a sidenote, it does NOT work with my Motorola Xoom tablet... when plugged in I get an error message to the effect that the Xoom doesn't support USB chargers.  No matter... I didn't buy it to charge my Xoom which apparently has a proprietary configuration.

Running out of power when away from an outlet can be a disaster. I never travel without this charger, which charges my iPhone to full power about 6 times before it needs recharging itself, which takes 6 to 8 hours and I typically do overnight. I've lost phone power at the worst times--once when I was trying to get an UBER and my phone died--all because I didn't predict how long I'd be away from an outlet. Modern devices and apps can drain your phone or iPad fast, especially when they get older. This device solves all of those problems for me and saved me from having to get a new phone this year. Anker has a great reputation and an excellent warranty. I first bought one for my son and once I saw all the utility it gave him, I knew I had to have one and I'm very glad I made the purchase. You can get less expensive chargers and I have thrown my money away on them. Don't make that mistake. Go with the Anker from the start.",What a feeling of security,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,,

I actually switched to a Galaxy S7 a day before this battery came in the mail. So two brand spanking new products. I plugged my Galaxy into this battery, expecting a super fast charge, just like the quote I posted says, as did so many of the 5 star reviews. Well, after an hour and twenty minutes, I had gone from 2% to a whopping 19%. Yeah, I don't consider that fast. I called Anker and was told that this product does not support fast charge, but rather the PowerCore 20000 does. If this product doesn't support fast charge, don't put in the description that the product has technology to deliver the fastest charge possible. Not everyone is a techie, so the whole not having Qualcomm thing will go over a lot of people's heads (like mine). From what I gather, this battery is geared more towards being able to charge your phone, tablet, etc. multiple times before needing to be recharged itself, and not actually charge your products quickly.

In my tests, a fully charged bank provided enough juice to charge my phone 5 times and my tablet one and a half times. This was more than sufficient for me to get through the week when I am on road.Now for the cons, this has a smooth finish which slips from your hand quickly if not careful. This could cause accidental drops and damages. I wish Anker had changed the texture so that it feels firm in your hands.Secondly, the pouch provided was flimsy, not a deal breaker but would have liked a better pouch that would provide protection than just aesthetic appeal.  Overall,  a great product that is functionally well made with minor flaws in presentation.","Functionally good, could be better with presentation",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,,

PowerIQ. VoltageBoost. What else needs to be said? Go buy it.For those of you who don’t know which battery pack and need further guidance, keep reading. I’m a frequent road warrior traveler and I need an external battery pack for my smartphone. I previously own several other brands battery  and I stuck with them because they’ve been so good to me. And they’re great to have especially in your luggage or in your car, because you never know when you’ll run out of juice. But there are several reasons why the Anker 20100 stands above and beyond its competitions:1. Simultaneously dual 2.4A/5V output through both USB port! This is extremely great to have around. No longer do you have pick and choose which device gets charge faster. The issue with New Trent is one of the USB is 2.1A/5V and the other is 1A/5V. Which meant one device would have taken a significant amount of time to charge. With a tablet and smartphone, it always meant one of them wouldn’t be charged in time. It’s a constant hassle to juggle the charging.2. PowerIQ and VoltageBoost! Means whatever device or whatever USB cable you have, your device will charged at the most optimal rate. I thought this was just some marketing lingo to attract customers, but when you compare the charge time between the New Trent vs Anker, it’s nearly half the time. It’s not a scientific analysis, but Anker 20100 is significantly faster than any of my New Trent external battery packs from what I’ve observed.",I previously own several other brands battery and I stuck with them because they’ve been so good to me,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,,

Even my wife makes fun of me, but hey - our family's gadgets are always charged! I own more than a dozen of these from various manufacturers (Jackery, Monoprice, several others) and in various capacities. While some of these have been solid units this Anker is my favorite for a few reasons. The first reason is size - this is the smallest 20,000+mAh charger I've found. The second reason is weight - also the lightest one I own. The final reason is output - not every charger that claims to supply 2.4mAh or more to each outlet (especially simultaneously) does. The Anker, however, is rock solid. As a side note, for anyone who has had issues with the charging of this charger (or any other one for that matter) the issue is almost always with the cable you are using and not the charger its self. Use the high quality Anker cable that comes with this bad bot and you will be fine. Use a 10ft no-name usb cable from el-cheapo-cables.com and don't be surprised if this or any other device won't charge. So... if you need crazy big charging capacity (and who doesn't these days) bang for your buck this is the one to get!",Even my makes fun of me,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,,,,
