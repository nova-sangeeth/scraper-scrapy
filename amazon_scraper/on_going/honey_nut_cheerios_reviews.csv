They are full of flavor & definitely fresh. I attached pictures of the nutritional value that are not shown in the description of the Cheerios. The front left corner is deceiving because it claims 140 calories but that‚Äôs if you have 1 cup of just Cheerios alone~no milk. If you chose 1 cup with skim milk it‚Äôs 180 calories. As you can see from my pictures this is loaded with sugar & carbs. This is not the most healthiest breakfast & I assume most people eat more than 1 cup. It does offer a variety of essential vitamins which are needed each day~a positive. All in all it‚Äôs your choice to choose this as your morning breakfast.
