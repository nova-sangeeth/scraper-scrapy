I didn’t want to spend a lot since we rent it but the amount of bugs coming from underneath was annoying.The material is very flexible and pliable which is great. A lot of these that I’ve used at big box stores tend to be somewhat rigid and want to fall off the minute you open the door. For my application, the door itself is raised up about 2” from the floor, so I didn’t have to worry about it dragging. However the door is 90 years old so it’s seen a lot of wear and tear but this thing works perfectly. So impressed with how easy it was to apply, you can guide it along as you need to since it’s so flexible. I never thought I’d get excited about a door draft stopper but this is that moment. I fully don’t expect the adhesive to hold in my application simply because parts of the door are coming off and paint is flaking. But, I’ll put some staples in and call it a day. The adhesive is VERY strong much like the 3M double sided sticky tape. Much better than any other adhesive I’ve seen on door draft stoppers. Plus it comes in a two pack!!! Which clearly I did not read - bonus!!!It was so easy even my dog was able to help me install it.

I work from home and the noise level from other areas of the house was too much. I would  close the door but found that was not much help. Rather than replace the doors, I decided to try these door draft stoppers. To my surprise and pleasure they worked perfectly to reduce the amount of noise coming from the other rooms.They are very easy to cut to size and easy to apply. For one door, I got the strip a little too high on the door and was worried that taking it off again would remove the paint on the door and probably would never stick again. I was wrong on both counts. The strip came off easily without taking off any paint and went back on securely. I am very happy with this product. I have yet to try these on the outside doors as I will need to remove the old hardware first, so I cannot attest to whether or not they do well to prevent drafts. That is my next project, as for now I know they are exactly what I wanted for the inside doors. They look beautiful on the doors (you can hardly tell they are there), they are very easy to assemble and they do a great job of reducing the light and noise.","Easy to cut, easy to adjust, stay secure and reduce light and noise",Color Name: WhiteVerified Purchase,39 people found this helpful

If you find the stopper is too long for the door, they're easy to cut with regular scissors (I'd suggest using a ruler and a pencil so you cut the right amount). Applying is quick! You should clean the section you'll be applying, but also dust around the floor as the adhesive may pick up some unwanted dust/hairs. Even if you put it on and find it's not aligned or want it at a different height, you can easily remove and re-apply.I will caution (and only downside): if you're renting you may end having to pay to fix up the bottom of the door (if the landlord needs it removed) as the adhesion is very, very strong and will remove some of the door's paint.Pro: it will stay attached to a metal stopper!
