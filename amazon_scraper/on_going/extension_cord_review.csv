But there's no outlet on that side of the narrow wall it's against, and while I could snake the rather short microwave cord back around to the kitchen outlet, my similarly short cord on the Keurig had nowhere to go.  So I figured another power strip was in order.  I didn't much care about surge protection, but this one caught my eye because the plug is flat, meaning I could plug it in behind the nearby loveseat and not risk crushing it against the wall.  The 10 foot cord was actually a bit more than I needed, and I knew that going in, but it means I was able to place it almost completely out of sight and have some cord length to spare.  It's pretty heavy duty and seems better made than the other power strips I've been using for years in different rooms.

The power strip is like most power strips you pay $10 bucks for. It is a cheap plastic object. The only thing heavy duty is the cord. That is OK as I paid $10 for it. However, I can't even use the product due to the male plug being configured in such a manner that I can only plug it into the bottom of a flat outlet box. However, I have multiple outlet boxes that can't use this type of plug at all and I am limited with other outlets to only being able to use this type of plug in the bottom outlet which I don't have available for most of the outlets. So, take a  look at the plug configuration on the end of this cord. The  way the plug lays down  flat with the cord and going into the outlet at an angle rather than being parallel with the cord  and going straight into the outlet means I can't use this power strip. So, make sure you look closely at the outlet you plan to use this power strip in and be sure the plug will not cause you issues.",Not Happy With This Power Strip.

It fits very snug in a 0.37 inch cable clip (purchased separately) as shown in the photos.When shook, the item clearly had something small inside which had broken loose. I opened it up and found that it was a small piece of solder, see photos.The case has 5 Phillips head screws and 1 triangle screw.The cord is to the side and at an angle to hug the wall and give room for another plug underneath, as shown.This item works as expected. The only drawback was the loose bit of solder. The item, mainly the cord, had small and insignificant amounts of dirtiness that easily wiped off.—-Black 8ft Version:I purchased the Black 8 foot version of this product and it leads me back to the review page for the white 10 foot version so I’m adding this revision. PLEASE BE AWARE that the keyhole slots for wall hanging on the black one are upside down. So at best it can only be mounted sideways or upside down. I did not have this issue with the white one. I would NOT have purchased the black one if I had realized that. The only photo of the keyholes on the black one are on the bottom of the page, not on the top display images.I suppose you could try to modify it by cutting out a small slot for the a nail or screw to catch, like I have, but please note the electric board is immediately above that upper keyhole so you will want to avoid that with a metal screw or nail. Maybe there are other ways to mount it, like double sided tape, but the keyholes are basically useless if you want to mount it vertically upright.The black version has the same set of screws as the white one, 5 Phillips and 1 Triangle.All in all I will likely avoid GE products in the future after this. It’s inexpensive but the usability of the products is very low due to one having upside down keyholes and one having loose solder moving around freely.I will add that they have both survived one electrical storm where power went out for a few minutes several different times.","Inexpensive, work as expected, but will NOT buy again",Size: 10 ftStyle: 1 PackVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

(We went a month without hot water since water heaters were on back order everywhere.) The immersion heater draws a lot of electricity (1500W) and the nearest outlet was far from our bathtub, on the far wall past the sink; so we needed a reliable extension outlet...and this GE Surge Protector proved to be the perfect solution. (It's approved to handle up to 1800W and 120V.)I particularly appreciated the on/off switch on the surge protector, which made it easy to turn off power to the immersion heater when the water was warm enough, so I didn't have to worry about unplugging the device with wet hands. I also liked the surge protector's flat plug head and angled cord, which helped the cord easily clear the sink counter above which it was plugged.When using a surge protector/extension cord with a device that draws as much power as an immersion heater, it's important to make sure you only have one device plugged into the power strip and that the power strip is the only item plugged into that particular wall outlet. We only used one of the surge protector's outlets, and kept the other 5 outlet covers rotated to keep dust and water out of the sockets. As such, we never had a problem with the circuit being overloaded.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the performance of this GE Surge Protector/Extension Cord. It reliably handled several weeks of daily immersion heater use, with the immersion heater running for 1.5 to 2 hours for each bath, once or twice per day. Now that our water heater is repaired, I moved this surge protector to my office, where I have every confidence it will do an equally good job of protecting my computer and other electronic devices. And given the price, I think it's a great value!

The plug itself is slightly thick and due to the shape of the plug and cord, you can only plug in thinner plugs below it, but thicker cords can go above it. This matters, though!I have a lightswitch that turns on and off the bottom outlets and I couldn't use my preferred lamp because of the cord shape. And I have no ceiling light, so the bottom outlet needed to be connected to a lamp so I could see when I walked in my room at night.  Fortunately, I have two lamps.For the surge protector, I need this to be easily accessible and not able to be turned off because I turned off the lightswitch, so it has to be on top. It has the power for my TV and PS4, so I cannot improperly turn those off when using the TV as a second monitor or when playing games. Fortunately, most 2-prong outlets should fit just fine below it. And if you don't have my problem, you're probably fine and can fit everything on this outlet.It works great and I love that I can turn the outlets not in use so no one tries to electrocute themselves with their claws.
