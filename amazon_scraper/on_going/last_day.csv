Fully fleshed-out characters! Strangely, this felt more like ""women's fiction"" as opposed to ""thriller/mystery/amateur-sleuth"" categories. Perhaps I'm the only one who felt that way, or the categorization was done to reach a wider audience as there is, definitely, a bit of an overlap.l liked that this book is longer than most of the Amazon published works I've tried so far. That length gave it a ""meaty"" feeling plot and characters, like a full Thanksgiving dinner, as opposed to some of the Amazon works I've tried that were potatoes with no gravy.The author does a fantastic job of ""showing"" deep anguish, rather than ""telling."" For example, you get a heart-wrenching passage when the daughter of someone murdered says she doesn't want a new iPhone to replace the one she broke, but instead wants the screen replaced as her mom gave her that phone. Then she goes on to say, ""I don't need new school things. I don't want anything new... I don't want anything mom hasn't seen. Hasn't touched...."" It might not sound as powerful here, but in the context it's breath taking.The parts I did not care for are that it was less of a suspense/mystery and more the women contemporary fiction focus. Anyone who enjoys both areas will LOVE this book. At times I was engrossed, but at other times not as interested. For those wondering, there are no graphic sex scenes. There are several handfuls of curse words (15 - 20 or so) thrown in, particularly at about 25% through or so. It seemed an unnecessary distraction. At one point I really had a chuckle and was pulled out of the story when the narration ""uses"" a curse word!! I'm sure it must have been intended as a character's thoughts; but it didn't read that way for me.Overall, lovely, talented writing! I think this will most appeal to people who like movies like ""Beaches"" or ""Thelma and Louise,"" not that the plots are similar, but just that it has that women friendship/secrets/overcoming hardships focus more than the thriller/mystery feel.","Well Written, But Felt Like a Different Genre",Verified Purchase,94 people found this helpful

I liked the first 80% or so of the book. The characters were interesting, and the grief they carry felt genuine. It was engrossing for me. The ending just fell on its face. Possible spoiler alert...I couldn't buy any part of the murderer. The final reveal/confession felt clumsy and rushed. Motive was weak. I couldn't picture the character actually following through on a heinous crime to kill a pregnant woman by strangulation...the author herself points out it takes several minutes of this murderer looking this victim in the face watching her die. I don't buy that the murderer had sufficient motive, strength, or cruelty to do it. The author does next to nothing to sell it, or to tie up loose ends with the characters. It's a shame because the one loose end she tied up was touchingly done. Other reviewers have pointed out that all the repeated references to flashy cars and wealth detracted from the book; agreed. There were comments about two fairly brief but heartbreaking descriptions of the unborn baby's death; it was hard to read but the author didn't spend so much time on it that it seemed obscene.  It read like she was trying to do justice to a voiceless character's death. But I can see how others felt it disturbing. Overall the book was a steady page-turner about a heinous crime with a large cast of characters, some pretty compelling, that was utterly failed by the rushed, awkward ending and a completely unbelievable and uninteresting villain.",Good Start but Ending Flops,Verified Purchase,80 people found this helpful

I enjoyed the haunting scene that was described at the beginning of this book which I read using the Look Inside feature and that’s why I chose this book but it’s just downhill from there. I still held out hope for at least an ok procedural but this book really falls apart towards the end, and I saw where it was going so I don’t say that because I was at all surprised. Unfortunately the author chose to have this story play out with multiple POVs which do nothing to serve the story but instead make this much less interesting. It was far better served in the beginning with the POVs left to the grieving sister Kate and the detective Owen on the case. As the POVs shift between friends and family of the deceased Beth we don’t actually learn anything but instead the author’s trying to draw out the reveal of the killer by leaving different ideas for the reader. Unfortunately most of the people are not at all compelling and again it doesn’t serve the story.

It is that but at its core, it is women’s fiction. The central characters are all women, with the men in their lives mostly peripheral.The story is primarily concerned with Beth and Kate Lathrop, and Beth’s daughter, Samantha. Rounding out the characters are Lulu and Scotty, Beth and Kate’s lifelong friends.The story starts out with the pregnant Beth lying in bed with descriptions of her bedroom and the house and garden. Her sister Kate, who’s a private pilot, is worried because her sister hasn’t been answering her phone calls and texts. She calls the police who help her break in, only to discover that Beth has been murdered and the valuable painting, Moonlight, has been stolen. The description of Beth lying in her bed without disclosing her death sets a tone that’s repeated through flashbacks of times with her sister, Kate, and the other members of their all-female clan.This is a disturbing replay of a crime that occurred while Kate and Beth were teenagers, resulting in their mother’s death. The girls and their mother were tied up in the basement of the family’s art gallery and the painting, Moonlight, was stolen: the same painting that was stolen from Beth’s bedroom. Also complicating things is that the police officer who released Kate and Beth from their bonds that day is also the detective who helps Kate break into Beth’s home only to discover her dead body.The initial suspect is Beth’s husband, Peter, who despite having what appears to be an ironclad alibi, has fathered a child with one of the gallery’s employees.Even though Beth’s husband is the immediate suspect, Rice does a good job handling other possible perpetrators, holding out the solution until the very end, which turns out to be a logical surprise. While I found some of the dialogue could have been improved by contractions, that observation doesn’t detract from some of the beautiful passages the book contains. Particularly poignant was the scene where Kate visits her father in prison for the first time. He’s serving a life sentence for the murder of his wife, Kate’s mother, and Kate has sworn she would never visit him.The driver of the story is the relationship between the four female friends and Beth’s daughter, Sam.

After reading Last Day I am surprised at the number of 5 star reviews it has received. I did think the characters were mostly well developed and as a reader I was drawn in to how they became the people they did - the trauma the two sisters, Kate and Beth, had when their mother was murdered, why their father hired people to rob the art gallery and in that robbery was the cause of their mother's death, why each of the daughters went down the paths they did as adults, why Beth married the kind of man she did who wasn't all that different than her father, why Pete, the husband, cheated on Beth, why Beth cheated on Pete, the lifelong friendship of Kate, Beth, Lulu and Scotty. What I had a hard time believing right from the beginning was the obsession the detective investigating both the sisters' mother's murder and Beth's murder had over the sisters. It had been 23 years since their mother's murder and he still drove by the daughters' houses regularly. Of course Detective Reid believes Pete, Beth's husband, is the murderer. As a reader, I wanted to believe he was, too. His alibi is airtight - or is it? Without trying to give the ending away the reason I've given this book 2 stars is because the timelines don't make sense. The first timeline and the events around it is Beth's pregnancy and who the baby's father is. The second is of the murderer's actions on the day of the murder especially since the husband's actions are corroborated by the friend who picked him up for their sailing trip and there's no mention that the murderer lay in wait for him to leave. (The murderer admits to being at the house earlier.) If the murderer's rage was fueled by being drunk, how was the staging possible?  If those two timelines fail, and I believe they do, then things could not have played out as presented. It's impossible. Yes, it's fiction, but if I can't believe the events played out the way the author presents them, then the book fails for me.

Rice books have always seemed  paean to the victory of the human soul, to our ability to overcome tragedy.  Perhaps that's why this book is such a huge disappointment.An author who writes a whodunit makes a contract with her reader. In the end, even if the answer seems  a shock, we will realize we've been carefully fed the clues we'd need to piece the puzzle together.  Not so here.When the truth is almost magically revealed just at the story's end, it quite literally comes out of nowhere. There has been no set-up nor anything to suggest a reasonable motive or even to make us believe this particular character is capable of such actions.The jigsaw us carefully constructed, but the final piece does not fit. It's roughly three times too large for the hole it's supposed to fit and has jagged edges that do not connect to the smoothed-off space left for it.Worse, the answer breaks that reader-writer contract.

As I said in my earlier review, Rice delves potently into serious relationship issues, and her understanding of them, and development of plot lines based on early trauma, are unparalleled.The narrative begins with the brutal murder of Beth, one of two sisters who, as teens, spent 22 hours tied up in the basement of the family gallery with their mother. All three were gagged, and the mother suffocated as a result. The girls survived, but were, in very different ways, PTSD sufferers. Kate, the elder sister (though they were only a year apart) walled herself off and became a pilot, highly competent but very asocial, while Beth, who married, continued to run the gallery. At the time she was killed, Beth was the mother of a 16-year-old daughter Sam, was also pregnant with a boy baby (who died with her) and was experiencing marital difficulties. Kate, who had been flying a cross-country charter flight, arrived home frantic because Beth had returned none of her phone calls, and having the police break into the house, found her sister’s body.The story is gripping and nuanced, and the characters are meticulously developed. The cast includes not only the sisters, but their two best friends, Lulu and Scottie; Sam; the husbands of Beth and Scottie; and the various detectives on the case; as well as Scottie’s daughters Isabel and Julie. In addition there are peripheral characters who turn out to have important roles in the story. Although this book was not one which I am obligated to review as part of my Vine commitment, I found it thoroughly enjoyable and deeply engaging, and I recommend it highly.",Thoroughly enjoyable and deeply engaging,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

A yellow warbler, perched for ten seconds on the silver-tipped branch of a bayberry bush, looked like pure gold.”But the characters were one dimensional and lacked substance. There was a lot of unnecessary padding, which slowed the pace at times and had me skipping instead of turning pages.The backstory (of Kate, Beth and their mother in the basement) is repeated ad nauseum, and the author relies too much on that backstory to build what are essentially cookie-cutter, one dimensional characters that fall flat. For instance, Kate is a pilot, and that metaphor of restlessness and transience is heavily relied on to imbue Kate’s character and interior life. Beth, is nauseatingly kind and good, with many many mentions of her selfless work down at the soup kitchen—never mind the fact that she’s a privileged woman with nothing better to do. Detective Reid’s character also lacked dimension and depth, with Rice relying again on the sisters’ trauma and anchoring it as the only defining (and disturbing) moment in his life.If this was television, Last Day would be a network show—glossy, lacking substance, and written around commercial breaks.",Dazzling descriptions but lacked depth,Verified Purchase,

I enjoyed the characters, the plot with its twists and turns, and trying to see where the surprise was going to come. What ruined it for me was not the plot, but that towards the end of the book, the author employed an unexpected technique: having a chapter from the deceased person’s point of view. The chapter added nothing to the story and derailed the momentum of rapport I was building was the characters. I spent more time feeling derailed by this late-in-the-game switch than I did processing what she was saying. The final chapter was also from the deceased’s POV, which made for an unsatisfactory finale.
