I love this series and always will, but i feel that this is a little childish, book 1. Sure, its a kids series but i feel it didnt have enough wow factor. I know that when the first book came out the kids reading this would be around 9 - 11. This enables the readers to grow with the books because they get darker and darker, readers wont remotely be scared of disturbing content, like Dumbledore dying in the cave. Kids would be about 16 - 17 when this blockbuster series ended so this would not be nightmare inducing.I, however, staryed reading this at about 9 and still found that nothing scared me about the books 6 - 7. This proves, therefore, that this is a timeless classic book for all ages. The charectors are ever strong, proud and kind, the sort of qualities which make a wonderfull book charectors. Hermione, bushy haired and very intelligent, is my favourite charector. At first she seema a side charector to the duo, untill a troll brings them into a well known threesome. Ron is also a good charector. He was always the most loyal, though he at first is a little nervous at the thought of explaining what amount of gold he owned.'This is Scabbers. Hes not my rat, hes Percys, but i get all the hand me downs as we cant affo-' Ron broke off, looking slightly pink.These charectors value traits: Loyalty, Braveness, Kindness and knowledge. Those are important traits in a book, so well done J.K. Rowling.Harry and Voldemort. 'Neither can live while the other survives'. This part confused me a little untill i thought hard. Voldemort chose to kill harry, not neville, for too many reason to list. By that choice, that dosent mean harry HAD to kill Voldemort, it was really Harrys power to love that led him to kill him. They where oppisite beings. Harry is brave, loyal and kind, things Lord Voldemort has never understood because he sought power, and he did not get it, but Harry never did, so that made it almost certain that one would kill the other.These books are amazingly beautiful It is a world in which pigs can fly and mail is owl ppst. It is a world that shows us that if we seek power we will always end up the wrong way. It shows that if you value love and Braveness you will be known for showing that through everything, value friendship and beauty, braveness and the ability to be a free spirit in a endless world of the greatest magic of all: Love.",Amazingly Beautiful books,,

Well, I think the answer to that is that I just love returning to join Harry and his friends in the wizarding world and with having access to Kindle through Alexa I felt I might as well go right ahead and purchase them on Kindle.I just love this book right from the start and even though it isn't as exciting and edge of your seat as the other books are, yet there is that excitement you feel along with Harry in Chapter 4 when Hagrid turns up in the shack during the storm to give him the good news and I don't think any Harry Potter fan could ever fail to feel the excitement along with Harry as he and Hagrid go to Diagon Alley and he buys his books and other material he'll need for his time at Hogwarts.  I love it when his vault at Gringots is opened and he sees all the money his parents have left him.  I love the background we get to the Dursleys in the first chapter and the description of the day which eventually leads to his arrival at Privet Drive.  As we read this book, we need to be aware how little Harry knows and we get an idea of how he's feeling as he awaits his sorting on his arrival at the school.  As the Dursleys fight a losing battle when the letters start coming (and increasing with each delivery, ending with about a hundred at the hotel, you just know that, even though they're eventually in a place where Uncle Vernon's certain they won't be disturbed, that by hook or by crook Dumbledore will eventually get him to Hogwarts.  As he tells Mrs Cole in Book 6, they'll be taking Tom Riddle away whatever.  So Harry begins this roller coaster adventure throughout the seven books and he will not only need his friends but all the magical training he can get, especially in Defence against the dark arts which will be important as he must face the wizard who has not only attempted to kill him but has eluded capture by the Ministry of Magic.","Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, Kindle Copy",Verified Purchase,41 people found this helpful

I know, everybody love Harry Potter and here I am reviewing it anyway.LIKES: üòäüòä1) World Formation: The whole world building is mind-boggling. The wizarding world is very vast and intricately woven as it has witches, wizards, goblins, three-headed dog, dragon, centaurs, unicorns, and whatnot.2) Characterization: All the characters have been well thought out. No character looked like it's only there as a page filler. The book is full of variety of characters from kind-hearted to mean bullies. Step by step building of friendship between the trio (Harry, Ron and Hermione) is just a sight to behold. The unfolding of characters such as Hermione (from bossy know-it-all to a kind soul who acknowledges the efforts of others) and Neville (who being scardy cat all the time, summons up the courage to take a stand against Draco's minions as well as his friends) is inexplicable and neatly done.3) Writing: J.K. Rowling's writing is so vivid that you will wish you were a witch or wizard, too! Writing is simple which makes it easier to dive into. I love all the positivity spreading through her unique writing style and messages. Dersley family's characters is so well written that everyone abhor them to the core.4) Plot: Plot is very unique and intriguing with fast-paced and gripping story. A great plot twist at the end is an add-on bonus. The clues are nicely linked with the each other and very detailed as compared to the movies.DISLIKES: üòíüòí1)¬†I already watched all the movies before the book. Big mistake. So, plot twist at the end was a dead giveaway for me.2) The book is very similar to the movie, so i didn't get to enjoy as much as i should've. Totally my fault!Despite devouring the Harry Potter movie, i loved the book all the same. I recommend it to all the fantasy lovers out there. No matter what age group you belong to, this series is perfect for you. Highly recommended! üòäüôè",Page Turner!,Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

One of the best things about this book is the way the characters develop, learning magic and the ways of the magical world as they, without immediately becoming super powerful and capable of doing anything; the characters, certainly the main trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione, complement each other well with each bringing something to the group.Along the way to the final confrontation there are laughs as well as some more serious scenes, all of which, though the book is intended for a younger audience, fit to be enjoyed by adults.I‚Äôve read Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone more times than I can remember and continue to enjoy it, which I consider as important, if not more so, as how well the book‚Äôs written.

Ich liebe die englische Sprache.

Man muss also nicht unbedingt ein Englischprofi sein, um hier beim Lesen gut voranzukommen.In der Kindleversion steht einem ansonsten die Option Word Wise zur Verf√ºgung, eine Hilfsfunktion f√ºr Englischlernende, bei der schwierige englische Vokabeln direkt √ºber dem betreffenden Wort erl√§utert werden.Au√üerdem hat man per Klick auf's Wort auch direkt die √úbersetzung zur Hand, was l√§stiges Nachschlagen im W√∂rterbuch √ºberfl√ºssig macht.Zum Buchcover kann ich leider nicht sehr viel sagen, da ich eben nur die E-Version besitze.

No hab√≠a salido el segundo a la venta y nunca hubiese imaginado que podr√≠amos llegar a donde estamos hoy, 7 libros que han arrasado creando un universo paralelo de magia y un octavo en camino. Cuando cumpl√≠ 11 a√±os y no me lleg√≥ la carta me doli√≥ bastante (sab√≠a que no era posible pero una parte de mi...).Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal es una introducci√≥n magn√≠fica. J.K. Rowling ha creado desde cero un mundo tan real que, a pesar de estar basado en ""magia"", te parece que est√°s conviviendo realmente con ellos pero eres un muggle y no te has enterado. Por si fuese poco escribe de forma maravillosa, el ritmo nunca decae, y es una novela que la pueden apreciar tanto ni√±os como mayores porque cada edad profundizar√° en mayor o menos medida en la historia.En su momento los le√≠ en espa√±ol, y ahora me parece estupendo leerlos en ingl√©s brit√°nico (el americano tiene expresiones diferentes), que es el original, y as√≠ nos vamos preparando para cuando salga el octavo libro, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.",Un libro que marc√≥ mi infancia,Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

I just think children shouldn't read this book as it could spoil their spellings  and grammar. I hope JK Rowling works on the following in her future books. Let me tell you this, that the  story is extremely good and people who just love fantasy like me will surely love  this book.",No good grammar,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
