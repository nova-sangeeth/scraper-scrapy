It's durable, good-quality materials, sturdy & safe.  The main drawback is the design itself - it's not really practical as a quick-use stool to sit in, because the top bar, the handle, is so positioned that you can't sit straight up in it - one has to lean forward a little; and there are (or was) a similar stool we had once that did allow use as a 'chair', which at times is very handy.  Also, it opens for use in such a way that the top seat doesn't fully click down into place until you put weight on it and then it 'pops' down with an audible ""CLUNK"" (which can also be a surprise if you're already getting up on it).  So it does its work just fine, and if you don't want to use it as a stool, and if you don't mind the 'clunk' of the seat getting firmly in place, no complaints at all.","Firm, well-made step-stool, won't work as a sitting-stool.",Color: GrayStyle: 2-StepPattern Name: Step StoolVerified Purchase,60 people found this helpful

I removed the hard plastic feet under the step side of the ladder (each held on by one screw) and replaced them with 7/8"" rubber leg tips per the photo - total cost a couple of bucks.

Goof-Off will not fail you but might remove some of the paint on the product. for any other remaining sticky glue , sprinkle on some baby powder. there you have it, from someone who up-cycles and needs labels removed from jars, etc.now, on to the actual ladder:it difficult to close after that top step has snapped into place - watch out for your fingers. or maybe in time and with use it gets easier as it gets broken in like a pair of shoes or something. the height of this ladder is awesome for a 5‚Äô6‚Äù lady to change light bulbs in a 9‚Äô ceiling can lights. i didn‚Äôt want one of those wooden fold up things that are bulky and cumbersome so this is a great lightweight alternative. since purchasing this step ladder i‚Äôve already begun to think i can use it to paint these 9‚Äô walls.",for those who want to know how to remove the stickers,Color: PlatinumStyle: 3-StepPattern Name: Step StoolVerified Purchase,9 people found this helpful

There always seem to be a need for them. From painting to changing storm windows to putting up holiday decorations and hanging curtains. The tallest I had was six foot. Anything over that the I went to the pros to have the work done. After my wife passed away I downsized and moved into an apartment which I thought was great. Any work that needed to be done I just called the maintainance office and the problem was fixed usually the same day. I had no need for ladders. That all changed when the apartment complex was sold to a developer and a new set of rules were initiated. With the old management company simple things like hanging curtains or window cleaning were done by the maintainace guys and you would slip them a few dollars. Now you had to hire outside pros to get the work done. Because of the Parkinson‚Äôs I have a home health aide who comes three days a week. She‚Äôs a great gal and has been great company. The agency she works for and my insurance company evaluated my needs and makes a care plan. That plan does not include window washing or anything else that would require her to step up a level. Fortunately for me the aids husband is always looking to make a few dollars extra by doing handi-man work. I supply any necessary materials and he supplies the tools,muscles and knowledge to do the work. The one thing he did‚Äôt have was a ladder under six foot. A Buick search here at Amazon and I came across this step stool. I recognized it immediately as my dad had one just like it. I remembered as a kid using it to help mom clean places she couldn‚Äôt reach. My one concern was that I remembered using the stool when I was in my teens. I‚Äôm almost seventy now so it‚Äôs been awhile. I could only assume that like everything these days the stool wouldn‚Äôt be of the same high quality as I remembered. I need had not worried about that. After taking it out of the shipping box I looked for damage as the cardboard was all torn up. The stool was in great shape. The next thing was the weight of the stool. It seemed much heavier than I remembered which to me is a good thing. Kind of indicates a well made product. The stairs, all three of them have anti slip material and opening it was very smooth. I was pleased but again I wasn‚Äôt the one who was going to use it. The guy who was looked it over and made a trip up and down the stairs a few times and agreed with me it was pretty well made. Storing the stool seemed to cause the biggest problem. Where to put it when not in use. My aide suggested under my bed where I keep the ironing board. It worked. To date we have used it to change the drapes from the summer weight to the winterinsulated ones. To take and clean the tin can collection from the top of the kitchen cabinets and my beer stein collection from the top of my bedroom dresser. Soon the windows,both inside and outside,are being done this week and as soon as the new bedroom curtains come in they will be hung.

One fault in this particular step stool was when I opened it and stepped on the step all was fine till I got to the next step and almost fell off . Apparently the final part that the step stool snaps in securely did not clip in place till I put pressure on it . That part that should slide into place when opened did not do that and any time I open it now I have to put heavy pressure on it to lock it in place. I was going to return it but as long as I remember to make sure it opens securely it is fine. The fear I had being a 68 year old women possibly falling off it, is a constant reminder that whenever I open it, be sure it is snapped in place.
