In more than 20 years, the boat never breaks down, the house doesn't need repairs and she's able to wear the same clothes for many years....she's got long hair that she says is ratty and tangled but description s of it has it down her back, luxurious...she's gorgeous but bathing is optional until in her 20s...she has sex with a philanderer but never gets a vd and not once apparently does she get sick. No flu, cold, nothing....she never got shots and apparently has the immune system of a super hero because she stepped on a nail and never got tetanus....I kept reading so I'd finish and the ending is unexpected but it's generally a boring book where day after day, she's alone in the marsh....",Too unrealistic to enjoy,Verified Purchase,"6,401 people found this helpful"

I thought it was just awful. It took me every minute of the two weeks I had it on loan to get to the end. I don't know why I stuck with it as it was painful every time I picked it up; maybe I was in the mood for masochism. So what's wrong with it? Well, for one thing, every page was screaming at me, ""This is sad. So sad. SO SAD!!!"" I have a strong bias against books that I feel are emotionally manipulating me. As soon as I started reading about The Marsh Girl, I was reminded of 'Beasts of the Southern Wild,' a wonderful story of a little girl living alone with her sick father in the swamps. Mother gone, dad drinks too much and frequently disappears, both try to avoid the bad, bad authorities, and both love the natural environment even though it causes hardships--but that's where the similarity ends. 'Where the Crawdads Sing' should hope to be a tenth as good (but it isn't). It also can't decide whether it is a coming of age story or a murder mystery; the chapters jump between telling the story of Kya's life and the investigation of a murder for which she is later tried. And those trial scenes were the absolute most hackneyed that I have ever read. Old Perry Mason scripts were better. Secondary character--with the exception of Jumpin', a black man who runs a tiny gas station/convenience store that serves boaters, and his wife Mabel, are total stereotypes. 1) Jordie, the helpful older brother who quickly disappears, leaving Kya alone with 2) the drunken, abusive dad who isn't all bad when he's sober. 3) The Good Boy, Tate, who becomes Kya's only friend, and 4) The Bad Boy, Chase, the seduce-and-abandon type. 5) The cocky police chief and 6) his cocky assistant and 7) the cocky prosecutor. As to the writing: I love nature as much as the next person, but the writing in the long, long, tedious, repetitive passages describing shells and sea gulls and bird feathers and fireflies were, in my opinion, just plain bad (but not as bad as the trial chapters).  And a really bad ""surprise"" ending.I could go on, but just--ugh.","Overrated, Dull, Unbelievable, Trite",,666 people found this helpful

Do not read this review if you don’t want to find out who killed Chase.I am giving this book 3 stars despite my own annoyance at all the errors in geography, history, and dialect. I understand the need for a willing suspension of disbelief, but this novel asks too much of the careful reader. I found some of the descriptions enjoyable, and I think the book has a place in the categories of “chick lit” and YA fiction. Some of the prose is good; some is awful. Teenage girls will find passages like this one swoon-worthy: “Then, as she whirled around, she bumped into Tate, who had stood, and they froze, staring into each other’s eyes. They stopped laughing. Tate took her shoulders, hesitated an instant, then kissed her lips, as the leaves rained and danced around them as silently as snow.” (p.124)Too often I had to put the book down and exclaim “What? That’s ridiculous!” Many aspects of the plot make no sense. Nor do some of the characterizations. Consider Kya. From age 6, she raises herself with almost no adult guidance. She is practically feral without access to health care, dental care, good nutrition or personal hygiene needs. Yet she grows up to be a strong, healthy woman who turns heads with her beauty and her “wasp-thin waist,” a brilliant observer of birds and a successful, self-taught artist. She is completely illiterate at age 14, yet in her first reading lesson with Tate, she learns the letters of the alphabet, memorizes all their sounds and reads her first sentence—not from a children’s book, but from a book of essays on nature. (p. 193) Anyone who has ever worked with a beginning reader knows this is impossible.The novel paints a Disneyesque picture of the salt marsh. Unlike the real N.C. coast, it’s never cold or harsh or dangerous for a little girl. The animals are almost friends and there are no mosquitos or snakes. Hurricane Hazel, which devastated the N.C. Coast in 1954, when Kya would have been around 8, did not destroy her shack. In fact, it apparently didn’t happen at all. The author is supposed to be an expert on animals, but even some of the animals are wrong. Seen from a boat: “Brilliant white herons and storks stood among water lilies and floating plants....” (p.176) White egrets, maybe, but white herons are rarely seen north of the Florida Keys. Wood storks (the only North American stork) were first recorded in N .C. In 2005 and sightings are still rare.When I read that Kya’s father was heading for Asheville to discuss his army disability, I thought “Why would he go there rather than somewhere closer?” Numerous references to Asheville follow as if it’s a nearby city. No one on the N.C. coast would think of going “over to Asheville” to buy a birthday present or pick up supplies as they do in the story. It’s a seven-hour trip today, but in the 1950s, there were no Interstate or divided highways, making it an all-day trip. Kya’s father tells her that his family was once very well off, living on a plantation near Asheville and growing tobacco and cotton until the weevils got the cotton. (p. 57) Didn’t the author do any fact checking? Cotton was never grown in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It isn’t the right climate. There’s plenty of cotton in North Carolina, but it’s almost all grown in the Coastal Plains with a little in the Piedmont. Kya’s father tells her how he was expected to become a lawyer and “live in a columned mansion.” (p. 106) If he grew up in a wealthy, educated family, where did he get his uncultivated speech patterns?The characters of Tate and Chase, Kya’s good-boy, bad-boy suitors are inconsistent (two unlikely names for small-town Carolina boys born in the 1940s). Tate grows very close to Kya and seems to love her and consider taking her with him, then decides “Nah, she’s not going to fit in.” Suddenly, he’s heartless and cruel? He turns his back and abandons her completely while he’s in college. Then Chase, the real cad, nurtures a close relationship with Kya for a year to earn enough of her trust to take her to bed. Could he really maintain such false tenderness for so long while making fun of her behind her back? And would he sentimentally wear the shell necklace she gave him, yet try to rape her when he catches her alone? It doesn’t add up.Kya herself is the most inconsistent character of all—a regular Keyser Soze in the end. Throughout the story she is gentle, reclusive, sensitive, hesitant, meek. Then we find at the end that she has plotted carefully to sneak back to Barkley Cove using two different disguises, planning bus schedules perfectly, luring Chase to the water tower late at night, overpowering and killing him, then covering her tracks and successfully feigning total innocence.I could go on here—there are many more points of absurdity. I know this book is a page turner for its huge number of fans, but I wouldn’t recommend it for the close reader who expects more authenticity.","Even in Fiction, Authenticity Counts",Verified Purchase,263 people found this helpful

There are many plot holes. For example, Kya drives an unlicensed boat around the swamp for many years. Even back in the 60’s, boats had to have an annual license. Another: we find at the end of the book that she’d received mail for many years after the reader is told that all that was ever in her mailbox was advertisements. There are several others. Many characters are stereotyped caricatures, and the dialogue was often contrived or predictable. Hard for me to understand how so many have given this five stars. Weak plot.

That's never a good thing, but the truth is, although there were many things to love in this story, there were many things I found lacking.First, the prose was absolutely stunning and beautifully descriptive. The problem for me was, amazing descriptions don't wow me. Amazing stories do. And I'm not entirely sure this was an amazing story.Second, the characters, Kya included, never really came to life for me. They all seemed flat and uninspired. At its roots, this is nothing more than a ""girl from the wrong side of the tracks"" story. Think Pretty In Pink, but set in a coastal marsh.Third, so much of the story line was simply implausible. From the abandonment, to the lack of interest in this young girl, to the trial--especially the trial.

But it's a little more ambitious than that, and there are significant flaws. For some the editor (was there one?) was probably more at fault than the author. The most glaring, constantly annoying issue was the dialogue. White characters in 1960s/70s small town NC speak in perfect modern English (80% of the time), black characters in a vernacular. It's laughably racist. There are other instances of sloppiness with details and lack of thought and research. Maybe no research. It is like the author has never been to NC. The time and place just aren't consistently established. Kya gets running water installed. What does that mean? She already had a well. That's running water. She certainly didn't get hooked up to a municipal water supply. Likewise electricity. The fix it man did what, exactly, to get electrical service to her shack? Bubba doesn’t just run miles of electrical wires through a marsh. You have to call the electric company. The local marina starts selling $3.50 espresso before women enter the local watering hole for the first time in history. The main character is so beautiful she attracts both of the most eligible men in town. Plausible for a teen, but by her twenties she’d probably have a unibrow and her teeth would be falling out. She is self educated to a university standard, but her mom didn’t teach her to read when she was six? She couldn’t spell dog at the age of seven? Really smart kids learn to read very fast. If mom painted watercolors, genius six year old would be reading. Well.I was shocked to learn the author is a naturalist. I would think that background would make her very unlikely to make these kinds of errors. A more significant flaw is the plausibility of Kya's circumstances as a child and adult. Also, Tate's years long disappearance - what the hell?I enjoyed the book, and would not discourage anyone from reading it if they were bored and looking for light entertainment, but I think it's overrated.

From Kya raising herself beginning at a very young age, to EVERYONE leaving her, to her killing someone it was all too much for me.  Kya never got sick or badly injured, needed a doctor, dentist?  This strong character goes to school for one day and is bullied away?  She had a wonderful relationship with her brother Jody, who then leaves her and never contacts her again for years.  He left her to live in a dilapidated shack ,with an abusive, irresponsible, neglectful  father.  That is not something this character would have done.  Next, Tate befriends her and presumably loves her.  He knows everyone has left her and he does also.  How could you do that to someone you love?  Neither character has a reasonable excuse for not contacting her in any way for years.Overall, the author used too much drama to develop the character she was trying to create.

Some parts of it are well-written, but the ""dialect"" writing is cringe-producing.  It's clear that the author has never heard a real Southerner speak:  she sort of fused Appalachian dialect with low-country dialect in a way that makes no sense and is a bit insulting to Southerners of all races.It has to be noted that the murder mystery at the heart of the book does keep the plot moving. But the plot is also pretty predictable and has the usual structure of a romance novel:  girl meets boy in childhood; falls in love with boy as a teen; boy leaves girl; girl meets bad boy; good boy comes back; then girl has to choose between ""sensible"" relationship with stable good boy or wild, irrational relationship with sexy bad boy.  If you like this sort of thing, just buy a bodice ripper!  Also it goes without saying that the protagonist girl is of course beautiful and even gorgeous, although she grew up alone eating only grits for years, not a recipe for the body beautiful.Other reviewers have noticed the lack of plausibility in the plot: that a girl child could survive in a swamp alone at age seven, then learn to read and become a kind of biology savant.  But this is part of the fantasy!  You can be wild and free like Pippi Longstocking with no parents, but also literate and even make money writing!  And never have a job or kids, and be married to a really great guy!It bothers me that this book was a best-seller.

The rest of the time the dialogue was often rather trite and like a middle-schooler trying to write it.

I loved the writing--the way the author put words together creating a beautiful scene. She is very talented and has a wonderful, lilting, poetic, picturesque way about her prose. I enjoyed it. I also liked her main story idea of this young girl being abandoned out in the marsh, but learns to survive on her own. I believe someone like her could be a 'scientist' of sorts. I imagine someone like her could find and accurately categorize the wildlife, flora, and fauna of the place that is her whole world. But, her rise in the 'academic world' just wasn't believable. Very intriguing idea, but not convincing. Maybe I'm just a little too much of a realist to completely lose myself in that aspect of the story. Perhaps if the author would have described some 'hardships' other than extreme loneliness (and at first hunger).  Everything on the marsh was just so romantic and beautiful. What about the reality of living on the marsh? The bugs in the food, the idea of using the woods for nature calls esp. during that time of the month, or when you've got food poisoning from no refrigeration, or catch a cold, or suffer from numerous insect bites making your skin look terrible from excessive scratching, or what happens if you cut yourself, break a bone or need antibiotics? What person escapes childhood (even with lots of adults around) without any sickness or injury requiring adult intervention? Everything was just too beautiful--almost Disney-fied. Nothing (but humans) can hurt you in the marsh...yeah right. And the fact that she was just so beautiful and irresistible was also just a bit unbelievable.  We're talking about someone who isn't going to have the best hygiene, wouldn't have shaved her legs or armpits, no visits to the dentist, no floss, etc. etc. Her hair was long, beautiful, flowing...all the time without any products or seeing a professional. Marsh life would be tough on hair I would imagine. Yeah, all right, you could say all these miraculous beauty secrets COULD happen with some kind of natural remedies, but I have big doubts. I'm just saying some of the 'she is like a beautiful fairy with flowers intertwined in her luscious hair; her clear, unbitten, unblemished, flawless skin, and a perfect figure'...bothered me. Yes, she could be naturally beautiful, but what about every day hardships? Maybe throw in a few realistic aspects of living in the wild. Just watching Survivor would show you how people really look after time in the wild. Some of it ain't pretty. So, the Marsh girl is beautiful and smarter than anyone could imagine...almost everyone misjudges her. That whole theme went a little overboard in my opinion. And the conversations that she had with her love interests...unbelievably boring. I kept listening for some sign that there was all that intellect hidden under that Disney princess hair, but if you judge her on her dialogue alone? Yawn. Also, when the author has the main character reading poetry...I always picture the writer thinking, ""filler...I need filler...""  A little bit is fine, but too much becomes distracting IMO.  Overall, despite my somewhat critical review, I enjoyed this book enough to give it four stars. I just thought a little too much suspension of belief distracted me from the story. Others may not find the Gorgeous-Nymph-in-a-boat in a magical marsh where she's friends with all creatures-fairytale as unbelievable or irritating as I  did.  But, still it was an entertaining read and that is usually what I judge books on.

There are myriad towns and cities along the way.  No one, ever, would ""run to Asheville"" from the coast to buy a bike or supplies for their boat.  It would take less time to travel there from Baltimore, MD.  This, with other breaks from reality, such as no hurricanes affecting the lay of marsh during the Marsh Girl's time there (a very active couple of decades for hurricanes in that area) and DNA being standard college curriculum in the early 1960's; plus the ridiculous way in which the characters speak, bearing no resemblance to what is a very distinct regional accent, made for a painful read.

""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is the story of a young girl, Kya Clark, abandoned by nearly everyone: her family, her community, the school system. Throughout it all, she's managed to survive and piece together a meaningful life for herself filled with nature and the marsh she resides in. The readers get the chance to grow with Kya, the writer chronicling her journey as a young girl to her older age. The second story happening in the book is the unraveling of a murder and whether or not Kya played a role in it.There are certain parts throughout the book where I had to suspend my disbelief in order to power through the story. One of which was the high school quarterback interested in Kya as was Tate, a man who left for college but was haunted by memories and desires of his time with her. Perhaps this is me but realistically, I couldn't imagine either of those things happening based on Kya's interactions with either man. There was also no female bonding, just Kya being surrounded by them to offer her a helping hand. Both individuals seemed written to type, the classic good guy/bad guy scenario, which made the decision-making process in the love triangle relatively easy. I also thought that the pacing in the novel slowed down the story for me, as did the nature descriptions and many outdoors scenes where Kya is alone, inspecting the marsh. Though beautifully written, I never felt like those scenes moved the story along. It felt unnecessary to me.I don't want to reveal spoilers about the end but I rolled my eyes at some of the reveals.

First off, the setting. I am from North Carolina and don't recognize anything about the author's descriptions. Where is this marsh/swamp? Why are there BEARS there? Why in the world would people from the coast drive clear across the state to Ashville just to buy a bike? Why does the author describe loads of historic buildings in an area that gets regularly slammed by hurricanes? Why did she choose to give all of her characters absurd accents that read nothing like a real eastern NC accent (which is distinctive)? Why did she have them go barefoot in winter without mentioning that it gets dang COLD in the winter? It was clear from page one that the author knows next to nothing about North Carolina, its people, its wildlife or its history. So why set the story there? Why even bother to make it a real place, or to presumably teach us about its habitats and wildlife?Authors invent, and that's fine.

For some, anything Virginia and below seems one big redneck wasteland where the people, culture, and lack of education are all the same. It's sometimes shocking to me just how many people from other parts of the country hold on to a stereotype that has no bearing on anything I see when I go back to North Carolina. And this book plays into those stereotypes. It treats NC as though it were a sampling of South Carolina (where the real 'Low Country' is), Georgia and Louisiana. It surprised me that the editorial team didn't care about or realize how many errors there are. Did they really think there are bears on the beaches of NC? Did they forget about hurricane season? Did they not even glance at a map? Add to that the many, many professional writers who reviewed this book and caught NONE of these glaring factual errors.

BUT, having spent my life on the coastal plains of Virginia and both Carolinas in the past 68 years, I became increasingly bothered by the author's  nearly total ignorance of her setting and that led me to wonder if the details of the marine life were also manipulated.  Simply put, the book is embellished with all sorts of environmental details which are just wrong.  Has the author ever visited the coast of North Carolina or even looked at a map???The first big error, repeated several times was geographic.  Asheville is a good 6 hour drive from anywhere on the coast of North Carolina.  Not even middle class locals would have traveled there to go to Sears or conduct any other business way out in the mountains.  The Low Country is in the southern half of South Carolina. Palmettos and Spanish moss may be found now and then in North Carolina but the landscape she described was pretty heavy on South Carolina  flora.  Then toward the end of the book, she described Kya's black friends not being allowed to wait with her white supporters in the courthouse or eat lunch with them in the restaurant.  The chapter heading was 1970.  Hello?  Civil Rights passed in 1964. No place that I know of in the rural South would have been able to get away with that!  These errors became such glaring distractions that it really hurt the book.  Isn't one of the first rules of writing that you should write what you know? Toward the end I decided that the writer had a story to tell and she wanted to set it in the small town South so she could play up the prejudice theme so badly that she didn't even visit the area to get her details straight.  Prejudice is and has been everywhere.  You don't need to manipulate your setting to make sure we get your point.

A book with Great Hype does not make a Great Book. Crawdads is the perfect example. 17,000+ reviews on Amazon.com. A rating of 4.8. It has to be an excellent book. Surely. No. This is a poor book, flimsily constructed with weak characters and an implausible plot.Although targeted at adults, it’s basically a Young Adult Coming-of-Age Romance with only three characters. Kya, a girl who at six years old is abandoned by her mother and then a few years later by her father too and therefore has to fend for herself in the swamps of North Carolina. Tate (perfect body, dark eyes, golden hair), is a young boy from the local town who falls in love with her and teaches her to read. And Chase (perfect body, dark eyes, but DARK hair), is a young boy from the local town who falls in love with her and whose body is later discovered at the bottom of a fire tower amid suspicious circumstances. So who killed Chase? In a book with only three characters, and one of them is dead, that doesn’t leave a lot of room for surprises.The book is also totally unbelievable. Tate teaches Kya English when she’s 14 years old. A few years later, Kya walks into the town library and asks for the Principles of Organic Chemistry by Geissman, Invertebrate Zoology of the Coastal Marsh by Jones, and Fundamentals of Ecology by Odum! She then writes – and has accepted for publication – a scientific paper! This is not only implausible but a huge insult to researchers who have had to study hard for years to achieve the same goal.Moreover, she lives by herself in the swamp but never gets ill, never suffers from malnutrition, her boat never breaks down. The dialogue is trite and simplistic. Finally, the minor characters are so weakly drawn as to be invisible. So we have cops who, surprise surprise, like eating donuts, and a cliché-spewing “wise” African-American woman.I could go on, but I’ve wasted enough time reading this thing.

I'll even go as far as saying Where the Crawdads Sing is a very water downed knockoff of Ruby because of how many similarities there are between the two books.If you like trendy books with no originality then you might like this but if you're a book snob like me and know what good writing is then I would pass on this book.

There are people in this world who still reach out to others in love . . . and had the author taken that approach, it could have been SUCH a powerful and beautiful story!!","Very disappointing.

I loved the portrayal of Kya's sense of loneliness, betrayal, abandonment, and isolation.  I loved the author's ability to make the marsh come alive with abundance of life in nature's nursery which is a tidal estuary.  I loved the way that the author infused each character with characteristics which made each one come alive for the reader. It was possible to feel the abhorrent treatment that caused a mother to walk away from her own children. It was possible for the reader to take part in Tate's self-flagellation for allowing his own personal goals to come between him and the love that he felt for Kya.  It was extremely easy to feel the hatred and animosity that Kya felt toward Chase.  What was not to love about the realistic portrayal of Jumpin' and Mabel and the unbreakable bond that formed between them and Kya.  The author made all of her characters relatable and believable. Probably not since Rocky have I cheered for the underdog. Anyone who has ever experienced a loss in his/her life will become totally absorbed into Kya's triumphs and traSgedies.  At the risk of putting a damper on the enjoyment of this book by future readers, I will now issue a spoiler alert.  With the abundance of acknowledgement s at the end of the book, someone should have been wise enough to put this story in the proper geographic and chronological perspective. There is no way that a Trailways bus can get from Greenville, NC to the Atlantic Ocean in one and a half hours. The is no where that the marsh runs headlong into the Atlantic Ocean--especially where a small runabout can leave the marsh and motor directly into the ocean. There are hundreds of varieties of marine life in a saltwater estuary, but the break that were caught and eaten in the book could not have lived in saltwater.  They are a freshwater sunfish.  The time frame of the book is a decade too late. Separate but equal segregated schools no longer existed. It was no longer legal for restaurants to refuse entry to women and blacks. No longer could courthouses require the ""coloreds"" to sit in the balcony. And finally, and most grievous of all, there is not a single town in the state of North Carolina that is surrounded by the Everglades.","Right Story, Wrong Time Frame",Verified Purchase,36 people found this helpful

We are to believe that Kya's entire family deserts her as a seven year old and she survives alone in the marsh for the next eleven years. Mother, father, older brothers and sisters, all, one by one, abandon her and no one ever goes back to look for her. One brother was supposed to be especially close.

She makes a meager living selling mussels she gathers in her motor boat, which never breaks down or needs repairs. And how did the shack survive the hurricanes? She lives on grits without adequate nutrition or clothing, never sees a doctor or dentist, yet blossoms into a beauty who attracts not one, but two of the town's most desirable young men.

I didn't read that article until a few chapters into this book, when I went digging for background information on the author to see if I could quell the queasy feeling I got from her portrayal of black folks and race relations in North Carolina in the 1950s and 60s . I don't know what I was looking for, exactly, but ""currently wanted for questioning in Zambia, fled the country after they opened a homicide investigation in which her husband and stepson are implicated"" wasn't it. The anecdotes and background information in that article generally support my impression of the novel: the author's not necessarily a tiki-torch carrying white supremacist, but... well.Which is funny, because you can tell that she's really, really, really into To Kill a Mockingbird! The main character is Boo Radley, but prettier. There's an exchange of feathers and other treasures left in a tree (or rather, on a stump). There's a courtroom scenario involving an Atticus Finch stand-in. There's an underlying theme about the wrongs of discrimination. Against people who live in the marsh. Discrimination against people who live in the marsh is the subject of much moralizing; discrimination against black people (racial slurs, the occasional reference to segregated facilities) is just atmosphere. And you know, not every book has to be about everything, but if you're going to write a novel that takes place in the civil rights era, where black characters are your protagonist's main supporters, it might not be a bad idea to recognize that there are significantly worse forms of discrimination happening in your fictional world's setting than people viewing your main character with suspicion.And that's not even getting into the stilted dialogue, the screw-showing-I'm-just-gonna-tell-you storytelling, the bonkers character development, cringe-worthy love story, and the uneven plotting.I guess the nature writing was pretty, though, so...

Some spoilers under “the bad.”The good: The writing of this novel is phenomenal. There are rich descriptions throughout that transport you to the scene and make you feel like you are actually there. There is tremendous character development throughout the entire story and focused primarily on Kia and Tate but on many of the other characters as well. The plot is fast paced and keeps you interested and engaged (or completely obsessed as I was) from beginning to end. Theme wise, this book has it all; mystery, romance, adventure, plot twists, and a lot about science and nature. This really would have been my favorite book of the year up until the final chapter.The bad (spoilers ahead): I hated the ending. I had heard there were major twists and turns which are all a positive, but then the ending almost ruined it for me. The major reasons: 1. It was abrupt. It felt like it needed either an epilogue or some more time at the end because the way I read it came across as extremely rushed. 2. The author added in way too many sad events (no children, two deaths, and then Kias early death) on top of the “big reveal” that it made it feel over the top, not believable, and once again, rushed. 3. “The big reveal” yes, I had suspected this character initially but after reading the whole novel i really was incredulous. My theory was it was going to be Kia and Tate together, or else Jumper, or even Chase’s wife. It really didn’t matter too much who it was but it was the process of how we got there which was one of the highlights of the book. The way the ending was felt out of place, did not make sense to me, and I felt so let down after having finished the last page. Despite that, still an amazing book that I would recommend highly.“I wadn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.”“What d'ya mean, where the crawdads sing? Ma used to say that."" Kya remembered Ma always encouraging her to explore the marsh: ""Go as far as you can --- way out yonder where the crawdads sing.""Tate said, ""Just means far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters.”“There are some who can live without wild things and some who cannot.”","Mystery, romance, adventure, and nature pulled seamlessly together in this phenomenal story",Verified Purchase,22 people found this helpful

The prose was beautiful and the description of the marsh makes you appreciate it almost as much as the main character, Kya, does.  I was willing to suspend my disbelief at some of the unrealistic scenarios presented during this part of the book due to the strength of the author's description of Kya's desolate emotional world.  How does a six-year-old survive the harsh environment of the marsh on grits and mussels?  I reasoned that she could have picked up enough from her mother and Jody before they left.  Tate's fixation on Kya?  I suppose Tate's deep sense of loss after the death of his mother and sister could have created a strong sense of wanting to protect Kya.  And so on.But as the story went on, I became less and less willing to excuse the unrealistic plot lines as the story drifted less from a serious exploration of the effects of abandonment and loneliness to a sensational story that concentrated on very contrived plot twists.  For the first 100 pages or so, I had believed the book was a serious piece of fiction, but after I read more and more, it started to remind me of a Lifetime movie.  Lifetime movies are entertaining though, so I still read on with interest.It was about this time I realized how undeveloped the characters were.  The depictions of Jumpin' and Mabel in particular were bordering on stereotypical.  I kept reading and hoping there was some good reason for this mildly offensive characterization, but by the end, it is clear that these are throwaway black characters whose sole purpose is to make the white heroine look good.I give this book 3 stars based on the strength of the first 100 pages and its entertainment value.

Kya's comparison of the small-town prosecutor to the weaker marsh animals' antics to make themselves appear bigger, stronger, and more desirable was purely delicious. The marsh is the real star of this story, with plenty of beautiful, satisfying detail. The descriptions of Kya feeding the gulls made my heart ache with longing for that experience.Where the author fails pretty miserably is in trying to write dialogue in the vernacular. To do that well, a writer must pay close attention to consistency, which Ms. Owens does not. She has words and like sounds pronounced differently in the space of a single sentence, and more often than not, this reader was yanked right out of the story by the clumsy attempts at conveying an accent. Her rendering of the ""colored"" language was especially caricatured, to a painful degree. ""Gwine""? Really?

Three recent works that have done this for me come quickly to mind; “Night” by Elie Wiesel, “The Prince of Tides” by Pat Conroy and perhaps my all-time favorite, “The Pacific” by Mark Helprin. All literary masterpieces and penned in their own unique vision of what literature should aspire to be, all three evoke in me a sense of import and sublimity not remotely approached in other works of this genre. And now we have first time novelist Delia Owens, who has also seemingly captured this essential essence of literary beauty with this superlative work “Where the Crawdads Sing.” Herein, she seductively integrates a myriad of topical issues into one cohesive narrative…1960’s southern class divisions, controversial social orders, Jim Crow racism and male violence against women. With these, then, Owens seamlessly weaves a dazzling drama portraying one young woman’s segregated life as she goes from young abandoned youth to beautiful and intelligent mid-twenties young woman. Not to be forgotten, she also spins a twisted and dramatic murder mystery, one that succinctly converges with our main protagonist’s life at the end.Catherine “Kya” Clark is the acknowledged “Swamp Girl,” abandoned by her mother at eight years old (due to untold beatings and abuse by Kya’s father) in 1952 and soon by her last remaining brother (all siblings have left for similar reasons) and her deadbeat father. Learning to survive on her own in the Outer Banks region of the North Carolina swamps, Kya becomes one with the swamp, spurning any real integration with local society, even fighting off attempts by truant officers to get her into school. As she grows older, and as she sees and ultimately meets a local boy Tate out on the intricate waterways, she learns that the yearnings she feels for him is the beginning of love. Tate, feeling the same, becomes her savior of sorts, teaching her to read and sharing her love of the wildlife area. Owens is magnificent here, touching the reader’s heart with Kya’s coming of age experiences while describing her and Tate’s budding relationship.Tate leaves, of course, going to college following high school, breaking Kya’s heart, before she ultimately becomes involved with local football hero Chase Andrews, one who appears at first to be somewhat honorable but maintains a suspicious side, nevertheless. And this is where the book’s plot explodes…Chase is exposed as the murder victim at the very beginning of the book and Kya’s relationship is, shall we say, considered very suspicious. Owens weaves an intricate plotline, taking the reader through a maze of twists and turns while never losing her literary touch.Without divulging much more, everything, of course, works out well for Kya. I would caution the reader, however, to pay careful attention right to the very end of this book…that is how well Owens has dispensed this mystery.A work that is so beautifully wrought and so profound that you’ll be thinking about it and contemplating its affect for days, “Where the Crawdads Sing” is an immensely powerful novel that will literally stop you with its literary appeal. From page one, the reader is taken in with Delia Owen’s grasp of the human condition and its assimilation with nature while touching your soul with a young woman’s coming of age, you’ll undoubtedly count this book, as I now have, as one of those almost “spiritual” works that has come your way.","“Way out yonder, where the crawdads sing…”",Verified Purchase,16 people found this helpful

Of course, no one can endure this level of abandonment, isolation, and ridicule and come away unscathed.  Kya loves the Marsh and all of the living and non-living things within it.  It has been her home and her friend throughout the years.  And yet, there is something that Kya still longs for.  The desire for meaningful human contact is something we all experience, and Kya is no different. This is a story of resilience, survival, love, hate, and murder.  You will feel as though you are in the Marsh with Kya, seeing all the beauty of it through her eyes.  You will find yourself angry at the townspeople for their behavior, only to have your heart swell at the kindness shown by a few. Reading this book will definitely put some things in perspective, like the things that really matter in this life and how kindness and love is something we all need to thrive.",An amazing story!

From what I learned in the group, the author started with the ending and worked backwards, going back and forth from the ""present"" in 1970 to the past, going back to the early '50's.  It is a post-Depression story that we who didn't live in those times, don't hear. It is in part what happened to people who were displaced by the loss of income and home, those who had PTSD before it was a known syndrome in those who served in the military, and the separation of those who maintained their status vs those who didn't. Ostensibly it is the story of a child who learns to fend for herself, a murder, and the parts others played in the drama. But it is more.

Her mother flees, seemingly abandoning Kaya and her four older siblings. One by one, the siblings leave too, and while Kya's father works hard to be a better father, his demons are too strong. Abandonment is a recurring theme in this book.The story alternates between the time of Kya's mother's departure in 1952 and the year 1969, when the body of Chase Andrews is discovered at the base of an old fire tower in the swamp near Barklay Cove. As the book progresses, the reader discovers how these two lives—Kya's and Chase's—instersect. When Kya is befriended and taught to read by Tate, she is able to combine her love of words with her meticulous study of swamp wildlife to become a true authority on the area's flora and fauna, albeit without formal education. She and Tate become fierce protectors of their beloved ecosystem and then become lovers...seemingly too different to stay together yet drawn inexorably by their shared passions and values.Besides the author's remarkable descriptive skill, she shows a depth of knowledge about the spectrum of human emotion in her characters' behavior and dialogue.

Abandoned and left to raise herself, she doesn’t trust many people until Tate who teaches her to read. But just when love blooms, he leaves... and Kya is once again alone. Flash forward and the body of popular Chase is found and the marsh girl is thrust square in the middle of it all. The story flashes back and forth as we get to know what it’s like to be truly out of the norm.What’s good under the hood: it’s a sweet Nicholas-Sparks-like if that’s your thang! I wasn’t expecting that from the hype and description so it was a bit of a let down in the mystery arena but it’ll make a great movie I’m sure.What’s bad or made me mad: I wasn’t expecting chic lit and I wanted a stronger mystery/court experience. A child growing up without socializing would likely have severe mental impairments and need services, so that part rang fake as well as the fact that no one came for her. Also the mystery wasn’t even a mystery, truly. Eh.It also paints the justice system in NC as a bunch of backward hicks. The prosecution’s case is basically laughable.

I do not actively seek them out as reading material. This one has been at the top of the charts for SO long now, and the package IS pretty. My curiosity finally caused me to cave, and it was, pretty much as I anticipated, a 3-star read. Bestsellers usually are, for me. They're not terrible but they're designed to appeal to an average reader or to engage the predominantly non-reading public.This wants to lie in literary fiction on the scale between Uncle Tom's Cabin and To Kill a Mockingbird. I hated the first and can't remember if I ever finished the second. There, that's one of my ugly truths. Sorry.So how then, did it achieve 4 stars? The characters are type-cast, wonderful or mean. The writing is at times over-blown and caused severe eye-rolling due to syrupy sentimentality. The life-lesson wisdom is heavy-handed and the inclusion of poetry is just awful.I know, you hate me now.

The nature writing and descriptions of Kya's illustrations are beautiful.2.

I'm a big fan of Southern women writers, Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers being among my favorites.  At first I was pretty mesmerized, I must admit.  The plight of poor Kya and her family reminded me of the horrors of other, non-fiction books that have been recounted so brilliantly, like ""The Glass Castle"" and ""Educated.""  But as I read on, I found much of it to be unbelievable as well.  We are to believe that a six-year-old girl could survive on her own in the marsh without so much as a day's sickness, without medical or dental care, without being taken advantage of by drifters (the whole town knew about the ""marsh girl"" but no one came by to see her or, more likely, try to harm her?).  She is supernatural in her ability to subsist on grits and greens, and whatever she can get from her father's ramshackle boat.  The kindly African-American and his wife, who own a gas station/shack-store of sorts, are Kya's mainstay against the authorities, starvation, and almost everything else.  She lives illiterate and wild until a boy from the town, Tate, takes an interest in her and educates her.  Naturally, since she has a ""wild beauty"" (we never find out how Kya bathes or brushes her teeth or any of those other mundane details), he falls in love with her.  Of course she is gifted and highly intelligent, otherwise why would the book be worth reading?  I found the character development to be lacking as well.  The dialogue of Tate and Chase were so similar I had to keep checking to be sure which scene I was reading, and I didn't understand the use of the dialect.  ""Ya"" - is this particular to coastland North Carolina?  As for the murder/mystery part, that was so predictable I guessed it before it really started.  I sound harsh.  I do think for a first novel it is pretty good, but my favorite Southern writers have not been displaced in the annals of great fiction writers.  I made myself finish it because I had invested so much time in it.  There are also over-long parts about the marsh and marsh life that should have been edited.  I respect the author's knowledge but these sections were boring to all but a select few.","Good for a first novel, not up to the hype",Verified Purchase,7 people found this helpful

It's abundantly clear that the author is no low-country native: the dialect is forced and wrong: the characters are dropped in from some other, imaginary southern space: the geography is impossible. Even now, in the age of interstates, it is not possible or likely to make journies described as quick trips by bus  in less than half a day of high speed motoring. Nevertheless, those failures of Carolina nativity, so grating to the ears of actual residents, might well be overlooked by those spring break veterans with good intentions, and for them, the opening chapters are well worth the read. Our courageous and plucky gal is quite compelling. Less so is the plot forcing that juxtaposes her early abandonment with a decade-later police procedural. This too is forced: all that csi-evidence gathering and expert witness testifying is simply anachronistic. Fiber analysis was barely on the radar of major metropolitan areas in 1969: certainly, it was not being practiced by elected coroners (who were rarely, if ever, even qualified medical examiners) in remote, rural, Coastal east Carolina. But those raised on a steady diet of televised crime drama might hbe able to suspend disbelief there, as well.

Kya makes friends with local boy Tate Walker, a budding marine biologist who teaches her to read, “Jumpin” and Mabel, an African-American couple who help her in other ways, and is romanced by Chase Walker, star quarterback and the scion of the richest family in the nearby town.  There are two story lines:  the first follows her life from 1952 to 1969, and the second is a murder mystery set in 1969.  They merge toward the end, because Chase is the murder victim and Kya the prime suspect. The author has co-written three non-fiction books on African wildlife, and the sections of this novel dealing with the life forms in the swamp are excellent.

In “Where the Crawdads Sing,” she tells of an abandoned six-year old girl, Kya Clark, who uses her wiles and inventiveness to survive, as she grows up alone in the remote marshes of the North Carolina coast.  She is known as the “Marsh Girl” who hides in the backwaters with the creatures of the swamp, shunning interlopers and eking out an existence of hardship and hunger.  Her entire young life is a struggle, carefully delineated by an author who is sensitive to the emotions of her protagonist, the natural beauty of her surroundings, and the readers who travel with her through years of a lonely existence.Two boys interact with Kia.  One is sensitive to her solitary condition, teaches her to read, and kindles the first hints of love she will experience.  He suddenly disappears, along with her family members. turning her into a distrustful earth creature.  The other, the nearby swamp town’s charismatic idol, becomes her second lover, less caring about her personally, who drags the girl into the public eye as a suspect in his death.  He also breaks her heart before he is killed.  The story becomes more predictable at this point, and somewhat implausible, but a unique twist at the end saves the day.Owens, with a PhD in Animal Behavior, co-wrote three other books, about her experiences in Africa.  Crawdads is her first novel and, while occurring in a far different environment, it contains some amazing nature writing and descriptions of wildlife behavior.  Some have criticized her for leaning towards flowery writing about the natural world but I found it spellbinding.  I was less impressed with some other sections that tended to drag but, overall, it was a great reading experience.“Where the Crawdads Sing” is a beautiful and wistful title, bringing to mind the plaintive song “Somewhere Out There,” a tearjerker for sure.  Although this story did not wrench tears from me as a reader, I could never erase the image of longing and anticipation found in that song.  Kia’s mindset paralleled those emotions.  My appreciation for this book was certainly enhanced by having that concept in my mind.  It was an earworm that stayed with me throughout the book.  Marshy land, the swamp, green water, mysterious creatures, and black shadows are brought alive by Owens’s writing.  It’s an enjoyable read.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES",A PLAINTIVE AND ENGROSSING STORY,Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

But then I fail to understand how not one, but two ""eligible"" men fall madly in love with her. She has zero personality. She speaks in stilted, childish sentences. She runs and hides in the swamp like a cat scattering at the sight of a stranger—again, fine. She was a child abandoned in the marsh, she's going to be odd. But then what are these men so enamored of? Are they talking about anything with substance when we're not there to see it? Because Kya never achieved more than a seven year old's personality for me. The author failed to make the reader understand why Kya draws these people in and holds them there. She was boring ME to tears.All the characters feel the same to me. Nobody's motivations feel deep enough for me to buy that they're doing what they're doing. I didn't believe the mother's reasons for leaving and staying away. I didn't believe that she was paralyzed by fear to return and save her small daughter that she abandoned in a swamp at the hands of a madman. You call the cops, have them escort you to the shack, you take your kid. Done. The husband was a well known drunk. The mother knew that he'd leave for days at a time. Wait until he's at the bar and go get your kid. Done. Why was this so hard? Even if I bought her very convenient year-long mental breakdown, her sister was aware that small children had been left behind. The sister didn't facilitate a rescue mission? They write a polite letter requesting the return of the children and that's the extent of their effort?I didn't believe that Kya's siblings never came back for a decade, knowing they left a six year old with a drunk abusive father. I didn't believe that Tate or Chase had any ongoing interest in her. I didn't believe that the authorities would allow a child to continue to live in a swamp, alone. I couldn't buy the whole ""everyone leaves me so I'll never allow anyone to be close to me"" thing. It felt self indulgent and immature.The nature stuff was interesting. I did enjoy that.

Years ago I read a non-fiction book by the author, so while I didn't love this book as much as I expected to based on that previous read, I found many things about it to enjoy. The image of Kya's mother walking away stayed with Kya (and with me) for the rest of the book and epitomized abandonment and loneliness. I love books that trigger an emotional response, which this one did in several scenes. Owens' use of words was particularly riveting. Near the end, she writes: She closed her eyes at such easy acceptance. A deep pause in a lifetime of longing.What I liked less is you must suspend disbelief to continue reading. I found the story implausible. That a 6-year old girl could survive and thrive without help in the marshlands or in the later trial sequences the prosecution's case was so riddled with holes that the reasonable doubt issue screamed for recognition. Then, by process of character elimination , I figured out who had killed Chase - three-quarters into the story!Despite these issues, I was engaged throughout and enjoyed the story. It could have been a great book, as the author is highly skilled.

And while the story is told chronologically from the 1950s to the early 1970s, it bounces ahead in time to 1969-70 and then retreats to the 50s-60s until the two merge. While at its core, this is the story of Kya's lonely and alarming life in North Carolina's primitive and untamed coastal marshes (the '50s and '60s), it is also—around the edges—a murder mystery (1969-70).Kya, the youngest of five children, lives in a dilapidated swamp shack with her impoverished parents and siblings—until one by one, they leave. Shy and terrified, the abandoned Kya does what no child should have to do: survive on her own. This is the story of not only her survival, but also her triumphs and redemption. It is a story about prejudice, evil, abuse and hate, as well as a story of the transformative power of love.Bonus: This is also a love story to the coastal marshlands. The descriptions of the flora and fauna are so detailed and the imagery so vivid, that the reader can totally visualize the lush land and teeming waterways—if not actually feel the need to scratch at nonexistent mosquito bites! The book is filled with facts that are presented in such a fascinating and utterly interesting way, that I found myself wanting to know more about everything from female fireflies' bizarre and cruel mating habits to why seagulls have a bright red spot on their beaks and what creates the iridescence of a hummingbird's golden-red throat.This is a must-read book!",Ingenious!

This is definitely NOT a five star book. The story is cliche, the plot line is facile, the dialogue is rather silly and the conflict resolution predictable and contrived. This book reads like a bad TV series and is more of a romance novel than anything approaching a great new work of serious fiction. The book feels like the writer is writing FOR a specific audience and thereby sadly misses the mark of craftsmanship and great storytelling. Perhaps I am being unfair for what I am about to say but I am not at all biased against women writers. My favorite author other than Faulkner is George Eliot and I adore Jane Austen, Kaye Gibbons, Louise Erdrich and I think that the best short story author currently writing is clearly Alice Munro hands down. So I am not a ""sexist"" but I have to say that this book is strictly a ""woman's"" novel and has very little appeal for a male reader. All that aside the overriding impression of sloppiness in detail and triteness in the characters portraits renders this book totally banal and impossible to finish. I got to about page 200 and couldn't put my self through any more suffering.

The protagonist is a fascinating, mysterious girl, Kya, who is abandoned by her family, to grow up alone in the coastal North Carolina marshes. Kya turns to her natural surroundings to eke out a living, yet develops a fascination with the birds, the moss-draped oaks, the fresh water lagoons and the nearby saltwater ocean, the seashells, the winds, the grasses and wildflowers. At no risk of hyperbole, the author paints word-pictures which are vivid and memorable.The author’s description of the mannerisms, speech, and dress of the small town and rural folk, black and white, poor and less poor, is so accurate and honest, it almost hurts. And I feel comfortable making such a comment since I am a product of a small, Southern town. In fact, the author Delia Owens and I grew up in the very same South Georgia hometown.The lyrical descriptions of Kya’s close relationship with her natural surroundings and her more distant, even tortured relationship with others, would be enough to recommend this book. But I was caught off-guard by the exciting, even heart-pounding murder mystery, that intrudes and pulls Kya into it.

The setting--North Carolina marsh lands--are as much of a character is this book, as any of the humans. Told in vivid detail, this novel makes you feel like you're walking with Kya through the white sands, or following along deer trails under giant oaks, or sitting beside her in her small boat trying not to get lost.This is the story of how a young girl survives her abusive father, and a mother who deserts the family to save herself. Eventually everyone leaves Kya and from a young age, she learns to fend for herself--and Nature, who provides her with food, shelter and a family of birds, and animals. Kya grows up wild, and lonely, afraid to expose herself to the townspeople who have only looked down on her. She finds a few friends, Jumpin' a black man who runs the gas dock, and his wife Mabel who are the only ones who give her help when Kya's father finally disappears for good.What I found most interesting about this novel was how Kya learned about Nature at a PHD level, where if she'd had a normal upbringing--along with a public school education, she might have had an ordinary life. Because of her isolation, she learned to observe her world, and had the time--with no distractions--to record it. She became an authority on the Marsh she lived in, publishing books about her world.The author gracefully leads the reader to the answer as to who kills Chase--something we learn in the beginning of the novel--if the reader is paying attention. As I look back over the novel in my mind, I could see how it was the perfect ending.This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read--and it's a great 'who done it' novel at the same time.",A perfect blend of wonderful writing and great suspense.,Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

Unfortunately, it also got a little too hokey in the second half when the author stepped out of her area of expertise (nature writing) and into the unfamiliar territory of writing love scenes and courtroom scenes. The courtroom scenes are so implausible as to be laughable, and the romantic scenes unfortunately devolved the book into little more than a romance novel.It's books like these that really make me wonder what it might have been in the hands of a really good editor. I think better editorial advice would have made a book that was better researched for the courtroom scenes and also one that didn't rush to wrap things up at the end. The humanity of the characters seemed to be tossed out the window with ""this happened, then this happened, then this happened -- The End"" -quality writing. The whole thing seemed to wrap up in the last ten pages or so at a remarkable pace.I'm sure that finding the right way to end a book is one of the most difficult parts of writing one and sadly, this one dropped the ball.

Unusual setting, characters, and situations. The youngest child in a larger family is ultimately left to fend for herself in a shack in a marsh area in North Carolina. Her abusive and alcoholic father drives her mother away, suffering a nervous breakdown. The older children leave as soon as they can to escape the father's rages. Kya is left alone after some brief good times with her father teaching her to fish, at age 10.This beautiful story is about Kya growing up mostly alone, learning on her own and using the things she has learned from her family, such as how to operate the old boat. Living things have a strong survival instinct and Kya manages on a very limited diet for many years.The author is a wildlife scientist who has written nature books, and the passages about wildlife are lovely and intelligent. A couple of young men come into Kya's life when she's older.There are volumes of reviews online for this book, a few of which I read after I finished it. The critics seem to believe that factual geography doesn't mesh with the story. This is fiction, so I didn't worry about that. Readers who are extremely critical and think fiction must be correct in their world probably shouldn't read this book. Everyone else will likely enjoy it as much as I did. It's a memorable story and is one of those books that reminds us why we read.My grandparents lived in a tiny town south of Columbia, NC when I was growing up. Marsh land according to the map. That's a long ways from Greenville, NC but it's possible to get there in less than 2 hours. There is much marsh land nearer to that city and Pamlico Bay goes inland towards it, so for those critical of exact locations, even though this is a work of fiction, perhaps they don't have a clear idea of where this possibly fictional place might be located. The internet doesn't yield a Barkley Cove in North Carolina, of that spelling. And those marsh areas do have non-salt water in some places. Springs, rivers, streams, etc. that flow toward the sea, not the other way. Marsh land abounds in the coastal areas of this state, with barrier islands and peninsulas to the open sea.Readers, I wouldn't get caught up in what the critics say.

The dialogue, especially the bumbling police officers and legal characters, is amateur. The black characters are predictable stilted tropes, and the deliberately poor marble-mouthed language every black character speaks in is entirely othering. It may be a portrayal of the racial tensions of Civil Rights era small town NC, but the author seems out of her depth in conveying experiences that are not her own scientific imagination. Her descriptions of the marsh and getting inside the thoughts of a naturalist are convincing. That is the dominant setting of the book. But the narrative arc is fueled by trauma, and we are to applaud the main character for her perseverance and will, rather than be truly invited into her suffering. I found the book to be emotionally thin, the characters obvious, their conflicts and complexity lifted from other pages and dropped into a swamp. Here is specifically what I didn’t like: I never felt sad for any character. I never felt happy for any character. I didn’t feel at all transformed or different upon completion of the book, and the themes that are here are ample enough to achieve that. Instead, it’s a total 2020 refresh-the-browser morality play, this person is a bad person, this person is abused, this person is heroic, this person... etc. Our world is so complex, divided, unpredictable that this must feel like warm milk disguised as the mating habits of fireflies to a bunch of readers.

Mrs. Owen's book ""Cry of the Kalahari"" which she wrote with her husband, published in 1984, is one of my favorite books.  But ""Where the Crawdads Sing,"" ironically way more successful, fell far short for me.  While the prose is very readable, the plot is just plain goofy, the themes shallow.  I studied child development and no six year old can care for herself and stay healthy.  Kya spends, what, twenty years in almost perfect isolation but somehow comes out just fine.  The bad guy, Chase, is a cardboard, TV series type character.  Good guy Tate is just as one dimensional.  The court scenes are comically underwritten.  The final twist is telegraphed.  The crime at the center of the story is disturbingly brutal, a horrendous first degree murder that the author tries to pass off as justifiable revenge.  This book is, sadly, a light weight novel, a fantasy story, at best a quick knock off romance fantasy/half baked murder mystery.  It is certainly not serious literature.  Sad to see this book on the same shelves as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Prince of Tides, Cold Mountain, The Color Purple, Gone With the Wind, and dozens of other great southern novels.

Have no idea what happens after that (did she ever get out of the swamp, or grow up, or what?) so maybe it gets amazing later.  I had the sense this was the prologue to the child's later, adult story but if so it went on way too long.  I get it, okay?  She had a tough childhood.  If the child stays in the swamp for the whole book then I'm glad I quit when I did. Just felt the author was straining to make a  point that was already overburdened. It wasn't a story so much as a description of this child's awful circumstances. This made me not hopeful for the rest of the book so I quit.  A good example of how it can be done right is Angela's Ashes --- a great story about a really terrible childhood.  Depressing but a good read.  This one was just depressing.  Plus, felt this was not too realistic -- I live near swamps and a child running loose in one would die in about two minutes from water moccasins, alligators, quicksand, drowning, etc.  On the other hand, perhaps not a fair reveiw since I only read the first six chapters.

Not much I’m guessing, unless you want to get picky about a couple of things.  So that’s what I’ll do.  “Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens is a very nice story that really doesn’t need its flashback structure.  I thought that added nothing and often was a bit of a distraction, and unnecessarily confusing.  The story is about Kya, a seven year old girl, who is abandoned by her mother as a consequence of the Pa’s drunken beatings.  Really? – Mom abandons girl to Pa who has already hit the kid? Yet Kya is left with Pa and an older brother (older siblings had drifted off years earlier).  But a couple of years later the remaining family has disappeared and Kya is left with no money, no education, no friends, no nothin’.  And somehow survives out of sheer grit and reading lessons from an older boy who lives in town.Kya loves the marsh, and is known to the locals as The Marsh Girl.  She loves the critters, particularly the birds that cluster all about her when she tosses them crumbs at water’s edge.  But it’s not just the animals; she loves the insects especially the sexy fireflies, the grasses, the trees (great hiding places) and all the colors – interestingly no snakes(?).  She borrows books from her friend Tate, and even the University library.  She draws, paints and makes notes of what she sees.  And then writes a book, then another, then….Really(?)  And she has become a young woman, who speaks better than most college grads.  Really(?)Ok, I am getting a bit picky here.  After all, this is a story, a grand story and some things are real stretches, and I haven’t even gotten into the characters yet, some of whom are a bit too.  As in “too good”, “too mean”.  In some ways, this book reminded me a bit of “Gone With The Wind” – another great story, with some flaws, but a great story nevertheless.There is a very long, very tense well-done section toward the end of the book.  An excellent court room drama that spans about two months.  My only criticism of those chapters is that a central character seems to disappear unaccountably for most of the period.  Post climax, there is a quick summary of the next 30 years or so that I thought was unnecessary and a bit overdone (hankie material).  But that was the author’s choice and I can live with it.This is a debut novel.  I enjoyed the story very much and find Delia Owen’s background very interesting – a great fit for this story.  I am hopeful of more from Ms Owen.  Given the success  of “Where the Crawdads Sing” I think it will be a great challenge for her to write  something that will meet reader’s expectations.","5 star but I'll get picky, picky, picky anyway",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

She is the perfect woman— beautiful and somehow alluring in spite of her having acquired no grooming skills becoming of a woman in the 1960s, and healthy, in spite of having been abandoned at the age of eleven but also never having visited a hospital in her life.But leaving the progressive, anti-society premise aside, you would be mistaken if you expect to encounter a story here; this no story. This is wonderfully crafted prose, beautifully depicted scenery, a smattering of poetry, and a throwaway murder mystery that gives the semblance of a plot and climax, given that its resolution is predictable in one sense and non-existent in another.What I enjoyed about this novel was the prose. Owens thoroughly crafts an emotionally compelling world and an equally compelling protagonist to wander that world. What I did not enjoy about this novel is that all the protagonist does is wander. She does not fight for anything, not even her beloved marsh when the superficial society threatens to take it from her. She struggles for nothing. The men come to her, love her, and leave her. Her means of supporting herself comes to her effortlessly. I will stop short of spoiling the main “plot,” but it does suffice to say that her darkest hours come and go with no event, and her entire life seems to be a metaphor for that.Do not be fooled by the notion that this is a coming of age story. She never comes of age. She is the same at eleven years old as she will be at sixty-four. Also, do not be fooled by the notion that this is a murder mystery. There is no mystery. There is no a-ha moment. No one is particularly clever in the resolution of the mystery, and too, the mystery takes up so little of the narrative that it really does not have to be here. The society is indicted at the outset of the narrative, and whatever you are supposed to learn about them from the verdict does not change this indictment. Further more, whatever you think the outcome of the trial will be, you will probably be right.Read this for the beauty of the writing, for beauty’s sake.

At first glance it appears as though former high school football star, Chase Andrews fell from the top of the fire tower deep in the forested marsh. Upon further inspection, his death begins to look more and more like murder than an accident.Kya is the youngest of five kids in a family living in a shack on the North Carolina coastal marsh. Sadly, begins life with the cards already stacked against her; father is an abusive alcoholic and her family is extremely economically challenged. When it seems things are already about as bad as they could get, one day her mother walked down the driveway, out the gate and kept going. Kya was only six years old at the time.One by one, the rest of Kya's siblings left until it was just her and her father. With little to no parental help, love or guidance, Kya is left to maneuver the marsh and life in general alone. Kya spends a lot of time alone as she forges her way through life, trying to make sense of her world and to create a life for herself. Kya rarely goes into town, does not attend school, rarely wears shoes and becomes dubbed <i>Marsh Girl</i>, both a curiosity for the town and an outcast.Once a connection between Kya and Chase is established, who else besides town outcast, the <i>Marsh Girl</i>, would be the main suspect?<b>WHAT I LOVED</b>On the surface, <i>Where the Crawdads Sing</i> is a completely fascinating story of survival, which would be enough in itself, but it's so much more than that. Set mostly in the 1960's in a very small North Carolina town, this story, quietly has a lot to say about exclusion, discrimination and unfair assumptions based on preconceptions. It is about loneliness and the need for human interaction. In a large part, about forgiveness and love. All this without leaving the reader feeling like they have just been given a ""life lesson"" or being preached to.As an added bonus, the reader is treated to a glimpse into the wild life and ecological make up of an unblemished marsh.The final couple of revelations, in the very last chapters of the book were awesome. One of them made me like Kya much more.The most impressive aspect of this story is that this is author, Delia Owens, first novel.The cover is absolutely  beautiful! I feel like it captures the feel of the book perfectly.<b>WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE</b>This book was written in a style so lovely that it was almost poetic. The descriptions of the marsh, wild life, ocean and even the shells were vivid and beautiful. Most people would truly savour and <i>LOVE</i> those parts of this book. I know this says a lot about me, but I don't love it! I ended up skimming and skipping most of it. I kept wanting to get to the meat of the story.Partly due to the descriptions and partly due to the continued talk about Kya's loneliness, the first half of the book moves at a snails pace. That tends to drive me nuts. It felt like I spent the first 2/3 of the book waiting for the story to begin.Kya, the main character, seemed almost too good/ nice to be true. She should have been a little more three dimensional. Maybe part of that was the narrator's voice on the Audible version; she kind of made Kya sound breathless, bewildered and made of sugar. The majority of the book was sad and depressing. It started to weigh down on me after a while.<b>OVERALL</b>Although I didn't overwhelming love it like most readers, I cannot deny the fact that it's a unique and well told story.

Her father is an alcoholic who beats his wife and kids, a really dangerous  and constant threat.  They live in a hovel.  The premise of the story comes right at you after a few pages, and that premise almost had me put the book down.  All 5 kids and the mother are severely beaten or injured regularly, and one day, when the father is out cold from drink, the mother dresses up and leaves, alone.  Then the 2 older sisters take off, as do the two older brothers...just to get away from him.  The only two left are an 8 year old boy and little Kia.  The 8 year old, severely scarred by his father, takes off alone, too.  Kya at 6 is left behind.  She has no one and has to deal with cruel prejudice from the nearby township.  OK, so who in heck would leave a child that young alone?  That's the logical question to ask...that is the premise of this story...pretty much unbelievable.  But the descriptions of the land and the marsh and all of its creatures were so compelling and lovely that i kept reading.  So maybe the book is not a masterpiece, but to be on the best seller lists for almost 3 years certainly says the story appeals to many.  If you do not accept the premise of a tiny child left alone in wild country, if you cannot get past that idea and cannot go with the flow of the story, stop reading it.  I am not only glad i read it, but i finished it in 2 nights and this morning i had to reread the second half of the book about the murder investigation.  The author is a scientist and she describes the flora and fauna parts of the story so beautifully.  This is her first novel...and i hope she writes another, perhaps about another wild place.  I know they will turn this into a movie once this virus passes through and goes away.

It was just awful, and there are really too many criticisms to list. I nonetheless think it would be interesting to understand what it was that drew such a wide popular audience to this book, and what the significance of that is in terms of differences in economic and social backgrounds.This book really came off to me as a wealthy woman's fantasy of what it's like to be poor and living in a segregated society. I think my first bad feeling came when everyone from the main character's family abandoned her-- as a 7/8 year old-- and nobody bothered to check in on her for years!! And yet that main character has all these feminist flashbacks of her mom?? It makes no sense. With that kind of character development for the mom, it implies that the mom only abandoned her daughter because she was poor-- and that's a wholly insulting view of poverty. Furthermore, the idea that a young child could take care of herself, alone, by selling shellfish, is ridiculous. What about home and boat repairs? Clothing? Schooling?Finally, that super weird aspect of the geography revolving around coastal North Carolina and Asheville, which even today is an 8 hour+ drive from the coast, and who knows how long it was 50 years ago. It seemed like the author had a very loose understanding of Appalachia, the NC coast, and North Carolina in general, but maybe felt romantic ties to all three, so she wanted to write about them all in one book.","A romanticized vision of the ""magical"" life of poverty and broken families",Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

In fact, it may be the only book I have ever read in a single sitting. But I realized after I read it that the plot was basically stolen from the book I coincidentally read just prior to this one. The main character is alone and isolated.  A possible murder has occurred. The reader is lead to like and sympathise with the character who turns out to be the murderer. There is an investigation and the murderer is acquitted/gets away with it. The setting and the characters are different, but the most stunning parts of the plot are a ripoff from Rebecca by Du Maurier.  I initially thought Owens mentioned ""Rebecca"" in ""Crawdads"" because the main point of the book was a built on similar themes, but Owens never mentions this in interviews.  She just talks about isolation and how she percieves that it affects people, and in interviews, she presents herself as a kind of authority on the subject based on her experience observing animals in Africa. What about the genius plot and themes stolen from Du Maurier? Du Maurier nailed isolation and feeling like an outsider as well.  I liked Owens' book more than Du Maurier's (which was great).  It is goog, and she is talented. If Owens was presenting her work as a re-work of all the important elements of Du Maurier's Rebecca (which it absolutely is), I would applaud this, but I'm annoyed. Du Maurier was the genius behind this, but she never got anywhere near the credit, because she was a woman writer in 1938!","Du Maurier's genius, stolen!",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Ms. Owens draws pictures with words that rivals paintbrush on canvas. In fact, the book is one long canvas of beautifully written words, page after page. One can feel Kya's isolation and pain, smell the marsh grasses and palmettos all while sneaking peeks at Big Red. I grew up with the adage ""different strokes for different folks"" so not everyone will enjoy WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING. Unfortunately, it is a tragedy that reading the classics (in addition to more entertaining ""beach reads"") is no longer a requirement or is not as strong as it once was. Reading many voices and genres contributes to an appreciation that staring at text messages won't necessarily satisfy.To be clear this is fiction and fiction always, always requires some suspending of belief. In this book, there are no car chases or major escape scenes or near misses for the detective or blown up cars so if action-packed is what one enjoys, then this book doubtless would not suit those readers. On the other hand consider this small literary passage from WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING:  ""She stared at dust motes, dancing silently in one direction as though following some dreamy leader. When they hit the shadows, they vanished. Without the sun they are nothing.""I've seen dust motes many a time so I marvel that an author can give such personality to them! Of course, most of the beautiful words revolve around the marsh and its inhabitants, Kya, her family, her loneliness and her feelings and the townspeople not dust motes. However, that snippet is classic to how well written this book is all throughout. Of note Asheville is not as close to the coast as some other North Carolina cities but Asheville is surrounded by mountains, an attraction held out to Kya (a full day trip she is told), plus her paternal grandparents reportedly lived there (not a spoiler).The mystery is handled perfectly. But that mystery is only one element of the book. It is so much more than that. Kya is not the first young child (real or imagined) who had to (has to) survive against many odds: in Kya's instance, the erratic Monday money for food while still a child just to name one. Other discussion points such as whether or not it's fire flies or lightning bugs is so beside the point IMO since it depends on where one grew up. We called them lightning bugs but out of town relatives called them fire flies. They are the same insect and very entertaining to watch. Kya tells us much about these insects that I did not know and this information fit into the story. (BTW, there is a great show in the Smokies put on by lightning bugs (fire flies) during their mating season. People actually take chairs and go watch!)  Aside from quibbles about southernisms (LOL) some have, the book holds one's attention from beginning to end. The ending was perfect. It suited the book I believe. This book has earned its 5-star rating and I hope Ms. Owens writes another book soon.Finally, the descriptions of the marsh itself and its many inhabitants, including Kya, is worth the price of the book yet the reader gets all these bonuses: a mystery, human survival, human relations contrasted with extraordinary naturalist behavior and descriptions and an aching heart for all the Kya's of the world. Highly recommended for those who like a great story interwoven amongst beautiful, haunting words.

This novel read poetically and tied human behavior with that of the animals of the marsh. The marsh is metaphorically tied to everything and everyone throughout the novel and I really enjoyed that perspective. The author was able to give vivid detail of the marsh and all the life that calls it home.Kya’s character is really developed and we get to see her evolve from a small child to old age. Also, on the very last page of the novel, the author wrote a nice plot-twist that I didn’t expect and found myself literally laughing-out-loud.THE OK:The underlying love story. I feel like authors always lean on a love/romance story to get the audience interest. I don’t feel that Kya needed a love story but that’s just my opinion. I didn’t like or dislike it.Also, the story does not seem realistic. Kya is like Tarzan, living on her own in the wild from a young age yet finding a way to survive and become highly educated. This kind of read like a Disney film or a YA plot. I didn’t not like it but I wasn’t totally convince it could happen either.THE UGLY:I found that the black characters lacked depth and are only there to serve the white characters. Jumpin’ is mentioned throughout the entire story but we don’t learn anything about him besides the fact that he pumps gas and is married to Mabel. Mable’s character reminds me of a “mammy”— a large mothering figure that’s only around your help the young white girl. We learn nothing about their backgrounds or more about their characters even though they are mentioned throughout the novel. Kya even considers them her parent-like figures yet there is no character development of them besides the fact that they are around whenever Kya needs them to be. This is sweet but also I’m tired of reading black characters as only serving whites. Maybe I’m reading too much into that but I found it annoying.Also, it took me 100 pages to really get into this one. I thought about putting it down and getting a different book.

I’m glad I did. It’s the story of a young girl, Kya, abandoned by her family, who grows up in the saltmarshes of North Carolina in the 1950s virtually alone. Added to that, it’s a murder mystery surrounding the death of a popular and wealthy young scion of the local town. The stories are connected, but at first, you’re not sure how. You have to relax in the hands of this skilled author to know that they do connect. The main character of Kya, however, is the one that will stay with you long after you have finished the book.Kya is poor in possessions but rich in knowledge of the marshes in which she lives. She is ridiculed by the local town for her dirty, ragged appearance and hides from the authorities the fact that she is on her own. A local boy named Tate befriends her and teaches her to read. The black man named Jumpin’, who provides gas to the boats at the docks, takes pity on her after she tries to barter with him for her fishing catch repeatedly. He and his wife Mabel arrange for her to get donations from their church, letting Kya believe he is just trading things for her daily catch. Jumpin’, Mabel, and Tate are the only friends Kya has in the world.What makes this book remarkable is that it’s greater than the sum of its parts. There’s a love story between Kya and Tate, but also between Kya and the marsh. She knows birds by their calls. Kya spends her days studying the marsh, learning its secrets, and the creatures it harbors. The author, Delia Owens, not surprisingly, is a nature writer. I was caught up in her beautiful prose about the land and wildlife. She also captures the Southern low country dialect. I know I mentioned that it’s a murder mystery that adds tension and momentum to the plot. I would have been compelled to finish the book if only for the strong characters.

Her ability to watch and learn, and to depend on her North Carolina marsh allowed her to survive. When the handsome son of a prominent family is found dead, Kya is accused of his murder.  But was it an accident? Did she kill him?  Only with the help of others might Kya survive this, too.An author who paints pictures with words is one to be savored.  Owens does just that and does it beautifully.  There is a strong, lyrical quality to the writing—""Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.""The author does employ devices one may find annoying: multiple POVs and time fluctuations. Give it a chance, however. Before long, one may find oneself thoroughly captivated and willing to overlook those things.  Instead, one becomes immersed in a wonderful story filled with interesting characters, a setting which engages all the senses and emotions, and a desire for some real Southern cooking—""The aroma of sausage and biscuits, boiled turnip greens, and fried chicken thankfully overtook the high smell of fish barrels lining the dock. … Behind the counter, owner-cook Jim Bo Sweeny darted from flipping crab cakes on the griddle to stirring a pot of creamed corn on the burner to poking chicken thighs in the deep fryer…""Owens' descriptions are magnetic. She knows how to engage the reader—""There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.""  It is not all description.  The author creates interesting, strong secondary characters, including Jumpin', his wife Mabel, and particularly Tate—""His dad had told him many times that the definition of a real man is one who cries without shame, reads poetry with his heart, feels opera in his soul, and does what's necessary to defend a woman."" One also learns the meaning of the title, and celebrate Kya's successes—""I wadn't aware that words could hold so much.  I didn't know a sentence could be so full.""  Wouldn't one love to remember when one had made that discovery?Although there is a slight sense of fantasy about the plot, one can't help but be entranced by Kya's strength, courage, and perseverance—""I have to do life alone.  But I knew this.""  But it's not all misty light.  Owen's takes us into Kya's feelings of being confined and through the trial, which was well done.The book isn't perfect.

I enjoyed the first half despite the ridiculous scenario of a girl raising herself in a swamp, but it quickly devolved for me as there was more and more emphasis placed on the murder subplot. The plot was obvious from the beginning (including the ending), but I could have enjoyed the journey despite that if it hadn't meandered so much in the middle.I really didn't care about ""the victim"" so every part where the cops are investigating the murder are of little interest to me. The courtroom scenes were downright painful. Honestly, it felt like I was reading a different book entirely.What bothered me the most though was that Kya started out as such a unique character with a weird background yet was somehow simultaneously a cliche. She's a strong, self-sufficient tomboy which in it of itself is a bit of a cliche, but then she's also a secret beauty who everyone finds attractive and she doesn't even realize it. Yes, the girl starving in the swamp, crawling around in mud, and doesn't bathe is a super hottie - of course. Additionally she's incredibly intelligent and required very little help to become a scholar on her own. I don't have a huge problem with that part, but I'm kind of sick of the trope where every young, female protagonist has to be a girl who doesn't recognize her beauty, needs a cute boy to tell her she's hot, but it doesn't matter because she's super smart too.Additionally, her romance with Tate was a snooze for me. He was too much of a good guy stereotype. This is another trope in romance novels where the male love interest is such a gentleman that he loves the girl immediately and always (even if they have their issues/breakups), he is super concerned with her purity (no sex for you young lady until I tell you it's okay), and he seems to act more fatherly/protective of her than he does as a lover. I find this trope to be troubling because it reinforces this idea that girls can't have their own sexual agency unless a man gives them permission. Sure Kya ends up doing her own thing out of desperation regardless of Tate, but their romance felt cliched and boring instead of sweet as I assume it was supposed to be. Perhaps this is just a personal preference on my part though.I also disliked the phonetic spellings in dialogue. I get that the writer is trying to give us a sense of the dialect in the region/time period, but there was too much of it.The third person perspective also didn't work for me largely because it's constantly jumping around. At any given time you might be slipping in and out of multiple different character's heads within the same section. It was a bit confusing at times and made me feel disconnected from any single character. I don't mind perspective changing, but this book did it in such an unorganized fashion and spread to so many different characters that it detached me from all of them.All that being said, there are parts of this book that are well written with beautiful prose. There's something intriguing about the protagonist and her life, but I just didn't care about the overall plot at all. I would have been happier reading a story about Kya, Jumpin', and Mabel and left it at that.",Disappointing,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Known in town as only the ""Marsh Girl"" Kya has been alone in her family's shack since she was ten years old, her only friends the gulls and surviving with the kindness of only a trio of other locals. Kya's knowledge of the marsh and the life within it provides her a life that she loves and one she is comfortable in. As she grows, Kya begins to warm up to a new friend that she sees around the marsh who opens up doors Kya never thought possible. But as she slowly lets her guard down she becomes vulnerable to the dangers of the outside world that she has so carefully kept at bay for all these years. It's taken me too long to get to this book. I was nervous to start reading it based on all the hype, fearful that it wasn't going to live up to all of the positive praise I've heard. Thankfully it wasn't a disappointment.

The other was crazy about her, but was already engaged to a city girl.  He ends up murdered in the marsh and Kia is accused!

Although I realize that this is a work of fiction, the writing about the North Carolina coastal marsh ecology irked me.  As someone who is from the North Carolina coast, I found that most of the flora and fauna described are more descriptive of points further south, such as Florida. Most towns of any size are on the Sound, not oceanfront.  I have no doubt that the author has never been to the North Carolina coast, but she could have researched it. When I researched the author I was amazed to find out that she has written extensively about African wildlife and is a zoologist. With the great stretches of credibility (such as a fisherman who listens to Polish opera, or an illiterate, unschooled girl who orders a book on organic chemistry once she learns to read, and survives for years  pretty much on grits alone), I found this story to be annoying.

When I say alone--I mean alone. Everyone has abandoned her--her mother, father, brothers, sisters, people in the nearby town--everyone. This forces her to fend for herself in a primitive shack that has neither indoor plumbing nor electricity. Though initially a child, and despite lacking any formal education, she learns to observe nature's lessons, and that becomes the key to her survival into adulthood. Unfortunately, though the town completely shuns her, its sins will not leave her alone and she is eventually accused of murder. Where the Crawdads Sing accomplishes so much in such a short amount of time. It delves deeply into issues of domestic abuse, abandonment, discrimination, elitism, and hypocrisy. However, it is also a love letter to nature as it beautifully describes the vibrant activities occurring in areas most people deem uncivilized. Owens' writing is compressed, but extremely effective. She will make you feel like you're living in the marsh, coexisting with nature, right by Kya's side. Furthermore, there is a captivating murder mystery present in this book as well. Though it may sound out of place, it's not. Owens weaves the murder mystery into the overall plot perfectly. It never feels forced nor contrived. Between Kya's story, the murder mystery, and the convergence of the two, I couldn't put this book down.No matter what your taste, I highly recommend Where the Crawdad's Sing.

I do not enjoy or traffic in cheap critical shots (well, I try not to) for to sit down and write a story like this is not an easy task.My first reaction is that this story is desperately overwritten.  At the start the approach to establishing a sense and place resembled something more akin to  a Martha Stewart catalogue that features the perfect marsh experience a way down South(well not all the way to the Deep South).  A bit harsh, but I believe accurate.Then, this novel unwittingly morphed into a collection of inferior homages to numerous classic, southern novels by Faulkner, H. Lee, Carson McCullers, etc in a myriad of ways.. Finally then to only then dissolve into a feckless denouement, where law, justice, and community are paralyzed by prejudices and secrets that neither serve as resolutions or plausible outcomes to the acts of the primary characters, turning climatic impulses into anticlimactic ones.Again these observations are skeletal ones.  There are some flourishes of decent writing throughout the novel, that again only needs to be paired down; literary devices that need to be rained in, especially the impulse to wander off into poetic verse like a frantic Mickey Rooney as he breaks into a song and dance number; that is regardless of the big secrets revealed at the end.Someone referred to this book as something akin to magical realism.  Not even close, for those moments that seemed that way are just a narrative that has lost it linear tracking, and thus impedes the storytelling with often a recounting of events or character reactions to them that have rendered before in abundance.So, the editor’s pencil here was not a # 2.

It is harder still to believe that the mother gave up trying to get her children back after one lame attempt by letter, and I think it was out of character for Jodie to wait so many years to try and find Kya. She was right where he left her. Her love of the wildlife and marsh around her so-called shack was one of the most enjoyable parts of the story. Beyond that, it is just a little too outlandish to believe.The town was aware of the Marsh Girl but only Jumpin and his wife and Tate ever offered to help her. Even the school truancy officer was a year late and made little attempt to help this child. That is simply not realistic.  I just can't believe any community would sit back and knowingly let a child live by herself without proper food or clothing or education or medical care. I know I am harping on this point, but it is the premise of the book and it just makes no sense.  By all accounts Kya was beautiful and intelligent. Surely someone would have taken her in and loved her as their own.I actually liked the relationship between Kya and Tate initially, but it became a little bit too Blue Lagoon for me. It is admirable that he teaches her to read at 14, but her quick academic prowess is over the top.  He left her for over four years, though he apparently checked on her without her knowledge. It bothers me that throughout the book people came into her life but never really attempted to incorporate her into their lives. It's like discovering the castaways on Gilligan's Island but leaving them there. Tate could have invited her to his home to meet his father when they were still children or at any point thereafter. Both Tate and Chase treated her like some kind of side show or attraction.  The idea that Tate would leave for four years or more then end up living with her in the marsh in her childhood shack as they called it is just extremely unlikely and unbelievable.Some of the dialect and grammar in this book was appalling and even a little racist. As a southerner, I am often annoyed and even amused at how some authors portray southern dialect. It is so often over-the-top and really just laughable.What is the fascination with Asheville? It certainly is not the nearest major city to the NC marshlands.I really didn't mind the murder and subsequent trial like some readers seem to, but it was inconceivable to me that Kya could possibly be that appealing given that she was always barefoot, by her own definition her hair was wild and I didn't get the impression she had good grooming habits at all. That she became the love interest of two of the town's most handsome young men is just too over the top to believe.I could go on, but I think my point has been made. I wanted to love this book and there were parts that were excellent, but overall The premise was inconceivable.","I wanted to love it, but . . . .",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

And, to be fair, we must also look at the opposites: social status, especially entitlement,  lust, and ignorance. Kya is a product of a severely broken family with alcoholism and physical violence at its core. It does not surprise me that she finds more solace and peace in the marsh than at any other place. Kya's life is far from simple.As though her growth in this environment is not enough to keep a reader entertained, the novel includes a mystery: why is there no physical evidence around a body found in the marsh near the fire tower? The townspeople are shocked by the death of this young man, ""football hero,"" and ""all-around great athlete."" Is his death an accident? Who would want him dead?  Ms Owens, herself a scientist, understandably imparts a vast amount of information about the marsh. (Personally, I liked that!) But this author also draws characters and plot well.

I am sure this title calls out to others just as strongly as it did to me.  Only rarely, however, does the poetry remain consistent to the very last word.The Marsh Girl - Kya - is a mystery unto herself. How is it that a character can be thoroughly developed and described throughout hundreds of pages, yet remain inscrutable behind every word?Yes, the tale is of a possible crime.  A sheriff discovers a body and suspects a murder. The story interweaves the descriptions of  Kya and her life with the developments of the investigation and the traditional elements of an arrest and trial. And yes, that traditional story will nevertheless grip you and keep you devouring its arc as no other can.But interwoven with those dark threads are feathers - both literal and figurative - feathers of another story, feathers of a life so strangely different from that of any reader, feathers of a family of wilderness that drapes its wings around a little girl and protects her from human judgment. Those feathers only suggest the bird itself, never finally giving substance to the deeper reality of its nature. Kya is that bird, and while we can observe her and admire her, we can never completely understand her. Just as Kya’s books introduce her readers to a complex world beyond their superficial glances, Delia Owens gives us the Marsh Girl as a poetic invitation to experience nature as friend and family.","A Gorgeous, Gripping Mystery - and not just of a crime",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Kya had only one day of school in the North Carolina countryside. But it was so tramatic that she never went back.

Left to fend for herself at the age of ten and forced to raise herself in a small, rundown shack in the marshes of coastal North Carolina, Kya lived life in the shadows. Despite her deep longing to step into the light, past experiences taught her that living on the fringe was safer. Yet, the basic human desire to connect with others had a strong pull, leading her down a path that precariously straddled the line between being seen and remaining invisible.Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is, quite simply, a stunning novel. It is an incredible story of loss, loneliness, and the indomitable human spirit. Cast out by the community for her poverty and feared by children for being different, she ensconces herself in nature: the land, the water, and especially, the birds. With her identity so deeply tied to the land and sea, her two most reliable friends, it is impossible to tell where she begins and nature ends.Yet despite the cruelties fate handed to her, there are some who see her and gift her with kindness. It’s impossible, after all, to survive completely alone, particularly at such a young age. Two young men, in particular, bestow her with the attention she craved all her life. But as with all matters of the heart, things are not quite what they seem, and Kya learns firsthand that for each action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Still, it was the small kindnesses of strangers that brought tears to my eyes, but it was the equally small cruelties that had me holding my breath, hoping for a miraculous change in circumstances.Where the Crawdads Sing is notable for its unforgettable protagonist who proves that the human spirit can withstand nearly any obstacle, not to mention its lyrical beauty. But what is truly outstanding is how Owens manages to get to the core of humanity: the need to be seen and the need to connect (Sugar Run is another book that does this well).With all that said, I would be doing the author and the book a disservice if I didn’t also take care to discuss the richness of the setting, which feels both real and imagined in its magic. This is a book that blasts the senses: I could smell the sea, feel the crunch of the leaves under my feet, and hear the vibrations of boats coming into the lagoon. It bears repeating that it’s impossible to see where Kya begins and nature ends, for they are so intertwined that one cannot exist without the other and is evident by the way the author seamlessly blends them together and the story soars as a result.The result is a stunning novel of utter beauty in every way possible: its damaged and lovable protagonist, its descriptive scenery, and the shocking way the story unfolds. It’s easy to see why this one rocketed to the top of the charts and I am already eagerly awaiting her next book.",Where the Crawdads Sing and the Resiliency of the Human Spirit,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

One does have to remember the story is fiction and be able to suspend belief…for initially, I had difficulty accepting this child (Kya) was basically abandoned at age five by her mother and each of her siblings, and left alone to live in the swamps of North Carolina with an abusive father. Once that was accepted, I fell in love with the descriptions of the swamps and was intrigued by how this little girl grew and survived on her own, with some help from native people. As a teacher, I loved how a friend teaching Kya to read opened up the world for her and allowed her to know and understand her environment and surroundings intimately. This, combined with her natural talent as a watercolor artist, helped her capture all she saw. This ultimately leads to a source of income for her, and supports her survival in the swamp. There are two men with whom Kya becomes involved…one good, one bad, of course. Near the end of the book, Kya goes on trial for the murder of the bad one. This is an interesting and detailed trial and I literally slowed my reading for I was nervous about the results.

While I was reading, I forced myself to suspend disbelief and ignore some major lapses, whether the fault of the editor or the author, I'm not sure. But now that I'm writing a review, I have to point out these failings.  Tate's decision not to contact Kya after he returns from college is completely out of character for this empathetic young man. I don't care what reasons the author supplied for his decision, he wouldn't have done it. At the very least, he would have met with Kya and explained his feelings, giving her the opportunity to agree or disagree with his assumptions. At this juncture they could have tested their relationship with problems arising as he had predicted or they could have stopped seeing each other by mutual agreement. Leaving Kya out of the decision entirely should have been unthinkable on his part. Unfortunately, the author uses this plot point to deepen Kya's sense of martyrdom (everyone abandons me) and send her on a collision course with Chase. Using the approach I have suggested could still lead to her liaison with Chase, but in a more realistic manner, rather than what seems like a trick that the author has devised.  Next, having Kya appear almost comatose or disembodied during her trial is another trick on the author's part. Because Kya did kill Chase, she can't be thinking about the crime during the testimony or she would reveal to the reader that she is guilty. The author wants this ""minor"" detail hidden until the big finish of the novel when Tate discovers Kya's hidden cache of incriminating objects and realizes that his wife committed the crime. I would, in fact, have let her think about the details during the testimony--with her thoughts paralleling the sequence of the trial--creating a major climax for the reader, who never really gets to read about Kya's planning or the graphic details of Chase's demise. Her acquittal would then immediately follow, giving even more impact to this approach. The ending of the novel would be the same, as Tate discovers for himself what the reader already knows, enhancing the dramatic irony of the narrative.  Finally, the diction of the characters is comical at times, their vernacular at odds with my own close experiences with native North Carolinian speakers (my son-in-law and my frequent travels in the state). I must also mention that Kya, described as a great beauty, never visits a dentist or doctor in the novel and spends a great deal of time outside exposed to the sun and elements--of course, this is part of the pleasing fantasy of the narrative.",Where the crawdads play tricks,Verified Purchase,

Overall, this was a very fun escape into a different time and landscape. The writing is beautifully descriptive without being too heavy-handed, and the story is reasonably well crafted.It starts early in Kya's childhood, when most of her family abandons her in the extremely rural salt marshes of coastal North Carolina. Kya is smart and resourceful, and the reader is dragged through her many injustices (mostly brought upon by abusive men) and her eventual triumphs. Her deep love and respect for nature really resonanated with me, bringing to mind my own childhood running through the countryside and reading wildlife encyclopedias. She appreciated the beauty and life of the marsh, and as a reader I got lost in it, too.Interspersed are chapters set in the 'present', when a young man's body is found and a murder investigation ensues. The timelines eventually converge in the latter half of the book, though many kept details are purposefully left out until everything is wrapped up quickly in the last chapter.This is a work of fiction, so I was able to suspend the questionable reality of a six year old suriviving alone, or her ability to learn how to read so quickly as a teenager.

Owens, a zoologist by trade, weaves together a strong narrative of a lonesome girl on the edge of civilization with the behavior of animals in the wild. The connections are undeniable and as the story unfolds, we see more of how human behavior is similar to the animal kingdom and that at our very core, we are more animal than we think we are.This book teaches us that saving our environment, especially our wetlands, is vital to the future of our planet. Respect for other species, as well as other human beings, is being torn apart in today's world and we need to re-connect with nature and each other.This story shows how far we have come in terms of civil rights since the sixties but also how we have, by our mere growth in population, pushed wildlife back.This book also teaches how men and women, black and white, people and animals, need to respect each other.I found this line to be the most important in the book: ""...his dad's definition of a man: one who can cry freely, feel poetry and opera in his heart, and do whatever it takes to defend a woman.""

The evidence: I read it almost all on one of those lazy, cold Saturday mornings when I allowed myself the indulgence of putting off working, house-cleaning, bill-paying, cooking, and curled up in bed with a heating pad on my feet. I read till I had to admit that I was starting to doze off, even though it was getting to the good part—the denouement, the reveal about the murder mystery.  When I woke up the next morning, I immediately reached for the book and didn’t get out of bed until I finished it. I just HAD to find out how it ended!It was a compelling read, and yet it vacillated between being a fascinating character study and a somewhat cliched romance novel. The main character, Kya, is basically orphaned at age seven, as every one of her family members gradually abandons her—a mother we only get glimpses of in Kya’s memories, a mostly drunk father who beats the joy and the tar out of everyone in the family when under the influence, and all of Kya’s three older siblings.And yet, this tough little thing figures out how to survive, in large part due to the fact that she is truly one with nature. Nature is not just a backdrop to the story, but it is the very essence of the character Kya. She observes nature, collects its artifacts, especially bird feathers and shells, and records her findings—this despite the fact that she does not learn how to read until she is almost a teen-ager. Instead, she draws and paints as a way of recording what she finds. In other words, she is a natural scientist, not unlike the author, Delia Owens. Kya even figures out how to make a living from nature by fishing and gathering mussels and selling them to a local, who becomes a father figure to her.The short bio accompanying the book says that Owens is a zoologist with a Ph.D. in animal behavior, and coauthor of three internationally bestselling nonfiction books about her life as a wildlife scientist in Africa. She now lives in the mountains of North Carolina. The book is set in the coastal wetlands of North Carolina, in the marshes. The main character is called the “Marsh Girl” by the many backwoods, small town, redneck-like townspeople who populate the book. It’s hard not to get the feeling that the Marsh Girl is a stand-in for the author, at least in the areas of study that interest the author.Of course, the Marsh Girl triumphs in the end—thanks to an unlikely suitor, a sympathetic young man who teaches her how to read and seems to understand that she is a skittish as a wild animal. He’s her childhood sweetheart before she even knows what a sweetheart is. By the end of the book, the Marsh Girl has not only learned to read and continue her inclination to observe, collect, gather and organize the world of nature around her, but she becomes a regional publishing sensation, the author and illustrator of dozens of books profiling the minutiae of nature in all its forms in the marshes of North Carolina—the birds, the plants, the mushrooms, the shells.A good narrative can’t be without conflict, however. In this story, the Marsh Girl’s outsider status figures prominently, not just in her lack of social standing and social skills, and her conflicts about how to interact with the small community she lives near, but even more so in the men who enter and exit and re-enter her life. It’s these men who are the less credible characters in the narrative. One is a savior, though not exactly a saint, who not only shares Kya’s love of nature and pursues it as a post-doctoral career, but he (and his father) have an appreciation for poetry and opera. The other is a somewhat stereotypical example of a “frat boy”—the kind of guy who has to brag about sexual conquests, even when there’s been no conquest; the kind of guy who will say anything to a girl just to get in her pants.What keeps you reading, besides wanting to find out the story of this unusual, resourceful, fascinating young girl, is the murder mystery, hints of which are woven throughout the book, but culminate in a trial. I couldn’t possibly spoil the ending for those who haven’t read this book yet. But let me tell you—it was totally unexpected!",Memorable main character and setting,Verified Purchase,

That wasn't enough to get me to the unbelievable parts noted in other reviews. It was enough to get me to irritated.The ""accent speak"" was exagerated and not representative of speech in the Carolinas. Nor any part of the South actually.Also the location of the story seems to be off. I'm not from Carolina, but do have friends living there. The wetlands are inland from the shore. Either more research needed to be done regarding the Carolina geography and ecosystems or the location needed to be fictional.Even at a reduced price, the three chapters I read were not worth the time wasted.

In other words she was writing about what she knows, and she hit the jackpot on her first outing. It has been at the top of the New York Times best-seller list for at least six months.Kya Clark is the “Marsh Girl”. She has several brothers and sisters, but they all leave her because of their drunken abusive father. When her mother leaves also, she is all alone with him. Surprisingly she begins to get along with him until her mother writers a letter; she can't read, and she makes the mistake of giving it to him. He tears it up and reverts to his old behavior. Eventually he disappears as well, and she's left alone with her friends the gulls and the owner of a small gas station, a black man named Jumper who trades gas for her boat her father left behind in return for mussels she collects. She also meets a boy in the estuary. She's just a little girl, around seven, and he helps her find her way back to her shack. He leaves rare feathers for her on a stump in the clearing, and they become more than friends. But he leaves her, too, going to college where he doesn't see her fitting in, although she's very smart. He teaches her how to read and do arithmetic.Then she meets the wrong guy, Chase Andrews, who's a lady killer. He promises marriage, but he eventually marries another girl. He still won't leave her alone. When he turns up dead, falling from a fire tower, Kya is the principal suspect. Two witnesses see her racing toward the fire tower. But there is no evidence. All the foot prints and finger prints have been wiped away. He could've accidentally fallen from the tower. She also has an alibi.You will cheer for Kya. Nobody's mother leaves a seven-year old girl with an abusive drunk. Her boyfriend Tate is a decent guy, who realizes he made a mistake, but she has trouble forgiving him. Later on she says, “We don't need to get married; we're like geese.”The ending is a shock to the system.

If you’ve seen my usual book choices, you can see that it doesn’t exactly fit in with my book choices, but I wanted to give it a fair shake. I read this as a kindle read so as I provide this review, I’ll be giving percentages instead of page counts to talk about how I felt as I read along.To be 100% honest, I almost DNF’d this book around 23% through. I was BORED. I get the appeal of a girl and a place. I truly do. But that’s not my story and there are too many books on my tbr that ARE my story. But, it was for book club, so I kept going. There was an element of crime drama and the non linear storytelling that I kinda liked, so regardless of whether I liked Kya or not, I kept reading.But then it got so, so, so predictable that by 50% I did DNF it. I was totally done with it, book club be damned. I was 100% sure I knew how the crime plot was going to shake out, I didn’t have any strong tie to Kya or Chase or Tate or anyone else, except for maybe Jumpin.The one thing I didn’t count on was being shamed for DNFing it at book club. I thought I had enough to speak on when we started talking about it… (50% is a LOT to talk about AND I’m an English major and an English teacher tyvm) I guess by me not finishing it in the first place I was bashing the pick of it? Or maybe I made my opinion of it too well known, but anyway, I was made to feel guilty enough that I went home and stewed over finishing it so much that I did just that!I finished the dang book. And you know what, it was exactly what I thought it was going to be. The crime plot shook out exactly as expected, the good guy was the good guy, the bad guy was the bad guy, the the marsh was the marsh.Here’s the good:Delia Owens is a beautiful descriptive writer. Her description is out of this world. She created the marsh as it’s own character and imagery is her god damn forte. Holy cow can she paint a picture.Here’s the not so good:It felt predictable from the start.Maybe it was supposed to. Maybe you’re supposed to guess it from the beginning. This wasn’t for me.I just felt like I wasted my time.

The writing was solid, but this book dragged. One reason was the constant time switching. I'd be immersed in one story, then the book would abruptly jump ahead or jump backward. It was distracting, and I couldn't help but feel it was a device to quicken the pace. It didn't work. The story itself is odd. Spoiler alert: A child surviving alone in a swamp while the entire town is aware of it, AND her mother and mother's family is aware that she is in dire straits, too, but does nothing to help her. Honestly, once the trial was over and I saw there were another 35 pages to go, I skimmed the inevitable, predictable ending because, let's face it, Chase Andrews wasn't the type of guy to go wandering around the marsh alone for no reason, nor was he the type of guy who'd decide to climb the water tower to be alone. Someone had to be there with him, and only one person made sense. Of course, we never got a look at his friends. His wife was a fact not a person in this book.

I loved the apparent knowledge ostensibly proffered by the author regarding the low country and its diverse flora and fauna which were more than incidental to the meaning of the book overall.  Although the development of the protagonist was a touch unlikely given the limited resources available to her, the story uplifts the reader in many parts, while in other parts there is a shocking disparity in the nature of the action in the story.  So, the author intertwines various values along with the hopes and the disappointments of the protagonist as she toils to find the meaning in her life, and her success is readily admired by the reader.

Kya's life alone in the marsh was fascinating, and I enjoyed the details about the rich ecosystems there, which are unfamiliar to most of us.  The murder drives the story and adrenalizes the pace.  However, I found it hard to believe that someone with such limited human contact or caretaking as a child would have even the awkward communication or social skills that she is given in the story, which even her extensive reading would not have made possible with such limited life experiences.  I was also skeptical that she would be beautiful in any recognizable sense with nonexistent hygiene or dental care!  And I never believed [spoiler alert] that she would be capable of calculated murder, given the way her character has been developed as a sweet and gentle soul. It seems that the author is justifying first degree murder as an acceptable punishment for attempted rape, when the actual message of the novel, despite her glorification of Kya's solitary life in the wilderness, is that such an antisocial way of life produces  psychopaths, and therefore the villagers' suspicions of her were completely justified all along.",Page-Turner,Verified Purchase,

Catherine Danielle Clark, aka Kya, is abandoned in severe poverty in a marsh near the fictional village of Barkley Cove, North Carolina as a child and uses her wits to survive.  She grows up as one with the marsh life, although she is not quite feral due to her upbringing by her mother to the age of six and the help of a few friends who take her under their wing.  Although shunned and scorned by the villagers who call her “the marsh girl” Kya is extremely intelligent in spite of having attended only one day of school in her life.  She eventually earns a living in a most surprising way given her lack of formal education.  The best thing about this novel is that Kya is never a caricature; she is clever beyond the ability of everyone, including the reader, to fully grasp until the end of the novel.  This novel is a sad reminder that isolation and abandonment in early childhood can weave itself into a person’s DNA in a way that is very difficult to fully heal.  One of my favorite things about this novel is how the marsh land and marsh life become a character in the book and how Kya seems to take her life lessons from the behavior of the insects and birds.

An uneven work, it sometimes reads like a young adult novel with lots of coming of age hormones and melodrama; but it also is a beautiful work of art depicting the pain of loneliness and and the consequences of reclusive behavior.  At the age of six, the heroine, Kya, was abandoned by her family and left alone to survive in the backwoods’ marshes of North Carolina in the 1950’s. Time after time, human beings have disappointed her, so she finds solace in the natural world of the marshes. Living on the margins of society, she is treated like the town pariah. Her mistrust of people and her lack of self-esteem isolate her physically and emotionally. Her plight wrung the empathy right out of me. When a town’s young man, a former athlete, mysteriously falls off a large tower, Kya comes under suspicion. What happened to her family and the athlete create quite a page turner. However, this novel begs for its readers’ willing suspension of disbelief.

What I liked most about this fine novel is the writing style.  The author's style is picturesque and has a flow to it.  It is clearly written, but is not a light read.  It is the kind of book I needed to give my full attention.The story involves two separate time lines that slowly weave together.  The protagonist is a young lady who has a difficult childhood and who learns to cope with life on her own terms.As I stated above the writing is often exquisite.  Although very good, the story itself is not quite as good as the writing.  But the writing is so great that for the story to be as great as the writing would make this one of the greatest novels ever written.  I would not go that far.  But the book overall is excellent.As is often the case I listened to the audiobook while simultaneously reading the book on Kindle.  The narrator is Cassandra Campbell.  The audiobook is as excellent, and is worthy of the writing.  I have what I refer to as a ""flawed inner narrator"".  As such the audiobook was really worth the extra expense to me.****  Above, I have tried to avoid references to the story, one may wish to skip the below until after reading the book. ****If one has already decided to read the book, one may wish to skip this part.  I will try to remain vague.There were parts of this story the seemed unlikely to me.  When one parent departs and goes to her family, they seem to make no attempt to find her children.  As a grandfather, this is unthinkable to me.  Supposedly there were some threats.  That would mean nothing to me.There is also a violent felony mystery within the story.  As a retired detective, there were parts of that episode that I found completely outside my personal experience.  I am not saying the matter could not be resolved, but they did not even come close.  It is not that really amateur hour police work never occurs, it does.  But a case that weak does not go to trial, especially with the potential penalty involved.  It was more like a civil trial than a criminal trial.  I suppose those were the parts of the story that were most unrealistic to me and bothered me the most.It is the WRITING that I found most compelling.  And most of the story is really quite good.***** End of discussion of the story itself.  *****In summary, I felt this is a really great reading experience.

They are also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, mountain lobsters, mudbugs, or yabbies. Taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills.” Perhaps more than you needed to know?Next I wanted to know something about the author, Delia Owens, beyond what I’d learned from the CBS Sunday Morning piece about her, on March 17, 2019. She was the co-author, along with her then husband, Mark Owens, of three non-fiction books, “Cry of the Kalahari”, “The Eye of the Elephant: An Epic Adventure in the African Wilderness” and “Secrets of the Savanna: Twenty-three Years in the African Wilderness Unraveling the Mysteries of Elephants and People.”The Owens lived as young wildlife scientists in Africa for over two decades. This experience of isolation and delving into the minute details of animals and their behaviors, would later be the germ that grew into her first novel, “Where the Crawdads Sing.”Delia Owen’s early life was also influential in her later writing. She was born in Southern Georgia and her family spent some of every summer in the mountains of North Carolina (the novel takes place in rural North Carolina from1952 through early 1970’s). Owens says that her mother would often encourage her, “to explore far into the oak forests, telling her, Go way out yonder where the crawdads sing.”She also taught her how to avoid stepping on snakes and to not be afraid of any critters.  Along with the isolation, the oneness with all of nature surrounding her, would come to embody Owens’ protagonist, Kya,  in “Where the Crawdads Sing.”The first main element in the story is the descriptive Language, describing the natural surroundings of the pristine coastal marshland of North Carolina. “Marsh is a space of light, where grass grows in water, and water flows into the sky.”“Swamp water is still and dark, having swallowed the light in its muddy throat.”“Life decays and reeks and returns to the rotted duff; a poignant wallow of death begetting life.”“Light lingered after the sun, as it does, some of it pooling in the room, so that for a brief moment the lumpy beds and piles of old clothes took on more shape and color than the trees.”“The darkness held an odor of sweetness, the earthy breath of frogs and salamanders who’d made it through one more stinky-hot day. The marsh snuggled in closer with a low fog, and she slept.”“syrupy sand”I could easily write this entire review by simply using the copious examples of the gorgeous, sumptuous and sensual language of he novel. For me, it is this ability of the author that makes the difference in rating it with three stars or four (occasionally five) stars. If I love the language, I generally love the book.The novel offered not only stunning language, but also a pretty good mystery, that for me became increasingly moreintriguing as the book progressed nearer to the end. Some people, when they read mysteries are very good at solving them. I am not one of those people. Consequently, I was thrown for a loop. I am not a mystery reader in general, but I liked this one.“Where the Crawdads Sing” is about a girl, Kya, who the small community living in Barkley Cove, not far from the marshland, like to besmirch by referring to her as “the marsh girl.” She lives with her family, consisting of Ma who is loving, but besieged by her often violent husband, Pa, brother Justin, two older brothers and two older sisters. Ma flees her abusive husband when Kya is only 5 and one by one, all the others also leave the rickety shack which is their home, leaving Kya all by herself at the age of 6. She slowly learns how to survive alone in the marshland wilderness and by so doing, she comes to understand and appreciate the marshland with all its creatures living and breathing within it.I will summarize the story line through the use of quotes taken from it:“Maybe it was mean country, but not an inch was lean. Layers of life—squiggly sand crabs, mud-waddling crayfish, waterfowl, fish, shrimp, oysters, fatted deer, and plump geese—were piled on the land or in the water. A man who didn’t mind scrabbling for supper would never starve.”“When light from the quarter moon finally touched the shack, she crawled into her porch bed—a lumpy mattress on the floor with real sheets covered in little blue roses that Ma had got at a yard sale—alone at night for the first time in her life.”“For the first time ever Kya walked alone toward the village of Barkley Cove to buy groceries—this little piggy went to market. She plodded through deep sand or black mud for four miles until the bay glistened ahead, the hamlet on its shore. Everglades surrounded the town, mixing their salty haze with that of the ocean, which swelled in high tide on the other side of Main Street. Together the marsh and sea separated the village from the rest of the world.”“So the only intersection in town was Main, Broad, and the Atlantic Ocean.”“Mostly, the village seemed tired of arguing with the elements, and simply sagged.”“Barkley Cove was quite literally a backwater town, bits scattered here and there among the estuaries and reeds like an egret’s nest flung by the wind.”“She’d never gone to Colored Town, but knew where it was and figured she could find Jumpin’ and Mabel’s place once she got there.”“CHASE ANDREWS, you get back here! All three of you boys.” They pedaled a few more yards, then thought better of it and returned to the woman, Miss Pansy Price, saleslady in fabric and notions.”“We’re sorry, Miss Pansy, we didn’t see ya ’cause that girl over yonder got in the way.” Chase, tanned with dark hair, pointed at Kya, who had stepped back and stood half inside a myrtle shrub. “Never mind her. You cain’t go blamin’ yo’ sins on somebody else, not even swamp trash.”“It’s my birthday,” she told the bird.”“But Jackson mostly ignored crimes committed in the swamp. Why interrupt rats killing rats?”“Kya never went back to school a day in her life.”“Months passed, winter easing gently into place, as southern winters do. The sun, warm as a blanket, wrapped Kya’s shoulders, coaxing her deeper into the marsh. Sometimes she heard night-sounds she didn’t know or jumped from lightning too close, but whenever she stumbled, it was the land that caught her. Until at last, at some unclaimed moment, the heart-pain seeped away like water into sand. Still there, but deep. Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.”“Sheriff Ed Jackson”“Deputy Joe Purdue”“Well, obviously, on the surface, it looks like an accident: he fell from the tower and was killed.”“Saltwater marsh, some say, can eat a cement block for breakfast, and not even the sheriff’s bunker-style office could keep it at bay. Watermarks, outlined with salt crystals, waved across the lower walls, and black mildew spread like blood vessels toward the ceiling. Tiny dark mushrooms hunkered in the corners.”“They sipped until the sun, as golden and syrupy as the bourbon, slipped into the sea.”“Hey, Kya. Sorry I couldn’t get here sooner. Had to help my dad, but we’ll get you reading in no time.” “Hey, Tate.” “Let’s sit here.” He pointed to an oak knee in deep shade of the lagoon. From the rucksack he pulled out a thin, faded book of the alphabet and a lined writing pad. With a careful slow hand, he formed the letters between the lines, a A, b B, asking her to do the same, patient with her tongue-between-lips effort. As she wrote, he said the letters out loud. Softly, slowly. She remembered some of the letters from Jodie and Ma but didn’t know much at all about putting them into proper words. After only minutes, he said, “See, you can already write a word.”“Slowly, she unraveled each word of the sentence: “‘ There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.’” “Oh,” she said. “Oh.” “You can read, Kya. There will never be a time again when you can’t read.” “It ain’t just that.” She spoke almost in a whisper. “I wadn’t aware that words could hold so much. I didn’t know a sentence could be so full.” He smiled. “That’s a very good sentence. Not all words hold that much.”“Learning to read was the most fun she’d ever had.”“Jumpin’ said the Social Services are lookin’ for me. I’m scared they’ll pull me in like a trout, put me in a foster home or sump’m.” “Well, we better hide way out there where the crawdads sing. I pity any foster parents who take you on.” Tate’s whole face smiled. “What d’ya mean, where the crawdads sing? Ma used to say that.” Kya remembered Ma always encouraging her to explore the marsh: “Go as far as you can—way out yonder where the crawdads sing.” “Just means far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters. Now, you got any ideas where we can meet?”The story goes on. There is love. There is loss. There is what seems to most folks to be a crime. There are scenes from a compelling courtroom trial.That’s all I’ll tell. You must read “Where the Crawdads Sing” for yourself to fill in the gaps and to temporarily live in a world of the marshland in rich poetry and language. Though the scenes in the courtroom take a marked turn from this rich detail of language and poetry, it makes up for it by putting you inside an interesting and ultimately surprising courtroom drama. Where the Crawdads Sing is one of those books that is so good, one wonders where Delia Owens can go from here?",Gorgeous Sumptuous & Sensual Language,Verified Purchase,

Once I started reading, I could not put it down. I stayed up late reading, and I finished it in 3 days. The story is beautifully told. The descriptions of nature are beautifully written. The author intertwines nature with Kya's story so well, that she does seem more a part of nature than people. This is also a story of how a small town in the 50's and 60's treated an abandoned child. ""A little girl surviving on her own in the swamp, hungry and cold, and they didn't help her. Instead they labeled and rejected her because they thought she was different"" (340).Delia Owens gives us two clues into Kya's psyche that I didn't notice until after I finished the book, and I went back and reread the beginning and end:""The marsh dwellers had their own laws...stamped in their genes. Ancient and natural, like those hatched from hawks and doves. When cornered, desperate, or isolated, man reverts to those instincts that aim straight at survival. Quick and just. It is not morality, but simple math. Among themselves, doves fight as often as hawks"" (8).""Most of what she knew, she'd learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would. If consequences resulted from her behaving differently, then they too were functions of life's fundamental core. Life taught her that ancient genes for survival still persist in some undesirable forms among the twists and turns of man's genetic code"" (363).",Amazing story!,Verified Purchase,

Also, you’ll learn the difference between a swamp and a marsh, and you might even find out how to recognize various birds.Author Delia Owens knows nature, plants and animals. She vividly recreates the world of an isolated child, making her protagonist’s growth from unschooled child to independent adult entirely plausible. But learning the facts of life and relationships from animals and books isn’t going to help Kya resolve the problem of loneliness.

Then, as it jumped back and forth between Kya as a child, and Kya as an adult, I became annoyed.

How could this strange, shy person become worldly wise enough to deal with publishers, handymen, a complete remodel job on her house, etc?

Unlike others, though, I thought the descriptions of the marsh were the best character, so to speak. The people and the story were just too unrealistic for me. It was as though Owens didn't really trust her characters, so Kya didn't just survive abandonment by her entire crappy family, she turned out gorgeous and brilliant. Not only did she learn to read late, she picked it up quickly and was soon reading Einstein-level texts. She wasn't just a keen observer of her world, she became a renowned naturalist. And on and on. When Kya had to go on trial, I actually wondered why she didn't check a few law books out of the library and represent herself. There just seemed to be nothing she couldn't do. Me, I would have thought it remarkable enough that an abandoned child survived to adulthood. I liked it enough; it just didn't rock my world.There are a lot of trite characters: the drunken, cruel father and the dreamy, artistic mother, the kindly black couple who keep a distant watch on her, the two well-born suitors who come from the right side of the tracks.

While I've been to those specific places, I had no knowledge of people who live on the outskirts who are shunned and discriminated against by most of their neighbors in the more heavily-populated towns.  The story revolves around a six year old girl, a marsh-dweller, who is abandoned by her family, actually through no fault of their own.  The fact is one of the harshness and financial poverty of being a marsh dweller.  How attuned to every aspect of the marsh the little girl is gives one pause for wonder.  How she knows how to survive, dependent on the marsh and all its treasures for food, ways of earning pennies to survive, is more than amazing.  She's obviously a bright child who remembers what she learned from her mother and a special brother.  As she grows up struggling, other characters emerge from the fringes of the marsh and small towns whom she learns, gradually, to trust.  There's mystery here which is solved in a startling conclusion.  There's love and heartbreak and false accusations and, eventually, truth.  The descriptive writing about the marsh denizens--the wildlife and fish and animals--is as beautiful as poetry in its lyrical style.

Many people have certain beefs with this book.  The geography is way off, the type of wetland is decidedly fanciful (where are there beaches, cypress, and other types of marsh along with tidal estuaries all together?) and some aspects of the plot stretch credulity.  However, the psychological portrait of motherloss, abusive family dynamics and abandonment are accurate and beautiful, as is the depiction of the love of nature.  People claim that a small child cannot raise herself--her father was there for part of time, and she looked after her self on a minimal, survival level.  Out of necessity, she found a way to survive.  Small town dynamics are different than a lot of people are used to.  People know a lot about others, and yet many things are not spoken of.  Some readers blame Tate for his abandonment of her without taking into a account that he was very young at the time.  It is true that both Tate and Chase are reduced to mere types, but how many books feature female characters that have been put in similar simplistic categories.  The only part of the book I found completely jarring was the second secret life, which just seems improbable.

Tension builds throughout as she learns more about the world away from her narrow experience with human life forms after abandonment by those who should have taken care of her.But...and this is a big one...this book published by G.P. Putnam's Sons contains some errors that should make the editors at the big house cringe and rush to correct. The first one that disappointed me occurred while the police chief and deputy sit after a long day of detective work to figure out who murdered a local man. They are on the deck of their station facing the marsh and then the Atlantic Ocean beyond. The author writes that the two are drinking a beer while watching the sunset. I read the line to my husband and asked him to tell me the location of the novel. ""California,"" he replied. You'd think. But no. A simple, silly mistake that should have been caught and corrected.Then there are multiple references to folks in this small community heading on over to Asheville, North Carolina, as if it's just a short jaunt. Once it's when the father needs to check on his disability payments. In another instance, a mother wants a special gift, but the Ace Hardware near the island didn't carry it so she drives over to Asheville . Sorry, but Asheville may be recognizable to the rest of the country, but anyone who knows the area knows two things. Asheville isn't a big city nor the closest one to the coast. Try Raleigh or Charlotte for checking in the with the VA. Same with the Ace Hardware. I don't think a busy struggling mother would drive more than three hundred miles for a toy when other larger cities are much closer. The critics at the writing conference where I first heard of this complaint speculated that the publishers wanted to use a popular town as reference. But anyone who knows the state at all knows that Asheville is the furthermost city from the coast located in the western part of North Carolina.Fiction elaborates, exaggerates, enhances, and embellishes reality. But if an author uses real places, facts and details should be accurate. I usually put down books that contain such blatant errors. Fortunately, Ms. Owens created such an otherwise compelling read, I forgave and forged ahead to the end. I don't blame her. I blame her editors and proofreaders. I recommend reading the book and ignoring the stupid errors.

However, the author is apparently unable to read a map. In North Carolina, Asheville is the state's most famous town, but it is SEVEN HOURS of interstate driving from the coast. Back in the 50's and 60's, and/or with kids in the car, it would be even longer. Plus, in the 59's and 69's, it was a fairly small town. People at the coast would never have ""run over to Asheville"" for anything, as the characters in this book did at least 3 times before I gave up. Going to Asheville would not have been a 2-day, weekend trip from the coast, either, as happened once. Nevermind the fact that to get to Asheville from the coast, those characters would have had to drive THROUGH at least 2 bigger cities. Ridiculous.

In the end I realized the murder mystery is 100% necessary for the book to be as impactful as it is, and thankfully it doesn't actually read as a murder mystery. The story is about the coming of age of a young woman, and the murder fits within and is such an important part of that coming of age story - both in the troubles it highlights throughout her life up until that point, and in the ways it affects her in the aftermath. The murder is not the main point, it is part of the larger coming of age story.

How does she survive being seven and on her own? How does she just suddenly know how to read without much struggle when a teenager is teaching her over a course of a few months? Some of this is just mind boggling because it doesn’t make sense. You wonder how she takes care of herself and survives. There is no mention of a hurricane, which we know she had to go through one because she is on the coast, and there are and have been hurricanes. I was just unimpressed.

The author also does a great job of helping you visualize the surroundings of where the story takes place, and in an interesting way, weaves her knowledge of nature and the natural environment into the story.

She wanders, collecting feathers, shells and plants. She meets a boy a few years older than herself who teaches her to read and write. Tate is kind and patient, and a gentle, youthful romance blossoms between them. Kya no longer feels so alone.But in the town, the adults scorn her and call her dirty “Marsh Girl”. The group of popular kids think it’s fun sport to frighten Kya. When one of them takes things too far, there are horrific consequences.Comments: I finally gave up on waiting for Where the Crawdads Sing at the library and purchased a copy.

Her mother abandoned her and her 4 other siblings. Kya's Pa is an abusive alcoholic and so Kya's siblings all leave shortly after. Kya is left for several years with her Pa who is only at their marshland shack intermittently as he goes out on drinking benders for days. In time he leaves for one of his benders and does not return. Kya is forced to figure out how to live and provide for herself.This book starts off by punching you in the heart and this is a trend throughout most of the book. It is solemn and melancholy, but the discriptions of the marsh land emphasized her shelter and safety were not with people, but the land she lived off of. She was independent and wildly herself. She is strong and resilient and kind and gentle.There are two timelines we see in this book. This book starts off in 1969 with the investigation of a murder and leading up to a possible resolution of who the murderer was. Then we have the other time line that takes place in 1952 as we watch Kya grow and leading up to everything that happened before the murder prior to 1969. We see Kya's harsh life and the men she fell in love with. We see her passion for the marsh.There were so many beautiful discriptions of the marshland that really made you feel immersed in this land. They discribed the stars and the wildlife, the grass and the bugs. I really enjoy it. And if you expect to enjoy this book, be prepared for quite a bit of that.I love Kya and her analytic mind. We often saw the marsh through her inquisitive eyes. She had a background deeply rooted in science and so scientific themes, evolution and biology would periodically surface to recapture the marsh from her point of view.This book wasn't an ""at edge of my seat"" kind of book. More along the lines it crept up on me. It took me 230 pages to really click with it.

In trying to be realistic about small towns, it stereotyped to excess. I grew up in the South, but was born in the North. Yes I was made fun of by kids and teachers who ridiculed my Yankee accent. Yes it took time to be accepted and finally able to feel I belonged. But I'm not convinced an entire small town would be so calloused, mean and utterly stupid.  It wasn't easy to believe all the things this girl went through as any reflection of reality. It certainly conveyed how people in small towns anywhere! can be closed off to different things and people that they avoid them making them even more isolated and lonely. But this book seemed to make a quaisi political point that southerners would turn their backs on a child in dire and dangerous straits. I didn't buy the premise, but I can't say I hated the book.  The nature aspects were engaging. The skipping from story to investigation was and always is annoying and disruptive. I hate when authors do that instead of integrating the different stories for the reader who's paid money for the book.

However, as a North Carolinian, this book drove me nuts. There are so many words  phrases, and descriptions that do not fit life or the geography of Eastern NC. We don’t have a “sea”; maybe the author was trying to describe one of the many large sounds we have or the Intracoastal Waterway which lies between the barrier islands and the mainland. We have the largest strand of barrier islands, so Kya didn’t have a swamp, the “sea”, estuaries and the ocean at the same location; we have dolphins, not porpoises; palmettos are farther south. So many small, yet obvious references were so off that it just made the setting silly and glaringly fake. Also, the author plugged Asheville twice as a place to buy goods...what?? Why would the residents of a coastal town bypass New Bern (unless the fake town was New Bern), Greenville, Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, etc? Another silly, thorny scratch in the novel’s setting. New Bern was NC’s original Capital City- the Capital building burned to the ground in 1792 and Raleigh was then selected as the new Capital City. Why not just use real names of real places?I did enjoy the author’s fabulous use of alliteration, and her ability to unfold the mystery so that I wanted to reread portions of the book again to see what clues I might have missed.

In lyrical language, the child Kya's relationship with the natural world conveys a sense of wonder and appreciation of life. This is the best part of the book, showing how we are renewed and supported by our natural environment. However, this story is set against a gloomy plot. Some of the main characters are vibrant, but others are hollow and vague.Two books are being written. One is the story of a child growing up despite a minimum of parenting but with the comfort and lessons of the natural world, who suffers abuse but finds help from other outcasts and compassionate people. Dawn and gifts. The other story is a crass justification for people behaving badly. Love and death are reduced to a non-human level of understanding. People who have good character are sent into the background. Even the beautiful is dreadful. Twilight and fireflies.The book tries to have it both ways: that the child Kya matured and excelled intellectually because of a few relationships with other people and with nature, but also never really developed emotionally, morally and ethically for the same reasons. This doesn't make sense. Kya is shown examples of morality and ethics in her relationships with those few who did help her. There are lessons in compassion and non-violent resilience in the marsh life as well as the cruel ones. She has the ability to read and write. She does reflect, which is essential to making moral and ethical decisions. She relies on certain people, knows they care for her and will accept her gifts.Do the repeated hardships keep her from maturing as a human being, or does choose which examples and lessons to follow? Either way, she has a thin excuse for the actions she takes with the man who loves her and the man who threatens her. What we're left with is someone who only understands human behavior well enough to mimic it, and only understands the natural world well enough to mimic it. But that is not the dreaming, loving, artistic and forgiving person who appears in some parts of the book. So which is it?After showing growth from experience and reflection, the story reverts to an old paradigm, perhaps the fatal flaw or a last century psychology, rather than moving forward into greater understanding, that is, humanity.

Since Amazon does not accommodate fractional star ratings, my Amazon rating rounds to 4 stars.First, congratulations to real-world scientist Delia Owens for writing a mega-bestseller as her debut novel. With over 28,000 Amazon reviews, there seems little point in me adding this one additional review, as my rating won’t perceptibly affect the average and there is little chance that anyone will read my review. Nevertheless, I will proceed.The author paints her scenes with detailed observations couched in beautiful, poetic metaphors. This is the hallmark of talented, commercially successful writers. Here is an example from the Prologue: “Swamp water is still and dark, having swallowed the light in its muddy throat.” Very nice.Like all successful novels, the opening draws you in and makes you want to discover what happens next. And I found the chapter-to-chapter time alternation, between post-crime (post-accident?) and pre-crime (years earlier) engaging and effective. But late in the book, when the two narratives converge to one, I began to tire of this world. It seemed at that point that the author was just piling on words and plot elements in a formulaic, contrived way to wrap things up and drag the story across the finish line.The part near the end where Tate, searching their shack after Kya dies, finds Chase’s necklace hidden away in a secret little cubbyhole seems particularly stupid. Why would she save the necklace of a man she hated to the point of murdering him? This would be an especially dumb thing to do because it ties her to the crime. The only apparent explanation is that the author needed a simple, clear, symbolic gimmick to signify in one fell swoop that Kya really was the guilty party after all.The final chapters would have felt more real, and more interesting, if Tate had left Kya again, or if Kya eventually relented and went to live in the city to support Tate’s career, then spends the rest of her life pining for her life in the marsh that she left behind, but then, also finds compensating joys in city life, such as having a few kids with Tate and watching them grow. Hey, life is complicated.And I was disappointed that Ms. Owens, who is a scientist herself, would not try to avail herself of some basics of FORENSIC science vis-à-vis her crime investigation scenes. From the descriptions in the book, the old, abandoned fire tower is composed of weathered, rotted wood and rusty iron grates. In the real world, fingerprints are not recoverable from such surfaces and law enforcement personnel would not be dumb enough to even try. And if they were dumb enough to try, no prints would be recovered (not even from the two boys) and the lab would set the officers straight as to why this negative result was meaningless.And by the way, with all the emphasis on the lack of fingerprints, the author never attempted to explain why Kya left none at the crime scene. If you’re going to build a fantasy world where recoverable fingerprints can be left on weathered, rotted wood and rusty iron grates, and if you’re going to make a big deal out of “no fingerprints left at the scene,” then you should pay at least some lip service to answering the question of why Kya left no prints. At least Tate could speculate, upon realizing that Kya really did commit the murder, that “I guess she was careful enough to wear gloves that night.” Maybe Tate could even find a pair of gloves in the secret cubbyhole. After all, if Kya was dumb enough to keep Chase’s necklace, then she might also be dumb enough to keep the pair of gloves she wore at the murder scene.Another apparent verisimilitude failure—where author/scientist Owens seems not to appreciate the laws of physics—is on page 254, where a sheriff’s boat whips in front of Kya’s boat, she rams her boat into the sheriff’s boat, and she is then “[t]hrown back against the outboard, her neck jerked.” In this situation, Kya’s body would be thrown FORWARD, not back.Finally, my understanding is that the fiction-reading public is predominantly female, and female fiction authors enjoy considerable, deserved success catering to this public. But as a male reading female fiction for female readers, I invariably have to suffer through lots of verbiage dedicated to food and clothing. This novel is no exception: lots of verbiage about food and clothing. At least in this case, some of that verbiage is justified because it is a matter of genuine concern for the reader as to how a ten-year-old child, alone and fending for herself at the edge of civilization, manages to feed and clothe herself. Even so, there was more verbiage about food and clothing than I wanted to read, and I’m puzzled as to why women find these topics so endlessly fascinating.","Good start, some good writing, some misses, peters out a little toward the end",Verified Purchase,

I loved this book, but I had a few issues with it that held back one star.Poor Kya had an extremely hard childhood...abandoned by her family, made fun of at school the one time she went, she is a true daughter of the marsh. Hence the name, ""Marsh Girl"". Everyone makes fun of her, fears her, thinks she is ""different"" than them, which scares them.With the help of a few compassionate people, and her eagerness to learn and live, Kya makes a life for herself. However, one of the town favorites, Chase Andrews, is found dead, and Kya is the immediate favorite suspect. She is different from the other town folk--she has never fit in or tried to fit in, which gives her a ""mark"" none of the other townspeople have. So, with no real evidence, the town (minus a few people) is determined to blame Kya for the untimely death of Chase. What happens will definitely shock you!I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading a book about a strong female heroine who has gone against all odds to become successful, and define success for herself. She lives the life she wants to live, instead of conforming to the norms of society, and that is a truly beautiful thing.

The author explained Kya to the reader ad nauseam; great writing allows the reader to discover a character. The characters and the plot weren’t awful - had the writing been tighter and more compelling. I enjoyed the premise (though many details didn’t ring true), and the characters could have been engaging. For a first novel, the editors didn’t serve the author well. I really don’t understand why this book has received the acclaim that it has. Seriously dsappointing.Two years later: I still hate this book to the point that it makes me angry. There are many things that just make no sense. Do North Carolinians actually call their towns ‘villages’???? Are fire towers really built *in marshes* *at the edge of an ocean*???  !!!  These are serious insults to the reader. Amazon reviewers who grew up in NC find the details of the area laughable. It’s as though the editors didn’t have a clue that this book would be a big success, so they simply didn’t bother to do their jobs. I hated this book, because it’s trite, and filled with complete implausibilities and inaccuracies. The biggest mystery about this book is its success — is a U.S. education actually so godawful that this sort of poorly-written drivel is rated as great literature? I don’t get it.",Disappointing.

For one, the story seemed like something I could never get excited about, being set in the U.S of fifties and sixties, and for another, everyone kept harping on about how emotional it is. Fortunately, Where The Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens lived up to all the hype surrounding it.I cannot call this story of Kya Clark, popularly known as the Marsh Girl, a roller coaster of emotions because there were only high emotions all through the book. Catherine ""Kya"" Clark is barely 7 when she sees her mother walk away from home, never to return. The youngest of 5 siblings, she is left alone when all her much older siblings also leave their abusive father. What follows is a tale of heartache, hardship, the resilience of human spirit in face of adversity, and the need for love and belonging in a person's life.Kya's family lives in a marsh, on the outskirts of Barkley Cove, a very small town on the coast. They are known as the town trash, just one step up from the ""coloreds"" in North Carolina of the 1950s. When her family disappears, hardly anyone in the town is bothered. It is with the help of a black couple and an old friend of her brother, that Kya manages to survive on her own, all alone, surrounded by hundred of acres of marsh land.While we learn of Kya's past, there is an alternate story about the suspected murder of Barkley Cove's golden boy, Chase Andrews. His influential parents, and many others in the town, believe that the Marsh Girl is responsible for the murder. Now Kya has to face a murder trial in a town already prejudiced against her, with the possibility of being given the death penalty.As I read the book, I was struck by the fact that real and true love doesn't mean making things easy for the other person. Real love is when you work towards making that person independent and able to stand on their own feet. Reading about a little girl left all alone to fend for herself was not easy. To imagine her going through life without anyone to cuddle her or take care of her, just broke my heart. At the same time, her will to survive, and her determination to win despite all the odds against her, made me cheer her on.The book is also full of lessons on the wildlife found on the North Carolina coastal areas. All types of birds and insects make an appearance and it was hard not to stop reading and look up the creature being talked about. There are zoology lessons along with some stirring poetry that makes this book a unique experience for the reader. Many reviews talk about the murder mystery in the book. However, I was so invested in Kya and what was happening to her that I couldn't care less about the mystery of who killed Chase, or whether it was a murder or an accident after all.A sweet, poignant book about a girl's journey through life, this book is recommended for those who like drama, emotions, romance and love, as well as those who like reading about wild life.",4.25 Stars,Verified Purchase,

Kya Clark is the ""Marsh Girl"", abandoned first by her mother, then her siblings and finally, when she was 10, by her abusive, drunken father who went to town and never returned, leaving her alone in an old shack in the marsh. Somehow Kya survived, collecting mussels to sell at the marina gas station to the old guy who ran the station, Jumpin', in exchange for gas and food. Jumpin' and his wife Mabel were the only ones who showed any care or concern for Kya, giving her old clothes as she grows as well as extra food. Scorned and ridiculed on the only day she went to school, Kya avoided the town but made friends with Tate, a boy who liked to fish in the marsh and shared her passion for the wildlife around them. Tate eventually teaches Kya to read and write but it is the marsh that becomes her classroom as she studies and learns all about the plant and animal species that live there.The murder mystery is almost in the background here as the marsh dominates the narrative and atmosphere of this story. The writing is so evocative that the peace and beauty of the marsh and it's lagoons and waterways shine through.

The last time I looked, gift was a noun. The word give as a verb has served us well for a long, long time, and like so many other words that some writers and speakers of the English language have used incorrectly, “gifting” has insidiously crept into vocabularies and replaced “giving.” Just one more thing along with apostrophes incorrectly used in plurals that spoils my love of reading. “Gifting” may have a place on Facebook and may not bother those who have no love of language, but I took away a star for it.

The narrative is fine, in fact in many descriptions of nature, it is excellent as one might expect of an accomplished naturalist as Ms. Owens is. The dialogue however relies almost entirely on dialect. A little of this goes a long way, and Owens could have trusted the reader’s comprehension of regional accent rather than creating an Lil Abner type of verbal exchange. This was so annoying that I almost stopped reading, something I almost never do. I’m glad I gave the book a chance, however, as the story is fairly interesting in an anachronistic Girl of the Limberlost way. The enormous praise of many readers and the book’s position on popular lists mystifies me, to be honest. I don’t find it more than a mediocre read.

It’s still winter here in the Midwest. Even though we are starting to get hints of spring, it’s not in full bloom. Being able to escape into the forest and the marsh through this book was so awesome. Delia Owens’s descriptions really bring the scene to life. I’ve read a few opinions on the book saying that it was too descriptive, but it was perfect for me.All of the characters had really interesting developments. I felt like every character had their stories wrapped up in a fitting fashion. One of them, we never really find out what happens – but, again, it’s fitting. Kya is the main character, and I don’t think you could even ask for more character development. It seems like we got just enough of her life story for it to be complete and wrapped up. That is SO satisfying to me because you don’t always get that.I just absolutely loved this book. A mixture of a coming of age story as well as a murder mystery and a love note to nature. It’s just beautifully written. The story is told so well. I didn’t want it to end. I would recommend it to anyone who loves nature.This book has one of the greatest last chapters I’ve ever read in a novel. It ties things up without blatantly just laying out answers to your questions. It’s so beautifully written and wraps up years of Kya’s life swiftly but respectfully.5/5 StarsMemorable Quotes: “Sometimes she heard night-sounds she didn’t know or jumped from lightning too close, but whenever she stumbled, it was the land that caught her. Until at last, at some unclaimed moment, the heart-pain seeped away like water into sand. Still there, but deep. Kya laid her head upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.”“Crows can’t keep secrets any better than mud; once they see something curious in the forest they have to tell everybody.”“Autumn was coming; the evergreens might not have noticed, but the sycamores did.

Kya emerges as one of the most fascinating characters written in years. Her unique circumstances and outstanding ability to embrace and study the marsh land that so fully defines her has created a humanity that defies the reader to take a slow look around their own community and see people in a different light. Her story shed light on the plight of so many children who were let down by every single adult in their lives and found a way to endure. These stories are too frequently lived in the very cities of our large urban areas still today. As much as I loved the character of Kya, the more ashamed I was at any time I turned when I saw a street child who was completely abandoned and hungry. Thank you to the author for reminding me the importance of SEEING these children.Another great concept from this novel was the difference between ""school"" smart and intelligent. Kya's intelligence, and later in life her validation of that intelligence, was an inspiration. The sweet and sometimes sour love story woven through that search of learning was both heartwarming and heart breaking. Just very well written.This is one of those books that will be with me forever.

A novel in which a stretch of marshland on the North Carolina coast figures as a major player in the narrative. The marsh and Kya (nicknamed “The Marsh Girl” by the locals) are equally the protagonists of this novel. Kya grows up in the marsh and while still a child is abandoned by her family. This leaves her with the marsh as her one abiding companion. “For Kya, it was enough to be part of this natural sequence as sure as the tides.” The marsh is not swampland. It is where plants and water depend on one another, creating a unique ecosystem that attracts its own species of birds and insects. As she matures Kya learns to paint and describe all the life forms of the marsh, eventually publishing books that reveal for the first time the secrets uncovered by her intimate and continuous observations of them.Delia Owens has woven into this already fascinating story a charge of murder against Kya and the trial that ensues. Yet it ends as it starts by telling the story of Kya as someone who sees human life as governed by the same laws that prevail in the natural world. In the court Kya compares the judge to the alpha male (with the biggest antlers), her defense attorney to a powerful buck, and the prosecuting attorney to a lesser male who needs to shout to be noticed, just as lesser male animals make up for their inferior presence with gimmicks. Kya can discern the same dominance hierarchies that create stability in the bird and animal kingdoms in the world of humans.I don’t mean to suggest that this is a novel in which little happens in this primitive natural world. Delia Owens opens the book in 1952 when Kya is only six. Within a few pages the narrative jumps to 1969 when the murdered man’s body is discovered. From then on the book alternates between Kya’s life moving relentlessly to her arrest for the murder in 1970 and the course of the investigation from 1969 to 1970, both strands coming together in 1970 when Kya is arrested and put on trial. The plot is gripping and skillfully handled.Just as Kya moves from the freedom of the marsh to the deathly confines of her cement block cell, so the fecund marsh gives way to the swamp inland where “life decays and reeks and returns to the rotted duff . . . death begetting life.” The parallels are subtly presented and work satisfyingly together. This is without doubt the best and most satisfying novel I’ve read this year. I would recommend it without reservation.",An unforgettable and unusual novel,Verified Purchase,

It was both heartbreaking and rewarding to follow Kya as she moves through her life surrounded by so many of the good and bad people that life has to offer.  The love story is very understated and artfully woven into a much bigger plot.  My only reason for four-stars is that I just didn't like the ending.  I am sure plenty of people would fight me on this, and I guess looking back, a small part of me had to have known this was where the story would lead.  I think if I reread the book, I would be even more sure of that based on Kya's connection with the laws of nature.

As Kya, Tate, and Chase move throughout the marsh, the reader can see the cypress knees, the various plants and grasses and hear the sounds of the birds, the frogs, and the other animals that inhabit the sprawling wilderness.  She does a fantastic job in creating Kya and helping her grow from a little girl surrounded by family to a little girl surviving on her own in the marsh as she waits for her Mother to return.
