Everyone has eaten it before, and we all know what to expect. My MAJOR issue is the amount of cans that are dented in the cases. Nearly 40% of mine had to be discarded. After having worked in a warehouse as a youngster, working with lifts and loaders, I can only surmise that these cans are being destroyed on purpose. Maybe some disgruntled packer and his buds think this is funny and retributional. But, after buying many cases of various dented, more like destroyed, canned items, I have decided to no longer purchase such items. The lost/waste of my order is just too much to continue to do so. UPDATE: After further inspection I have discovered that the dented cans are found in the middle of the case of cans. This would indicate that Campbell's, in fact, packed them this way, and sold them to Amazon. This is an old trick I learned while working for a soft drink company. The question remains, did Amazon get a discount for buying these defective cans , or was Amazon duped by the Campbell's company? I no longer want to implicate the stockers at Amazon, they may be hard working people with no knowledge of what is in the case. This may in fact, be an agreement with Amazon executives and Campbell..",The waste of it all!!!,Flavor Name: Homestyle Chicken NoodleSize: 10.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)Verified Purchase,152 people found this helpful

Yes, there were some dented cans, but the can still burped ""safety"" when opened. The soup stock is basic Campbell's flavor which in my opinion is good. Think Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup. There are sparse amounts of small chicken squares added, then maybe half a dozen won tons stuffed with chicken.Is this restaurant quality soup? Of course not. It's a can of Campbell's soup! I've been eating Campbell's soup since I was a kid and I suspect most of the readers here are also familiar with Campbells. Campbells puts out a decent product. It has it's trademark flavor that we're used to. The Won Ton soup is a variation of that. By the way, the noddles are a bit thick compared to a restaurant won ton. But still has a good flavor. If you're wanting some won ton soup quickly, if you have a few cans on the shelf this will do the trick. Bear in mind, you're getting a good product and there may be some dented cans. SO WHAT????

The wontons are simply two pieces of noodle attached together with nothing inside, certainly far from any wonton soup I have ever had.  The soup stock is similar to chicken noodle soup and there are some green leafy vegetables.  As I tried these can they grew on me.  Two cans of soup and one can of water worked best for me with black pepper added.  The issue is that soup is very inexpensive at Chinese takeout places and these cans are not really any less expensive but you can’t beat the convenience.

It is perfect for putting on warm in a slowcooker for 25 hours- I did this for The Sabbath because I am Jewish and I wanted to avoid cooking on The Sabbath. It actually I think tastes better the longer it sits, because the flavors have a chance to enhance and blend together. The solids (like the chicken) and the noodles are there, but not over the top. The spices and salt are perfect. Just add a can of water, and you're good to go.I am Jewish but am also very poor so I can not afford kosher meat. As the saying goes in Judaism, the body is a temple and we must treat it with respect. I don't believe not eating meat would be treating my body with respect. If you are Jewish and can afford kosher meat and have access to it, you should get it instead of this option or any non kosher meat option.

But, by searching on the internet recently, I came across the soup for sale on Amazon.  Others, as well as myself, have wondered if the product was fresh stock since it's very hard to find.  Well, I recently called Campbell's to inquire if the soup was still in production, and they assured me it was.  So, last fall, I ordered 2 cases of the soup on Amazon   Campbell's Beefy Mushroom, 10.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)           and the expiration was in 2011 or 2012 (I forget).  I've already used up all the soup and I'm ready to order more.  When this soup first appeared in grocery stores years ago, the label had this YUMMY recipe on it, which I have used ever since.  It is my husband's favorite hamburger dish.  This recipe transforms ordinary hamburger into a delicious comfort food your family is sure to love.  It's so easy to make, but ohhh sooo good!  Here it is:""Campbell's Salisbury Steak""1 (10 3/4 ounce) can Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup1 1/2 lbs ground beef1 egg, lightly beaten1/2 c. fine dry breadcrumbs1/4 c. finely chopped onion1/8 t. pepper1/4 c. water1) Add 1/4 c. soup, egg, breadcrumbs, onion and pepper to the ground beef and mix well.2) Shape into 6 patties.3) Brown both sides in ungreased skillet, over medium heat; not cooking them completely.4) Drain off the fat.5) Spoon over the patties the undiluted Beefy-Mushroom soup and 1/4 c. water.6) Cover the skillet and simmer over low heat 20 minutes or until done, spooning the gravy over the patties occasionally.7) Delicious served with mashed potatoes, cooked green beans and rolls with butter.Serves 6",Campbell's Beefy Mushroom Soup Is Still Made,Flavor Name: Beefy MushroomSize: 10.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)Verified Purchase,25 people found this helpful
