We have drank the refrigerated Horizon Milk purchased at the grocery store for several years.  However, with the pandemic, the grocery store was often out of that milk, especially the milk with the DHA, so I found this on Amazon and thought it would be a good substitute for my daughter.  WRONG!  WRONG!  WRONG!  When I got the first case, I tasted it, and it tasted like chocolate milk, but when I opened the second case, my daughter was reluctant to drink it.  Today I decided I would try one, and it was the WORST thing I have ever tasted.  Even though this product is shelf stable, it absolutely had to be spoiled!  I started reading reviews on here and found that a lot of people have received expired product.  Mine was not expired.  It was about a month away from expiration but absolutely was bad, very bad!  Because we drink Horizon regularly, I knew Horizon has a money back guarantee so I contacted them only to find out that Horizon DOES NOT partner with/sell to Amazon so their money back guarantee does not apply.  I repeat that again...HORIZON DOES NOT SELL TO AMAZON!  However, the customer service rep was nice enough to issue me a one-time refund under the circumstances which I think shows Horizon is a good company.  She told me the bar code number on the box is their product, but they do not sell to Amazon.  So, who knows where this milk has been and at what temperatures.  It can be kept in the pantry/at room temperature.  It does not have to be refrigerated, but I can only assume this sat at extreme temperatures for an extended period and spoiled.  I just don't know why it would have tasted as AWFUL otherwise.  I buy a lot from Amazon but WILL NOT purchase items like this from them in the future.  I will not take any chances with my family's health.",DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON!!,Flavor Name: Chocolate with DHASize: 8 Fl Oz (Pack of 12)Verified Purchase,70 people found this helpful

My 1yo son wants milk the second he wakes up and we have a 2 story house. Somehow he doesn't like straight-out-of-the-fridge-cold milk first thing in the AM. It was getting rediculous for this Mama to be getting up at the crack ass of dawn running downstairs, getting the milk out of the fridge, finding a sippy-cup, pouring the milk into the cup, putting the milk in the microwave 20 seconds to heat slightly, then running back upstairs! Not to mention the amount of fresh milk we were going through and dealing with trying to avoid going to grocery store every 3 days. We're in a Pandemic and trying to avoid going to stores as often! Have you tried freezing gallons of milk in attempt to avoid having to go to the store just for more milk? I have and it is not fun. You have to pour some out (since the milk expands once frozen and you don't want a gallon of milk to explode in the freezer), then find room in the freezer for a huge gallon of milk! And then the whole thawing process! Who has 2 days time to wait for it to thaw?! And the milk consistency is weird after thawing too!!! So seriously thank you to whomever developed shelf stable milk! I now take a little carten and sippy-cup upstairs with me every night, set it on my nightstand, and when he wake up in the AM I take the included straw to poke a hole, pour the perfectly room temp milk into his sippy-cup and that's it!!!! He loves it and drinks every drop. I ran out a few weeks ago and was again reminded of why these little cartens are a straight up necessity for us now! :D Definitely recommend to anyone who has a little on-the-go milk guzzler and using fresh perishable milk isn't ideal, or Mamas who are having to go on a hike-and-a-half just to fetch some milk whether it be allllllll the way downstairs or allllllll the way at the possibly virus-laden grocery store. Save youself some sanity and buy this. I still also buy the Horizon Growing Years Whole Milk for his afternoon and evening milk which he likes straight-from-the-fridge-cold but buy these cartens as a supplement for the AM and when on the go.
