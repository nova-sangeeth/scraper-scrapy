In fact, it’s the first book in years that I actually pre-ordered. The premise is interesting enough: there is an ethereal library that exists between life and death. You are permitted to choose any book from the shelves and each book contains an alternative life. Each life is what would have resulted if you changed a single decision you regretted. Interesting, right? Like you could see what would have happened if you’d gone for that coffee date or pursued that master’s degree or kept playing piano. In the midst of each new life, if the life-hopper finds herself disappointed, she winds up back at the library to try again. Eventually, you’ll either find a life that is the best possible outcome or your “root life” blinks you away into death.Unfortunately, the premise is played out in the most expected way possible. Nora Seed reverses her regrets and realizes that even the best alternate universes have uncertainties and pain and sadness and disappointment. Even when she winds up with her dream job and a great family, she can’t stay to play this life out. Why? Well, because it isn’t really “hers.” So, surprise, surprise, she ends up waking up from her suicide attempt with a new appreciation for the life she once had and longed to depart.If you read the first 30-40 pages of this book, you’ll probably be able to write the rest of it in your mind. It’s supposedly an opportunity to explore infinite universes, so why choose the most predictable course of actions? To get across the point that you ought to realize the beauty of the life we have around us? Just write a greeting card to convey the message; an entire book is unnecessary. Additionally, it seems like the author either doesn’t understand or chose not to really explore the idea of infinite options. In all her lives, the most remarkably unique one is granted one sentence of exploration, “In one life she only ate toast” (212). Every other life is just variations on themes of work, friends, romantic partners, and family. Of the infinite possibilities available to explore, nothing unexpected happens. It’s maddening as the author keeps smashing his readers over the head with ideas that anything might happen while never delivering on the promise.The writing style is difficult to evaluate. It just feels there. Sentence after sentence slowly moving the predictable story forward. It’s utilitarian prose lacking poetry and depth--seemingly at odds with a book that is attempting to spelunk the internal caverns of a deeply depressed person. The author constantly quotes philosophers but doesn’t seem to have any real interest in engaging seriously with philosophical ideas. It’s a novel in form but a cheesy self-help book in content. This novel is a seed of an interesting idea which was never cared for and died below ground.

It had me at ‘library that contains an infinite number of books’. Then there’s my mild obsession with all things multiverse and my knowing that there isn’t a version of me that doesn’t end up reading this book. I was so hyped up about this book that I preordered three different versions of it. (Sorry, bank account …)What I didn’t expect was to come to the realisation that I didn’t actually like Nora. It took almost no time at all for me to begin resenting her for squandering her potential. She was intelligent and gifted in various disciplines but she bailed on multiple opportunities that most people could only dream of having. Even though I also acknowledged and empathised with the pain she’d experienced, it still took a long time for me to stop being distracted by the privilege she took for granted.‘Never underestimate the big importance of small things.’I loved the idea of being able to test drive different versions of the life that could have been, although it did raise some questions for me. Some were addressed in this book but others are still ticking over in my mind.Nora inhabits the bodies of a number of different versions of herself, all living lives that could potentially have been hers. When she returns to the library the other Noras resume their lives. Nora’s actions in a borrowed life could easily result in consequences that would derail an aspect of the life of the Nora that lives there, and I wondered if I would chance that if I was in her place. I’d hate to think that me acting in an unintentionally careless way could have real world consequences for another version of me.If someone who has their own version of the Midnight Library chooses to stay in one of the lives they visit, what happens to the version of themselves who lived there first? Do they die? Swap existences with the interloper? Or is their existence undone entirely? Also, if you remain in another version of your life, could you ever truly feel like you belong or would you constantly feel like you need to fake knowing people that weren’t a part of your original life?I did eventually get over my initial resentment/envy of Nora’s many opportunities and settled into exploring each new possible life with her. There were some lives I wanted to visit longer and others I wanted to escape from almost immediately. It seemed obvious from early on where Nora’s story was leading.One thing that I hadn’t given much thought to in the context of this story prior to reading it was the impact that Nora’s choices in life, big and small, would have on the other people in her life. In this respect it reminded me of ‘The Butterfly Effect’, although Nora’s story is nowhere near as dark as Evan’s. Paulo Coelho’s ‘Veronika Decides to Die’ and Robert Frost’s ‘The Road Not Taken’ also popped into my mind as I was reading.I wound up thinking a lot about who my Mrs Elm would be and the form that my Midnight Library would take. While my Library would have books (obviously!), I’m still not entirely sure who my Mrs Elm is.I don’t know if it’s possible to read this book without thinking about your own regrets. Equally, I don’t know if it’s possible to read this book without considering the changes you could make in your life to erase them.The story is told quite simply. It seemed to me to be part cautionary tale, part self help book and part Philosophy 101.‘Now go on, live, while you still have the chance.’Content warnings are included on my blog.",‘Never underestimate the big importance of small things.’,,213 people found this helpful

Every time I needed a new book to read I came first to this one, constantly forgetting that it wasn't coming out till the end of the month. As soon as it came out, I bought it.Whelp, it was a bit of a disappointment. I did enjoy it, and I loved the idea of it, but it was kind of a letdown in some aspects. I won't synopsize this book as it's already been done here numerous times, but here are some of my thoughts on this story...~ I didn't really like Nora. I have a very...we'll say...'full' personality and I have trouble dealing with/relating to people who are 'poor me' all the time. The only person who can make positive changes in our own lives is US. WE are the masters of our own destinies, so Nora's depression over the life she was leading based on all the choices SHE made was difficult for me to handle. She had some amazing opportunities that people would kill for, and she blew Every. Single. One. Of. Them.Now, I understand anxiety. I have family members who suffer from awful anxiety and without the proper medication, I myself would be on the nightly news every time I have to get on an aeroplane (I hate them they're the devils' transport), but I deal with it. You see a doctor, you find what works for you and you try your best to go about your life. (I understand not everyone can do that, but that's how *I* deal with it). I just couldn't relate at all to Nora's depression and her inability to try and do better for herself when she clearly had so much to offer.~ I REALLY didn't like the fact that every time Nora entered a new life, she was a complete stranger to it. Why? What was the point of making it that way? It was incredibly jarring and uncomfortable to sit through Nora trying to figure out where she was, who everyone was, and what she did for a living and knowing NOTHING about her life. Why make her go through all that each time?How could she get possibly get comfortable in any particular life when within the first 15 minutes she could SERIOUSLY screw it all up by saying or doing the wrong thing? I didn't like it and it kind of gave me anxiety every time I had to read about her floundering and flustering her way through a new life (I know, I know...hush).~ The ending could be seen from space. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but just know that there are no surprises here. What you think is going to happen is exactly what's going t happen. While I knew it was coming, I was still happy with the end result.~ I LOVED the Midnight Library. I thought that entire segment of the book was brilliant and I loved the time we spent in there.Overall, I did enjoy this book, but I didn't love it. I think my expectations were a bit too high and it didn't help that I didn't get on that well with Nora. That said though, I would still recommend it. If you're interested in Matt Haig, I REALLY recommend 'How to Stop Time'! I absolutely loved that book. It's still one of my favorites.",3.5 Stars...Slightly Disappointing...,Verified Purchase,93 people found this helpful

Perhaps it was the author's heavy heavy use of foreshadowing. Perhaps it was the subject and plot. Either way, there's nothing at all exciting, challenging, or novel about the story.

I was really looking forward to reading it after seeing such great reviews for this book both on Amazon and on Goodreads. (Still can't understand why it got such high ratings!!)  After reading the first few pages I immediately began to get a sinking feeling that this book was not going to be what I was expecting and the more I read it,  I see my prediction is going to be right.  There really isn't much substance to this novel to warrant all the positive reviews it has gotten.  While the premiss of the story is a great concept and idea, the way the author delivers the storyline doesn't give it much substance or poignant messages for the reader to dwell on. I was hoping to get something out of it but it basically is just a very flat story with no creativity involved.  For instance, the character of Nora gets the opportunity to experience different lives that she regrets to have never followed through on in her root life. But what is so strange is that while she physically looks and feels different, mentally she is totally not there!!  She has no idea who the people are in these lives nor does she have any concept of what her role is.  For me, I'm finding it so annoying having to read how lost and confused Nora is every time she enters these new lives. Reading about how she has to ad lib her way through them all without any clue about her surroundings or any idea of how she got to be who she is is getting to be so tedious.  It just makes me wonder how is that suppose to give her the opportunity to really feel every nuance of these regretted lives and know if it is better or worse??  In other words, she can't be the person she is in these different lives without some changes to her personality or mental well being if she has changed physically.  Who's to say the character of Nora would be OK with the compromises and choices she made in some of these lives??  Especially in the lives where she manages to become so successful!!  I guess my biggest regret is that I had hopes that this book would have been similar to Mitch Albom's book The Five People You Meet in Heaven.  But it most definitely is NOT.  It think it would have been better if Nora would have gotten to watch herself in those lives rather than live in them muddling her way through just being lost and confused.  So while I pretty much can predict the outcome of this book and already know where it is heading, I will just continue to ""muddle"" my way through it to read the disappointing ending before I chuck it to good will.",big disappointment and let down!,Verified Purchase,26 people found this helpful

Nora is on a guided quest to learn a sequence of lessons that offer no real interest or surprises.

Her brother isn't speaking to her because she quit their rock band. And her beloved cat has died. So Nora decides to die by suicide. When she is in that state between life and death (presumably in a coma), she arrives at the Midnight Library where Mrs. Elm, Nora's school librarian from way back when, is the mistress of this mysterious place. Mrs. Elm informs Nora that she may choose from all these millions of books on the shelves of the Midnight Library to see how her life would have turned out had she made different choices. That is, what if she had gotten married? What if she had pursued swimming and competed in the Olympics? What if she had realized her career dream of becoming a glaciologist? Or that even crazier dream of becoming a rock star? The bulk of the book is Nora coming back to Earth in the guise of these different lives that would have been.I forced myself to finish it just in case it improved. It didn't. It was mildly amusing at best, boring and banal at worst.

I was drawn to the concept of a library of ME, of endless shelves of lives I could have lived had my decisions been made more mindfully. The trouble is, it's not that simple...As Nora, guided by her personal librarian, proceeds through the proffered lives she experiences, she keeps making the same mistakes of judgment and choice that brought her to teetering on the knife-edge of death by suicide. Every time she returns for a new book of life in the library, after every sound suggestion from Mrs. Elm, Nora proceeds to another life as a path not taken and still finds herself unsatisfied.II appreciated how skillfully Matt Haig wove together Nora's lives, dreams, aspirations,  and perceived mistakes and played them off the variety of people who repeatedly appeared in these lives. And how after all Nora needed only one simple truth to save herself.Work your way through the library with Nora to discover some of your own truth. My husband and I play a variant of the library, an exercise of untangling decisions in reverse to discover how we got ourselves to a place in time or a circumstance. An example is the many events, accidental meetings, while and suggestions that led a non=academic young man from Cleveland and a horse-loving nerdy girl from Montana to end up together in a Lutheran teachers college. Even then,with such divergent backgrounds, how we were brought to meet, become friends and manage untangle other relationships, marry and to live together for 50 years seems miraculous.We all have our libraries. But if we manage to discover our true selves, we can stick with the book we checked out in the beginning.I highly recommend The Midnight Library. It can be read as a good story. It can be a cautionary tale. It can be a plan for self-examination. I enjoyed the developing relationship between Mrs. Elm and Nora Seed, how the older woman guided and taught, encouraging that seed in Nora to grow into the strong tree Mrs. Elm had become despite the regrets that even she still battled.INora's quotes of her favorite philosopher are now entered into my phone. Her  adventures and misadventures are mentally noted because I also learned from Mrs. Elm that age and limited wisdom doesn't give me a pass. I'm not there yet. Peace with myself is as distant for me as it was for Nora as she found herself in the library. Thanks to Matt Haig, I am not as clueless as she was. I don't have to live any superfluous lives, but only my own to figure out my next moves. No meticulous untangling of events to lead me to good choices. It's so much simpler. Life is not that complicated. Expectations make it complicated.It's really very simple to be happy if you aren't looking for pitfalls to spoil it.KL",The end can be the beginning,Verified Purchase,13 people found this helpful

Ironically, for a book obsessed with regrets, the best way to avoid regret is to skip this book. It is predictable and relies on hackneyed, ham-fisted writing. It never takes the time to develop its characters so it has to tell the reader everything, including why we should care. It’s moralizing and lecturing and stilted. To the extent anything about the book is subtle, it is the troubling and unnecessary implications that women should sacrifice themselves to save men or that a single unsuccessful suicide attempt will cure depression. But I may be giving the book too much credit. The overarching premise is to live the life you have, or something.I’m not going into the plot or characters in detail because the author didn’t bother so why should I?

Both her parents are gone, her brother hasn't spoken to her in years, and her best friend is in another continent and hasn't spoken to her in quite some time. She questions her own existence. Why be in a life where you have nothing left to live for? With that, she decides to take her own life. She consumes some pills, and the next thing she knows, it is midnight, and she is in a library surrounded by books, and greated by her old librarian from school. This isn't just any old library, it's her library. There is a huge book filled with her regrets, and each book surrounding her is a path that she could have chosen differently than the one she chose in her root life. So here it is. She has been given the chance to choose a different path in life, any one at all, and can try as many as she likes. Here's the catch, she can continue trying new lives so long as she is still alive in her root life, and she can remain in the new life so long as she is truly happy.

The premise sounded amazing, and as someone who suffers from anxiety and depression, this seemed right up my alley.But unlike another recent read with a similar theme (LaRue), The Midnight Library lacked depth. Weight. Substance. I think part of the issue had to do with the book’s structure. The chapters were so short as to be jarring. Even within the confines of a single “life,” we’d come to an abrupt semicolon in Nora’s story every 3-4 pages that ruined the narrative flow and emotional investment. I’m sure this was intentional; there’s no other reason to structure a novel like this. But it didn’t work for me.The other issue I had with this book was lack of continuity. I don’t mean continuity in terms of themes or events—all of that was fine. What I mean is that TML lacked a certain grounding force that kept us invested in all of Nora’s many lives. In LaRue, that grounding force was Luc, and, later, Henry. Addie’s relationships with those characters kept us emotionally invested in her story. Here, Nora <I>lacks depth</I> as a character (again, this is intentional—she is on a journey to find herself after all), and there’s nothing to ground her or the reader. Even Mrs. Elm is just a manifestation of Nora’s own subconscious, and, as such, lacks the required depth to sustain the novel.There were some things I enjoyed about the book, but overall, it just didn’t do it for me.

Like, a really, really bad day. So bad that at the end of it she decides she doesn't want to live and deliberately overdoses. (On antidepressants. Can you actually kill yourself with antidepressants? I thought they weren't very toxic. Well, I guess you can kill yourself with too much of anything...)Normally, of course, that would be the end. But then we wouldn't have a story, so something has to happen. Nora finds herself outside a building, with her watch and the building clock stopped at midnight. She enters and finds herself inside a library. Every book in this library is a life she could have lived. (There is some pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo about the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics to justify this scientifically. It's nonsense, of course. Insufficiently-known fact: Quantum mechanics is actually not the same as magic.) The librarian from her old school is in there. She explains that Nora can pick a life and live it. If she is satisfied, she can stay in that life. But if she is dissatisfied she will find herself back in the Midnight Library, where she can try another book. But there is some kind of ill-defined limit, after which Nora will die if she doesn't get a life.So Nora experiences a bunch of lives, where she learns lessons. We hear about the first several lives in some detail. This is the most disappointing part. It is where Matt Haig presents his not very profound insights into life. It is obvious from Nora's meditations that Haig fancies himself a philosopher. But his philosophy is trite. If you want insight from Thoreau's philosophy, I advise you to read Thoreau, not Haig.This kind of thing has been done before. For instance, I remember a story by Theodore Sturgeon (wish I could remember the name of the story), where a man is allowed to see how his life would have played out if he had made different choices. And there are many others. Reliving ones life with different choices is rather a common trope in science fiction.There's something about the way it works works in The Midnight Library that doesn't make sense. When Nora goes into a new life, she just appears in the mind and body of the her that would have existed had she made different choices. But she doesn't really. The Nora that is put into this situation is the Nora that attempted suicide. For instance, she shows up as the lead singer of a world-famous rock band. In this world she (the she of the new world, whom old Nora has just possessed) has written multiple hit songs. However, new Nora doesn't know any of those songs. She knows nothing of her past in this life except what she can suss out from looking at her social media accounts on her phone. She doesn't know the words of the songs she, the she of the life she has joined, composed. In another life she is a glaciologist, but she, new Nora, has no education in glaciology.Eventually we learn that this was all a con. She finds a life in which she is happy and decides to stay. but she can't:Everything was right, and yet she hadn’t earned this. She had joined the movie halfway. She had taken the book from the library, but truthfully, she didn’t own it.So she finds herself back in the Midnight Library, where everything is falling apart. Literally the only choice left to her is to find the book that represents her original life, the life she came from, and start writing in it. So she finds herself back in her old life, but now with a will to live. She drags herself out of bed, gets taken to the hospital and rescued, and seems as the book ends on the road to a better life.So the whole book is a con job designed to sell a bargain-basement generic life affirmation which you can find much more quickly in a million places on the Internet.","Well, that was disappointing.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

And on top of that be able to erase some of your regrets. The idea is amazing, but in my opinion the execution was slightly poor, it was like taking a philosophical class combined with some self-help book. Not to mention some of the choices that Nora got to experience were slightly over the top, and she did not really get to live any of the lives before returning back to the library. However, I must admit that the end made it all better and there was a moral to the story which I really liked.

Easy to wish we’d developed other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we’d worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga.”The Midnight Library is the account of Nora Seed and her near-death experience thanks to an intentional overdose of medication. On a perfectly ordinary day in her unremarkable, mundane life, Nora finds herself depressed and helplessly watching her life and her relationships unravel before her eyes. Her mother constantly treats her like a mistake, her father is dead, she is estranged from her brother and her best friend, lost her job, and to top it all off, her cat is fatally hit by a car. Fully feeling the weight of her shame and regret, Nora see’s no other way around the consequences of her poor choices and mismanaged opportunities. So, she downs a bottle of prescription anti-depressants and waits for the end of her suffering to come.She awakens somewhere between life and death, in the Midnight Library. After encountering a friendly face from her past, Nora quickly learns that this is not a dream and she is not in just any library. This library contains an infinite number of books, each one telling the story of an infinite number of parallel lives. Her lives. Lives she could have lived if she had made one, or two, or two thousand different choices. Nora is given the chance to step into any of these lives she chooses, to see what they may have been like, and if she finds one that truly brings her happiness, she will be allowed to stay. Before long, Nora realizes that there is no such thing as a life without certain disappointments and tragedy. There is no such thing as perfect happiness all the time, but that doesn’t make her life a failure.The Midnight Library illustrates a scenario most have fantasized about—getting the chance to rewrite our lives by erasing our regrets. The exploration of parallel lives is thoroughly interesting to consider, and readers will widely appreciate the insightful, illuminating message around satisfaction and life experience. Others, however, may argue that the premise alone carries this plot. The dialogue and characters, at times, feel shallow and distant, emotionless and even immature. While the themes themselves (mental health and valuing life) are thoughtful and important, the delivery may fall a little flat for some looking to feel a deeper connection.",It was okay.,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Did the author create believable and consistent characters?  Did the author manufacture vivid scenes and detailed locations?  Did the author include Easter eggs for the reader to find, anagrams of names (like in the Series of Unfortunate Events) or a play on words or an alliteration or metaphors or similes or puns?  Did the author include references to real world events or people or places that the reader can connect to?  Did the author explore a familiar concept in a new way?  Did the author give the characters words to say that connect with the reader and their view of life?  Did the author overuse actual dialogue or internal monologue to explain the story instead of relying upon actual action.There are so many options for the reviewer, just as there are so many options for the main character in this book.  Nora Seed finds herself in a library at the stroke of midnight, with lots of books around her and a librarian from her childhood, Mrs. Elm.  Each book represents a different version of Nora’s life, a life of joys and sorrows, people and places, events and tragedies that spawned from a single choice, a decision, or in the case of this girl so full of regrets, something that didn’t happen because she didn’t make that choice.Of course, there is the root life, the life that Nora remembers living, a life full of disappointments and settling, that led to her attempted suicide and her visits to the Midnight Library.  A moment in between, where she isn’t alive and in her body yet she isn’t dead (with the finality that means for self and others).  And there are all of those other lives that she now gets to explore, lives where she doesn’t remember any of that Nora’s life, but finds herself plopped there with a kid yet no memory of this child, or as a wife with no memory of sleeping with her husband, or as a glaciologist with no memory of what such a scientist knows, or as a pop star with no memory of the words to popular songs, or as a pub owner with no memory of what to do when closing.  Lives, but without the memories that led her there.An interesting thread running throughout the book is that of Hugo, another slider who explores his own lives.  Hugo and Nora meet up several times, though find that the other isn’t what they want and each chooses to go back to their own terminal, hers a library and his a video store.  I expected them to meet up at the end, as they had such a powerful connection through their sliding, both aware of themselves and of others, but no.  it wasn’t to be.  I’m not disappointed, just wondering if such a possibility exists, and if I will get this chance one day.  And I wonder how Hugo arrived at this point, if his was also a suicide, and if it only happened to suicides or lives so filled with regrets.A question I still have is about the character of Mrs. Elm (for Nora) or the uncle (for Hugo) and the place where these shamans or guides or facilitators resided.  Both sliders found themselves in an in-between place with a familiar character as the trusted one, not someone who used them but someone who in real life helped them find their own way.  A good person.  An older person who helped at a pivotal time in their life.  I find it cool that the author (Matt Haig) crafted a god-like character, not one who superimposes her/his will on you but one who is limited in what they can do by the physics of the world (a library or a video store) they are trapped in.  Not all-powerful.  Not desiring worship.  Not governed by human impulses (power and sex).  But a personal god whose sole interest was in the needs and wants of a single person, a much better concept (to me) than the invented gods of the modern world that seem interested in humanity as a whole (and worship and knee-bending and blind obedience and all of that stupidity).  If we could wipe away all of the old gods and create a new god for each person today, this would be the kind of god I would like to think about.  Though there is that question about universality, and whether everything we think and feel isn’t just arising from our own experiences, including all of this god-talk.I enjoyed finding things in this book.  Like the title, on page 31.  And the name of the band, a variation of the Kurt Vonnegut classic, Slaughterhouse Five.  And the name of the music shop that sounds like the idea behind all of the lived lives in this book, String Theory.  And the references to Bedford and Pottersville, connecting readers to the classic movie, “It’s a Wonderful Life”.  And life-fright being similar to stage-fright.  And the role of chess in the book, from its beginning to its end, something that used to be a major part of my own life as an educator.  And glitches in the library that stemmed from Nora thinking differently about death than she did in her root life.  And I had to look up “grasshopper suicide”, because the character told me to, and how many forms of life there are (almost nine million), and Frank Ocean (“Moon River” was awesome).Another interesting concept is that of time.  Time doesn’t pass for Nora in the real world as she pulls out numerous books from the library shelves, some exploring for a few minutes, others for hours or days or months.  Yet the clock never moves past 12:00 in slide after slide, life after life, universe after universe, until her thinking changes in such a way that she no longer regrets the choices she made in her root life.  And then the clock starts ticking and Mrs. Elm warns her that she must do just one thing in order to survive, pick that one book, and, wait, I don’t want to spoil it for you, but it gets to 00:03:48.If you want to know what happens to Nora, then read this book.  It is really good and worth your time.  And if you are the philosophical type (as I am), then keep a notepad and pen nearby so that you can write down the interesting thoughts and ideas that flow from the mind of Nora Seed, the questions she ponders, the truths she shares with the world.  And I will end on a final thought, one found on page 137, about life and what it is:  “…acres of disappointment and monotony and hurts and rivalries but with flashes of wonder and beauty.”  Something to think about.",Full of philosophical aphorisms & lots of Easter eggs & ideas about happiness and choices and life,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Within that library the shelves go on for ever with every book providing a chance to try another life you could have lived; to see how things would be different if you had made other choices.  Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’Bertrand Russell wrote that ‘To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead’.  Nora had once backed out of a Wedding, her excuse based on her mother's recent demise.  Even knowing that a person is like a city, with a few less desirable parts- dodgy side streets and suburbs, but that the good stuff makes it worthwhile, Nora still opted for the single life.‘Want,’ the Librarian tells Nora, in a measured tone, ‘is an interesting word. It means lack. Sometimes if we fill that lack with something else the original want disappears entirely. Maybe you have a lack problem rather than a want problem. Maybe there is a life that you really want to live.’ ‘Referring to a life she has just tried and returned from, Nora responds : I thought that was it. The one with Dan. But it wasn’t.’After another life cycle, Mrs. Elm, the Librarian, tells Nora that sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all but just lies.  When Nora questions Mrs. Elm why she just didn't tell her that the outcome would be the same in this new life as it had been in her root life; Mrs. Elm responds:  ""Because, Nora, sometimes the only way to learn is to live.’""When Nora  discovers a life she thinks she wants, she remembers the words of Mrs Elm on her first visit there: ""If you really want to live a life hard enough, you don’t have to worry . . . The moment you decide you want that life, really want it, then everything that exists in your head now, including this Midnight Library, will eventually be a dream. A memory so vague and intangible it will hardly be there at all.""Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small.

The beginning is quite dismal which is that base on which the book was written. We find Nora, our main character, in a depressing point in her life. Things are just going wrong. It seems that if something in her life can fall apart, then it is doing it. She has so many regrets on the way her life has went. She wonders ""what if"" about so many directions in her life. The depression eats her up so much that she decides she doesn't want to go on anymore. Enter, the midnight library. Here Nora finds that it is full of books. Every book is a ""what if"" in Nora's life. What if she decided to put all her efforts into her swimming, or her music, or her husband? Each one she gets to experience all her regrets only to find that life is full of regrets but it is what we make of them that counts.Anyone who has had these struggles will definitely identify with Nora.

The premise is intriguing, but the execution is lacking. Matt Haig could ask more of his readers and give us a more thoughtful book. We never get much beyond the premise: the midnight library is a personal purgatory/bardo/limbo space between life and death. The space is tailored to the person. For Nora, it is a library staffed by her beloved school librarian. For someone else, it might be a totally different space. In the Midnight Library, Nora is invited to examine her book of regrets and to select from an infinite number of books that contain her alternative lives that result from different choices. Nora ends up in the Midnight Library after a suicide attempt. She does not know yet if the suicide attempt will be successful. The beginning of the book shows us Nora’s unhappy life and then the rest is Nora popping in and out of different possibilities. Nora as the married owner of a country pub, Nora as the international pop star, Nora as the happily married mom, Nora with the live brother, Nora with the dead brother, etc. If you remember the old Quantum Leap television show, entering each life is a bit like that except it is always Nora jumping into another Nora. But like the television show, the root Nora does not know anything about the other Nora’s life. The story is predictable as it leads Nora to realize that many of her regrets were not her fault. Perhaps Nora’s experiences would help a reader realize that he or she is just not that important. For example, Nora’s failure to smile at a customer did not cause her beloved record store to go out of business. This book plays to the modern focus on the individual’s happiness and egotistical self-importance instead of a larger view of a life of purpose, work, love, and service which ironically can lead to more personal happiness or at least contentment. Never fear, there is a happy ending. This book is very readable, and the pages turn fairly quickly. The tension level remains low even when the library is crumbling or when Nora hits a snag in a life. Bottom line: better than some, worse than some. Warning: there are moments of preachiness and attempted suicide is a major feature. I did like this book more than How to Stop Time and if it helps anyone decide not to commit suicide then it is brilliant.","Good Premise, Light on Depth, Not Great, but Not Bad",Verified Purchase,

The Midnight Library is one of those books.  It is as exceptional as all the editorial reviews, taken together, score it.  But, know that it has its dullnesses.First the beautiful, moving and inspiring.  Nora, spiraling downwards, drowning in regrets and lack of any and all hopes, is struggling (to state it mildly).  She finds herself in the Midnight Library, attended by Mrs. Elm, the librarian.  In fact, Nora really, really, NEEDS to be in the Midnight Library.  There she reads her Book of Regrets.  It is thick and heavy.  Each book in the library is a life that is different from Nora's root life, but is a life that could have been Nora's root life if she had made a different choice, large or small.  Obviously, then, the number of books in Nora's Midnight Library is infiniteThe purpose of the library is for Nora to find a book (an alternative life) that she loves/prefers and for her to stay with that life and live it. Each time she enters another life and then leaves it to return to the library, the regret in question that she had of herself burns away, and her Book of Regrets becomes lighter.  Nora tries out some other potential lives that she could have lived - mega-famous rock star, glaciologist, married and co-owning a country pub and so on - but each one is not a good fit for her.  And so she returns to the Midnight Library.Mrs. Elm the librarian, is also a life counsellor/coach/mentor.  She teaches Nora how to search for what she is really after.  And so Nora learns, snippet of alternative life after snippet of alternative life, what she is seeking for.And so to what we have to forgive of The Midnight Library.  Some of it is charming and some stretches of it come across as cutesy; so that depends on your tolerance for cute and cutesy.  The Midnight Library itself is ""explained"" in the context of the highly abstract and speculative theoretical physics notion of multiverses and parallel universes.  We really don't need to know THAT for the library to exist; so it depends on your tolerance for a modicum of highly abstract physics concept.  This reader didn't care and didn't pay any attention to this.  And as for the guidance that Mrs. Elm offers to Nora, some of it comes across and wise and some twee.  So again, it depends on your tolerance.This reader came to fall in love with The Midnight Library.  But know that at 20% (reading on Kindle) I was unsure; and then at 20% an event happened that took me in wholeheartedly.  In conclusion, with forgiveness, the editorial reviews are a fair reflection of the beauty and wonder to be found within this story.  Yes, it is, or just might be, inspiring.","Beautiful, Moving, Inspiring, but Slow and Dull in Places",Verified Purchase,

How would something that you did or did not do impact another person’s decisions for better or worse? What if you could change actions that you regret? What if you could rewrite your past? With a different past, what would your present look like? This book’s protagonist, Nora Seed, is given multiple opportunities to explore the answers to these existential questions. Having arrived at “The Midnight Library” on the brink of death by suicide, she is mystified to encounter her school days librarian, Mrs. Elm, presiding over the scene. She guides Nora to examine the regrets of her past that have led her to want to die, and then she gives Nora a choice to open any of the books on the shelves. Each book that she chooses draws her into a life that she might have had if she had not experienced a regretful event in her past. Through book after book Nora experiences her life as it would have been if she had changed something that she regretted in her past. She drops into each life and stays just long enough to learn that she needs to move on and try another life. In her search for the perfect life, Nora learns more about herself and her family every time she lives in her alternate life. At long last, she realizes that there is no perfect life. There is only the life that she has and it is enough.Due to its focus on exploring some pretty deep psychological issues, I found the story less engaging than I had hoped. I also had a hard time relating to the mechanism of dropping Nora into her alternative lives as a stranger unfamiliar with the people, places, and situations she arrived in.

Granted, it's not a thesis on the subject, but the notion of someone going in and out their various lives is as silly as it is fascinating. Life doesn't open up like portrayed here. Every step you take actually limits the next steps you can take. Also, a physicist will tell you that life's like a Rubik's cube. One change changes everything else. So the novel - and its main character - is absurdly solipsistic and rather cruel. I kept wondering what happened AFTER she left one of her lives. The scenes of the people she left behind and what they did would be more interesting than her whining.

The Midnight Library is a moving, well-executed modern-day tale that champions humanity. One will truly be a different person after visiting The Midnight Library and Nora's encounters at 00:00. Matt Haig, without specifically saying so, has the main character explore Thoreau's famous line about humans ""lead[ing] lives of quiet desperation."" And he has done so in clever, very moving way. As well, Carey Mulligan shines as a fantastic narrator, bringing each character to life, using her own special talent by way of innuendoes, perfect pauses, lilts, even mundaneness - never once over-acting - something most American actors have need of to learn. Both Haig and Mulligan takes each person created in this story and brings them to characterized perfection. This book has been optioned as a movie. Can't wait to see how this story is brought to life in film. My only wish in this story was that Haig would have had the main character explore Christianity alongside legendary philosophers' points of view.

I met my wife in a bicycle class 25 some years ago. What if I didn’t make the decision to call her after the several-days class was over? That and so many other decisions over the years, sometimes seeming minor at the time, have had such long-lasting consequences.The Midnight Library is quite the fascinating opportunity for one character, Nora, to explore possible alternatives to her life when she believes her initial life has been a failure. She is given the opportunity to decide whether she would prefer to continue living in any of these alternative realities. It is intriguing to observe how those different paths do not lead to the future(s) Nora was expecting. Most interesting for me was realizing how what may seem wonderful to the alternative life seeker may have negative consequences for those whom one loves.Overall, the author does an excellent job, at least initially, in pacing the narrative and moving it along smartly. A few complaints that move this book down  to 4 stars. The ending is fairly predictable. The book does bog down a bit 2/3-3/4 into the narrative but then gathers speed for the journey to the end. When Nora spends time with her child in one life, the author describes Nora’s previous experience with her children in other lives as lasting “only a couple of minutes or so.” This statement conflicts with a previous chapter and life (as a vineyard owner) where the details of her life, involving a son, clearly could not have been ascertained in just a “couple of minutes.” Persnickety of me?

About 40 pages in you can basically fill in the entirety of the plot.

It’s written similarly, although the fable-like structure sits a bit strangely in the present day setting of the book. Each sentence is written to lead you to the main character’s revelation, much like the lines of the Alchemist. The characters other than Nora are, for the most part, flat and included solely to contribute to Nora’s pursuit of her “personal legend” (to put it in Alchemist terms). The overall points of the two books are also quite parallel, looking at the meaning of life and love. However, the Midnight library in my opinion approaches these questions in a less narcissistic manner (not just leaving a girl waiting for you in the desert because for some reason her “personal legend” is entirely dependent on yours).Overall I think the lessons the book intended to teach weren’t new. I’ve read plenty of other novels that tackle the same questions— however, I do think this book contains a few lines that added to the discussion and for that reason it is, in my mind, worthwhile.",The Alchemist Reincarnate,Verified Purchase,

Along with these themes I find that the story is a commentary on the idea of being a 'self-made' person and living out the dreams of others. How both of these avenues can ultimately lead to unfulfillment. It displays how important relationships are in life and how there is a delicate balance between the need for others and the need to dream.

'Realistically and rationally miserable' seemed to be an apt description of my life.

She's given the opportunity to ""try on"" lives, so to speak, and the chance to choose a different life for her consciousness to slip into and keep living. The only catch: if she finds herself dissatisfied with any of the lives she tries, she will be sent back to the Midnight Library, unable to enter that life again...and time is against her, as her body is dying in her root life.

Telling them that this is not true falls on deaf ears because the illness of depression lies to them telling them they are worthless. The author does an excellent job describing the person with depression in a matter of fact tone that is truly believable.

Wait until you can really take it all in.Between life and death there is a library, and wishing that library are an infinite number of books representing an infinite amount of pathways your life could have taken had you made any decision in your life differently. Would you do anything over if you had the chance to undo things you regret about your life?First of all, I have to give a big fat TRIGGER WARNING on this book as it delves deeply into depression, suicide, drug overdose, death of loved ones, feelings of extreme isolation, and a profound sense of regret. The first 25 pages are especially heavy in the suicide department and I had to actually stop reading it for a day to recover. Once you’re past that point, it’s “lightly” (I put that in quotes because it’s obviously not a light topic, but it isn’t as prominent of a theme) mentioned a few more times, but wasn’t nearly as difficult to get through.Second of all, this needs to be a book that you read in your lifetime. It really puts a lot of important things about life into perspective, including the following:1. Things are not always what they seem2. Every choice we make has both good and bad consequences, whether we are aware of those consequences or not3. Regretting choices you’ve made in your life changes nothing, just find a way to move past it and make a change moving forward.I told you, some seriously heavy stuff. And all packed into about 280.

She learns through experience how it’s not about the big regrets, but the little things you don’t think of that influences how you think and feel (and it’s affect on others). It’s about coming to terms with what you have, versus what you don’t have or think you want - and are you making choices for yourself or what you think others want for you? It’s also about depression and is enjoyable to read with humor and insight. I loved all the details and references and how it all came together.

Not a self help non fiction philosophical book. Please seek professional help, as this book is not going to provide you with a clinical game plan on how to manage your depression or make you non-suicidal. It is a feel good book to lift your spirits, and give you hope (see attachment). Additionally, suicide and depressions looks different to different people!!! Please don't read this fictional book thinking it's going to perfectly describe how depression and suicide looks/feels like for every single person on this planet.To start, I believe the author doesn't give you a full on visual of what this character looks like because when some people are suicidal/depressed, you can't even see yourself clearly and feel like an unimportant irrelevant shadow. I like how there wasn't much descriptive language (hair color, eye color, skin tone, etc) because suicide and depression isn't exclusive to just one 'look'.Throughout this novel, Nora is allowed to essentially live a regret (ie what would have happened if I stuck with swimming, became a pop star, traveled/live x, married x), and would come back to the library when she felt disappointed in that 'life'. The whole point of this was to broadcast how we thinking doing x would led us to live a perfect happy life, when perfect life is impossible. Even when you get everything you want, there are still going to be negatives. I know I get caught up thinking about how my life would have been perfect if I did or said xy&z, when in reality, it probably wouldn't have been as perfect as I thought it would be. In these alternative lives were she got what she wanted, she realizes all the sacrifices that she had to make or give up that she didn't think she would, and how everything wasn't sunshine and rainbows like she thought it was going to be.Lastly, I thought this book also highlights the butterfly effect really well. I often overlook the everyday small and mundane things I do, and feel like I don't always make a huge difference (esp. with quarantine). In the book, it shows how her teaching piano for an hour with one student has a bigger impact on his life than she thought. For me, I felt it highlighted how things would have obviously been different if she made different decisions, but the life she was living wasn't as worthless as she thought, and it was something worth fighting for.I read this book in one night (it's 288 pages), and would highly recommend!",IGNORE TOP REVIEWS,Verified Purchase,

Depending where you are on your journey in this life, this book may or may not speak to you but for me, it showed up just when I needed it most.These days, it’s not often that I find a fiction book outside of a classic novel, that truly engages me. This book isn’t a complicated read. It’s simply a story of a young woman who finds herself lost and holding onto lots of regret. The story shares a timeless and welcomed reminder of how precious this one life we have is.I personally related to the story and the struggle to appreciate not only what we have but more importantly, who we are and our value in this life. Every decision we make or don’t make has an impact and unlike Nora, the main character, we will most likely never know the far-reaching consequences of all our choices but we can be assured that every choice matters as well as every thought.The “story” we tell ourselves about ourselves isn’t always truth and sadly, the story is often someone else’s story that we took on as our own.  The beauty of this life is that we always have the choice to change our perspective. We can choose to see light or dark, truth or untruth.
