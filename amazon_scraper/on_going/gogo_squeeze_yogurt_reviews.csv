I'll be buying these again. I do wish the pouches had more in them. These have only 3oz compared to cups that usually have 5 or 6oz. For the record I've never rolled my Jeep nor did I eat cup yogurt while driving. :DI do want to add, these really helped settle my nausea. I have some knee issues and once in a while I'll take a Vicodin I'm prescribed to. When I started to feel nauseous I felt like I had to eat something and this actually settled it quickly.

There is no need to refrigerate this unless it is opened. Once it is opened it either needs to be consumed right away or put in the fridge for no longer than 24 hours after which time it should thrown away.To consume, just screw off the top and suck up like a straw while squeezing the package into your mouth. It was easiest if I titled my head back to ""eat"" it. The blueberry does not taste like blueberry to me but just a conglomerate of berries.  The berry flavor tastes mostly like strawberry to me.Each pouch is one serving of 90 calories with 15 from fat, 5% saturated fat, 3% cholesterol, 12g of sugar, and 4g of protein, etc. See photo two for the full nutrition label and ingredients. Cultured reduced fat milk and can sugar are the first two ingredients in each.In summary, this tastes like a sugary milk snack to me and it lacks the beneficial cultures of yogurt. I think this is better than candy but I do not believe this is as healthy as real yogurt. It does taste pretty good and it is smooth and creamy. Also the fruit comes from either blueberry or strawberry/raspberry puree. After having tried this, I would not buy it unless I needed a portable source of milk protein. Also, at the current price of $49.88, it is expensive as it comes to a little more than .83 cents per 3 ounce serving.UPDATE March 9, 2019 - I gave some to my Postman and he really likes these. He said they taste very good to him.UPDATE March 11, 2019 - I gave these to my boyfriend and he said they are ""not bad really"" but it was ""difficult to get past the serving method"" (meaning having to sip it up like a straw).","Portable, sweet, thick yogurt but without any live & beneficial cultures",Flavor: Berry/BlueberrySize: 3 Ounce (Pack of 10)Vine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? ),3 people found this helpful

At 3 Oz per portion, an adult like me can easily eat 3-4 in a row before feeling satisfied. They are similar to the brand Yop we used in France and that correspond to liquid yogurt. I mention France because they are made in France.What I like about them:- Easy to conserve. No need to keep them in fridges. Therefore easy to keep readily available.- Good ingredients, all natural.- Good portions for small kids.- Pouch can be closed after opening (I am not sure why because it is very small to start with)- Easy to handle.- Good tasteWhat I like less or completely dislike about them:- Not environment friendly. That is a lot of packaging for such a small quantity.- Expensive pouches at almost one dollar per pouch. When compared to any regular yogurt, the price is maybe 3 times more expensive per Oz.- Not frankly suitable for adults.In conclusion:Keeping in mind the clients target (kids),  these pouch are a great addition for any family. The taste and quality is good. As for me, I am always feeling uneasy about them since I cannot satisfy myself with one only and about the environmental impact.3 stars.","Not environmentally friendly... Yet, good taste and quality.

I've only had cold ones because that's the only way I eat yogurt.  I'm glad they are shelf stable though because that's a great convenience for storage.These taste ok, but they are like a kid's yogurt in that they are very sweet and the flavors are sweeter and stronger than natural flavors would be.  I was actually very suprised to learn they didn't have HFCS in them.  They are blended, and thick and creamy, but sweeter than the Greek yogurt we usually eat.  Still, we all like these.  The only problem any of us has with them is that they only contain 3 ounces of yogurt and we'd prefer twice that.  They even have a lid that screws back on, in case you want to save the rest, which we find strange.  I think the packaging is a bit much- it seems like they put more thought and effort into it than they did how much yogurt someone might want- this is only going to satisfy kids under 6 or 7, I think.It might be that they were thinking they were making a toddler product, but many older kids and adults will like this too.The pouches fit well in just a clear plastic bin in the fridge.

Is this product designed just for kids? I think the serving size needs to be bigger, even for kids.2) Too much plastic -- each pouch has a plastic twist-off top designed to allow you to refrigerate the unused portion of a pouch, but who isn't going to suck the contents of a pouch down at one brief sitting? So the manufacturer should lose the environmentally unfriendly twist tops and just give each pouch a standard tear-off top.3) Plastic toothpaste-tube-style dispenser hole a turn-off. Again, squeezing a normal foil pouch would probably dispense the product without the need for utensils just as well.4) Even the box containing the pouches has an odd opening perforation that needs to be re-thought.Finally, these little suckers are EXPENSIVE.

I did notice an funky sort of aftertaste, a little bit bitter and not quite something I could put my finger on; if I had to guess I would think it is just the ultra pasteurization process and the change it has on the milk's overall flavor.  Personally, I didn't love squeezing this product out, I would have rather spooned it into my mouth but I can see the appeal of it being less messy for kids.  The convenience of these is great but there sure is a lot of waste that isn't easily recyclable.
