( I only add this because people said they receive fakes)SHORT ANSWER:  These filters are great and I can tell a difference when I used a higher grade filter but that can vary depending on the level that I started and how clean the house was previously by a high filter.  Don’t forget to check the air filter regularly because a dirty filter can cause the coils to freeze up and will need to be turn off to unfreeze.  Don’t forget to have your AC/heater check and make sure you tell them to clear the line (they may not normally do it, but should.)LONG REVIEW:I started using 1500 (at the time the purple label) and have used up to 2800.  I live in a place where I get very sick because of all the pollution, pollen, dust, and in the winter smoke from miscellaneous burned things from across the border.How well do these work …..well that depends on how you live your life.We for the most part keep our windows and doors closed and always run the fan on a/c (heater) unit so it is alway cleaning the air which was recommended to us.  If you have pets and open your window and door a lot and keep them open it will be hard to keep your air cleaner.  The cleaner you have your house the better it will be vacuuming, dusting, etc….We have box fan with 20 x 20 filters on it.  We tried using, them then we stop, and now we are using them again. We started using 1500 and upgraded recently to 1900.At first I thought when we used the 2800 filter it was really only a physiologically made me feel better, but I up graded our fan filters from 1500 to 1900 and notice they appeared to get dirty fast.  After that observation I believe they make a difference.How fast can it clean your air?  Depend on your life (mentioned above) and house size.  I have notices that it can take about month or so to clean our small house.There is a visual difference the higher you go.  The higher filter look different with more pleats and a stronger gauge on the wire across the front and back.KEEP IN MIND**If you don’t change your filter when it gets dirty it can freeze the coils because of poor air circulation and you will need to leave the air conditioner off for a while to melt the coils.**Regular maintenance can prevent problems make sure you have your ac/furnace is check year and TELL THEM TO CLEAR THE LINE (they don’t always do this automatically) and can get clogged and cause flooding.**AC not turning on also check the batteries.I’m sure there are more, but these either happened to me personally or I heard about them and wanted to pass this knowledge along.",Worked for me,Size: 16 x 25 x 1Style: 2-PackVerified Purchase,11 people found this helpful

Easily pairs with the filter and updates all the time based on current airflow.  The app tells me that I bought the filter in early April and it still has 38% life left and is rated good.  It is now early July so I got 3 months use and maybe another month or two to go.  We will see.  Without this, I would have been paranoid and replacing filters every 2 to 3 months or perhaps stupid and waiting for 9 months because I would not be thinking about my filter and would not know it wasn't working.

We've been buying the filtrete filters for some time, to help clean up the indoor air during heating season and filter air during the rest of the year (using furnace to circulate air when pollen bloooms).In conjunction with our IQAirPro this really helps keep our indoor air quality up to snuff. When you first put this one on your furnace you will be able to tell the first time your furnace turns on. Stale and musty always seems to disappear in a few minutes....If you have filthy ducts and don't do other things to keep your dust and dander down, a brand new filter like this will only work for a very short time.Compared to the 1900 filters there IS a difference in this one. Smells will come out of your air and you will smell EVERYTHING that's been hiding below threshold! (we call it smell abatement, right after a filter change, to go find the culprits that weren't noticed before and deal with them)If you have someone in your house that's really sensitive, these are worth the extra and it is noticeable. If you have someone in your house that is really sensitive, these may not go the 3 months, so buy a few and always keep one on hand. They are fully plastic wrapped and sealed so they will 'keep'.I would recommend the Filtrete brand, they have been a quality product. Not all ultrafine filters are the same and these are ones that WORK.

I definitely noticed a significant difference going from the cheap blue filters to this. There is a lot less noticeable dust build up on my wooden furniture around air ducts afterwards. It also seems to do better with pet smells throughout the house. One drawback is i'm fairly certain i notice less air flow through the vents (weaker current). I can't accurately compare if it effects heating/cooling costs (if it has less flow through, that should mean you have to run the unit longer to achieve the same temp), but I imagine there's a slight difference in opperating costs. Also note this may only be as good as the mount you have in your air handler that holds it down - i had a single metal bar that only held down one side of this adequately, allowing a fair amount of blow by air that wasn't being passed through the filter. Wedged in some boards to increase the effectiveness of the filter though.Next time I buy filters I'll probably step down a rating in MPR, hopefully allowing more air flow through. Eventually I'll just replace the air handler and get true 4"" hepa filters and a blower that will allow adequate flow.",Keeps smells and dust down!,Size: 16 x 25 x 1Style: 2-PackVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

I took them out of the packaging, pulled the tab out, and my iPhone X found the first filter.  I named it so I would know where it was in my home, then installed it.  I took the second one out, pulled the tab out, and my iPhone found it OK, but the app gave the same name to that filter as the one I had already installed.  There was no way for me to change it.  I moved forward with the other two and the same thing happened.  All four were named the same thing, so I chose to delete one of them, but all four were deleted instead of one.  When I tried to discover them again, absolutely NOTHING worked.  I called their technical support.  The first person did everything she knew to do and still nothing.  I was transferred to second-level support and everything he suggested never worked.  It was then that he suggested pulling all four filters out of the ceiling and reinserting the tabs in each of them in an attempt to start from scratch.  I said no thank you because I live alone and have a bad back.  In the first place, I don't even know if the tabs can fit back into the little slit that they were originally in so as to ""activate"" them so bluetooth can recognize them.  I would have had to have done that for all four of them, so I just passed.  Over the last three months I have attempted to discover them multiple times by standing under the grates in the ceiling, but the Filtrete app has not once EVER recognized them again.  Don't waste your money on these.  Buy a filter to perform in the manner you want it to, but forget about the bluetooth and the app trying to read the air in your home.UPDATE 7-6-18:  Just pulled one out of the ceiling, reinserted the tab as best as I could, and attempted to discover it via my iPhone X and bluetooth.  Absolutely nothing, and I tried it twice.  Stuck it back up in the ceiling and gave up.
