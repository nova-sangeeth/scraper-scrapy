  Looks like Otterbox just isn't what it used to be.  Premium priced cases are now made in CHINA and the quality isn't even close to what they used to be. Didn't fit well or feel good in hand. Sent  both a Commuter and an Otterbox Defender back this week.  The Defender's holster clip would not hold the latch in the kickstand position and would click off and the phone would fall over setting on a desk every time ........And this was new, right out of the box.  Sad situation. Called Otterbox ,  no warranty since I had bought it on the internet !

  I was completely shocked that my camera lens fractured when the phone was dropped being properly installed in this otter box.  My previous otter box protected my iPhone 6 for four years.  Even made it thru a rollover car accident.  I’m speechless about the failure of this new otter box.

  If you've had other Otterboxes in the past, you will immediately notice that it's not as ""premium"" as it used to be. The two part construction of this item will combine with your phone to feel vaguely solid, but it is immediately apparent when you remove both parts from the box that it's nothing more than a shockingly thin piece of plastic and some hardened rubber. I assume that Otterbox's engineers have alot more experience than me, a guy writing a product review, but this particular product doesn't inspire confidence.

  This is not the same commuter case as before with older iphone models.  The case is very slippery, and has lost some of the grip and protection that I used to buy this case for.  After using this for a few weeks and having some near missed drops because of the lack of grip, I am going to have to spend more money on a different case.  Please bring back the old case!!!

  This does not feel like the Otterbox I knew and loved. This feels cheap and only around the sides is there some ""rubber"" texture to help with gripping the phone so it doesn't slip through your hands. It fits well, but the back is plastic and slick.  This feels like a $10 case at more than 3 times that price. I have concerns that it will not protect my phone in a fall from any height.

  I have to start by saying... I am a LONG TIME Otterbox fan...,My last 4 phones have had Otterbox cases, and I have had no problems with them... in fact... I was a bit of an Otterbox evangelist...,When I got my upgrade to a New iPhone 11, I knew what company I was going to go for...,HOWEVER... I was sorely disappointed...,My cases in past have been the Symmetry, sleek case, which maintaining the beauty of the phone while keeping it safe from accidental drops (I have three kids, it happened more than I EVER cared to admit).,However, they did not have the Symmetry available for my phone (well, not technically true, they only had it in the BRIGHT YELLOW, not quite my style).,BUT, they had other Otterbox cases, so I thought... MUST be one I can find... and it's a brand I trust...,So I found this one....,When I received it I was slightly underwhelmed by the two different parts. Not entirely sure what the purpose of the softer rubber one was, not really knowing why it was in two parts, but, it fit on my phone, was a bit bulkier than what I was used to, but it appeared to do the job... UNTIL I did ANYTHING other than holding it like a glass egg with mittens.,The phone dropped (again, it happens a lot with children, unfortunately), and landed flat on the front screen.,When I saw it from afar, I was like, that sucks, but I have an AWESOME case on it, so it will be fine, right?,WRONG!!!,Upon picking the phone up, I notice that the ENTIRE front screen is SMASHED... I'm talking TOTAL Annihilation, not just a little sliver...,I was confused as to how this could happen, as SURELY, the case is tested (I refer to the description of the case, found below again for ease).,I was no longer enjoying 'non-stop texting even when my device took a tumble.' And it was CLEAR from the point of impact (the part that actually hit the ground and caused the smash)...,You see, the soft inner layer, which is advertised as an impact absorber, is in fact the opposite. The phone fell flat on the screen, and it was the soft rubber (where the volume control is) that bent in on the impact (unlike the hard material that ACTUALLY did the job it was meant to do). As the soft inner layer crumbled on the impact, the front glass hit the ground RIGHT at that point, sending shockwaves through the phone, to the tune of £200 for my repair.,£200 it's costing me to fix the glass of my phone which was supposed to be protected byt this (not OVERLY cheap case) from a company that built a case 'DESIGNED TO PROTECT, that will perform when you need it most.',NEEDLESS to say, I am VERY disappointed... and will NOT be buying an Otterbox case, upon the arrival of my fixed phone from Apple (It was 2 weeks old for crying out loud!!!),2-Layer protection: Soft inner and hard outer layers absorb and deflect impacts while protecting from scratches and dings. You enjoy non-stop texting even when your device takes a tumble. (NOT AT ALL... Soft inner layer CAUSED the issue, in my humble opinion, and I def was not enjoying my texting... couldn't flipping read the screen!,Slim design: this sleek case profile featuring a polycarbonate outer shell makes commuter Series seriously pocket-friendly. (I'll give them that, it fit in my pocket just fine... BUT I am a BIG guy, so that was never going to be an issue, I got big pockets!!!!),Dust protection: block out dust, dirt and pocket lint (I mean.. sure... it did that... but what case wouldn't?),Designed to protect: tested by US. Built for you. Otter box Certified Drop+ protection means 24+ tests over 238+ hours, which certify that this slim, low-profile case performs when it matters most (DESIGNED TO PROTECT WHAT?????? What tests didnt include a drop onto the glass, or am I just that unlucky? Perhaps)...,Overall, sad times... I've loved boasting about my OtterBox in past... but long gone are those days.

  If you want a really bulky case that doesn’t stay on your phone well and offers no protection, this is the case for you! Dropped my phone 2 times, first one on gravel, you can see the point of impact I drew the arrow pointing to, where the case should have been protecting, the second time I dropped it on a flat floor and it smashed a camera out. Otter box has turned to garbage and had cost me hundreds. There are better options out there I’m sure.,The way I see it otter box owes me an iPhone 11

  I bought 3 cases for my iPhone 11, all of them fell short of protecting my phone if dropped.,This otter box cover is the best with its inner cover and outer cover I thought it would be to big but no, it’s just right and it feels quality , good grip and yes it’s more expensive than the cheap rubbish out there but believe me this is a great case that will protect your expensive phone if dropped .

  Another disappointment from Otter. Tried this and there tough box. Turns the large iPhone 11 into a brick. Case comes in two pieces and the rubber shock proof part seems like it would pick up every bit of dirt going. Going to stick with Griffin surviver series that I’ve had on all my old iPhone as there slimmer and stiffer and sits nicer in the hand.

  This is an absolute tank of a case, and provides probably the most protection possible. I had similar for my old iPhone SE, and it was perfect, but the 11 is so much bigger that the case turns an already large phone into a brick. Buy if you want ultimate protection but look elsewhere if you intend on even attempting single handed usage.

  just got the case delivered today, super fast shipping. so far the case looks good and i am not seeing anything wrong with it. looks pretty great for the price but i will update my review after i have it in the phone for a few days.,UPDATE: the case fits the phone really well and it does look pretty protective. the buttons are easy to push and the case does come up around the phone but i would still get a screen protector just in case.

  This is amongst the best of the many clear cases I have tried. Not too slippery, clear plastic, good fit. However Spigen saw fit to print manufacturing and branding text on 3 of the 4 sides. Pretty dumb.

  I was looking for a clear case to show off the purple color of my iPhone 11. I wanted it to be sturdy but not too thick, and this really fits the bill for me. I’m hoping it doesn’t yellow over time, so I’ll check back in if my opinion changes.,The only thing I don’t love about this case is the wording on the side. It’s not super noticeable, but it does take away from such a simplistic case. I won’t dock points though because for the price I think this case hits it out of the park. I paired this case with a Spigen glass screen protector and am very pleased.,Note: the back of this case has another brand’s lanyard product attached with a 3M sticky and it works great. I also placed a Popsocket on this case with no problems.

  I am pleased with the case as it's clear allowing the beautiful color of the iPhone 11 show through. Case has a good feel in the hand allowing me to grip the phone so it doesn't slip out. Buttons and access points function well. Laying the phone on the face, the slight raised edges of the case keep the glass from touching the table surface. When resting on it's back, there are 4 corner raised areas to keep the phone raised a bit and cameras do not touch the table surface. I have not experienced drop protection yet with the case, but the TPU edging should help. It's not the most rugged case out there, but for daily use at work and about at the cost, I like it very much. Previously, I used a wallet case which was functional adding space for credit cards, ID, and cash. But it hides the beauty of the phone and can be a bother when taking photos or videos. Taking photos with the simpler Spigen case is a breeze. Love the iPHone 11 wide angle lens and the zoom system transitions between lenses wonderfully.

  I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to an iPhone 11. I got the purple one and wanted to show off the color. After watching many YouTube reviews on different cases, I decided on this one. It looked nice in the beginning. But like everyone else mentioned it’s a dust, oil, and fingerprint magnet. I clean it daily. What really grinds my gears aside from what I’ve already described is... I am not hard on my phone. It sits in the side pocket of my purse when I’m on the go. However, I noticed there is some little nicks on the inside of my case and it’s scratched the back of my phone. I have no idea how they have gotten there. I haven’t had my phone for a month. I’m so disappointed.

  I can not say enough about how great I think this case is. I had same one for last cell. I actually didn’t realize how much better it was until I bought a similar but less expensive case. The lips were not raised enough for screen after putting on my screen protector. But most noticeable was there was no protection for the camera lens on the back side. I went through all my purchase history to find exactly the brand I purchased last time. I got the  new 11 with 2 cameras and they were so vulnerable in that case. This case has plenty of lip to protect. I used a pencil for the example. Also, no I don’t get anything out of posting this. I just read so many reviews trying to determine what to buy that I understand how helpful a very thorough review is. The last case I had did separate a bit from rubbery sides to hard plastic back after more than a year but it was just a couple inches on the sides. I was still able to use it and it didn’t compromise the look or protection of the case.  Bottom line, I highly recommend this case.

  I got a generic clear TPU case in a plastic pack.  The plastic pack did not have Spigen brand and case does not Spigen engrave on the side, there is no protective sticker as shown in the picture..  I have bought a many Spigen case for my previous phones now I need to find better brand.

  Con todos los iPhones que he tenido siempre he comprado las fundas de Spigen porque considero que son las que más protegen el móvil. Una vez puestas se ajustan perfectamente al móvil y la sensación de robustez es grande. Sin lugar a dudas las recomiendo. Ahí os dejo 2 fotos de cómo ha quedado mi nuevo iPhone 11 con la funda que me acaba de llegar.

  Exact fit for the iphone 11.  The lens or the screen on either side do not touch the surface when you lay the phone on a flat surface.  The case is surprisingly not heavy. Only minor observation is that finger prints are visible but hey, that's a lot better than having those prints on your the phone itself.  For its price (£4.99), definitely a bargain for a top quality product.

  UPDATE - helped my phone survive a fall off my road bike going full speed on a highway. Got away with a small chip to the screen protector and the screen itself. Had it not been for this cover my phone would have been a goner :),Original review:,A great brand, I bought from them 2 years ago for my samsung galaxy s9 and that phone survived countless drops, throws, swims, you name it. Affordable, durable quality that looks great so I went into my history and found the brand for my new iphone 11 order. Wasn't disappointed when my order arrived today.,Also I saw previous reviews complaining about the protective sticker not coming off and it came off absolutely fine for me you just have to have some nails (real nails, no acrylic ones) :).

  I'm one of the very, very few people who cannot use the apple air pods. No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!,The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.,I love these headphones, they have already changed my life for the better!

  I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.,Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.

  Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.,With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.,Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.,The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.,Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.,Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.,All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.

  Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.,UPDATE REVIEW...,This is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted.  Thanks TOZO

   I upgraded from Tozo T8 to the T10 and also own a pair of wireless earbuds from a well known Brand associated with fruit, and have to say I am very impressed with the TOZO T10 in comparison to the other that I own.,First of all, They are great value. The set up was very straight forward and connected to my devices bluetooth in a few seconds. When you pick the earbuds up out of the case they automatically attach to each other and have useful light indicators. The case also has light indicators to show the charge level which is very helpful.,The waterproof feature is very useful as I'm often worried about headphones if it is raining etc.,They fit in my ear nicely and don't fall out as there is a selection of attachment earpiece sizes to best fit the size of your ear.,Nice presentation in the box and good clear instructions.,The sound is really nice, I have listened to a selection of songs and audiobooks etc and the sound is up there with some of the best sounding earbuds I've used, very clear with good sound range / overall levels and I'd definitely recommend them!,The sound range distance is good, I walked downstairs in my home and continued to listen to the headphones no problem (under 10 metres).,The case and earbuds feel very premium, there is even a lanyard included for carrying around your neck or hanging on a hook etc.,For the price you can't go wrong, also supports wireless charging which I might have to try out as well!,I've added an unboxing video plus some photos to help show what's included too.,Thanks for reading my review and hopefully this might've helped in your decision to try out these brilliant headphones if you do decide to get these. Happy listening!

  So I bought these headphones for a single purpose - use in the hot tub (I already use AirPods for running/exercise and some noise-cancelling Bose headphones for when I'm at work)... I have to admit they were a bit of a shot-in-the-dark and I honestly wasn't expecting much from them, especially as I used to have some cheaper headphones for running that were terrible, and really put me off the 'budget' price point.,Now these are clearly not AirPod or Bose standard, but frankly for the price they sound excellent. Crystal clear treble and more than enough low-end for me... using my go to track (Wilderness from Clannad's Anam) they have good definition and far exceeded my expectations.,They are much larger than AirPods, and you MUST ensure they are correctly positioned (with the right-sized rubber ends on) or the sound quality drops dramatically - but after a few minutes of getting this right (as a one off) they more than meet the requirements. The size isn't really a hinderance to them, because it lets them sit in the ears quite comfortably - but your mileage might vary (with ear size).,I haven't had them long enough to gauge battery life, but the wireless charging feature of the case works fine from my standard charging mat.,So the TL;DR... really good value for money and surprisingly high sound quality - Recommend!,(For full disclosure they cost £29.99 when I bought them and TOZO have offered me an extra wireless charger, no strings attached - but the later has not influenced my review, other than encouraging me to write it).

  I bought these to take on holiday to Spain, I intended lots of beach and poolside music listening and didn't fancy the wires or bulkiness of my existing headphones. In ear and wire free was a must and having compared many of the headphones on Amazon I ended up choosing these.,I wasn't expecting much for the price paid, but first impressions were very positive. The packaging is excellent and suggests premium quality. The charging case is much sturdier than I imagined and the earbuds themselves smaller than I imagined (in a good way).,I used the earbuds and charging case daily whilst on holiday for anything from 1-5 hours at a time without any issue. The sound quality is surprisingly very good, a much better bass than I was expecting. Everything seemed nice and clear. I never intended to keep using them daily on my return from holiday, but I have. They are fine when walking too, I expected them to fall out but they don't. I'm not sure I'd trust running in them though.,The jury is still out on the long term longevity and battery life a few months down the line, but I'll be happy to revisit this review and update it in a few months if my opinion changes.

   I have to say these ear buds are great quality both made and for comfort worked straight out of the box and you can even carge the box with a QI wireless charging pad or through the cable it has different size ear buds for comfort and ive included a small video but if your thinking of buying some then just spend a little bit more and buy these because the sound quality is great

  I don't usually write reviews, or bother others with my thoughts on things, but since Samsung had such a chance to hit a home run with these, but boy did they miss, I figured I'd help others who were looking for the same things I was in these. I listen to mostly podcasts, so the lackluster sound quality is ok, I can deal with that in, but the idea that irks me is the poor sound quality these have all around, not just in podcasts or music. I hate to hold a phone when talking on it, and everyone I have spoken to on these has been disappointed with how I sound to them (sounds like I'm an in a tinny room with lots of echoes), along with my disappointment in the sound quality of those on the other end as well.

  I had a lot of hope in these earbuds. As a previous owner of the Iconx 2018, I was expecting some of the same feature passed down. For instance, on the Iconx 2018, you could set the main earbud to left or right. This was handy when running with my Garmin. Connection issues happen when the main earbud is set to the opposite ear of the arm your watch is own. So the watch is on your left arm and main bud is in your eight ear. This causes the connection to drop out continuously. This is something great the Iconx had. You could change it to any ear. This feature is lost to the Galaxy Buds. I have to change the watch to my opposite arm to combat this, and it's quite awkward,The biggest let down was they had no internal storage. This was very disappointing, as this was my favorite feature on the Iconx. I understand they wanted to cut the size down but they took away what made the Iconx so great.,I haven't decided whether I want to return them or not. If someone can tell me how to set the main earbud or get around this, I'll change my review. This doesn't mean telling me to move my watch to the other arm.

  I've had these now for about a week.  Here's the pros and cons., - Great fit.  They fit nice and snug and don't feel at all like they want to come loose.  I've had many other nice (wired) earbuds, and some that come with different ear hole cups.  None have been large enough to fit snug.  The large size cups and rings on the Galaxy buds fit perfect.,- Sound quality is good.  Not great, but good.,- The charging case is nice and works well.,- Battery life seems good.,- Bluetooth performance is poor, and I'm talking about range, not sound.  I have an S9, and this phone works great with my gear wearable and my car stereo via bluetooth.  I normally have my phone in my back pocket, and the buds do not work well at all with it there.  In my front pocket its better, but if I turn my torso at all in either direction, the sound cuts out and gets choppy right away.  These two factors alone are enough for me to wish I hadn't spent the money on these.  I should have waited another year for version 2.  The phone simply needs to be too close to the buds for them to work well.

  Just had them a couple hours and pairing them was easy. I love these, i have small ears and they fit great. The bass is good for me; i don't get why people criticized it.If you want to increase volume keep in mind that the buds have their own volume control. Fast shipping made these worth every penny. Will update review if anything changes.

  The sound quality is very good. The carrying case is more compact than I had originally thought, and they pair with my phone before I can even put them on.,I like to sleep with music playing, but wired headphones are a bit difficult to do that with. I was hoping these would be a fantastic solution to that issue, and it sort of was. Sort of. They make it extremely easy for me to fall asleep, but when I wake up, they're both out of my ears. I've heard that some people can go the whole night without them falling out, but that has never happened to me so far. Don't get me wrong, I love these earbuds, I just wish they would stay in at night.

  I'll start with the headline...,The out of the box rubber fitting fit my ears great and for the last week I havent had any uncomfortably or issues. But this morning I decided to see how the other rubber fittings felt in my ears and WOW....,All 3 configurations 'fit' my ear; but I found that the medium inner ear and the small 'wing tip' piece fit my ears PERFECTLY. Wow I cant believe I was wearing them wrong this whole time...,Ratings:,Sound quality: #2,The sound quality is 2nd only to Bose, for $70 less.,Looks: #1,This is obviously opinion based but because of features like the case style, actual bud looks, and they dont have the douche-vibes that you get with wearing apple airpods thus making the Galaxy Buds the best option.,Customization: #1,If you have a galaxy phone...forget it man the customization of the first gen Galaxy Buds is already light years above the competition.,Features: #1,Wireless charging, touch pad on ear buds, command customization, sound customization, EAR PIECE CUSTOMIZATION,Value: #1,$70 less than Bose, $30 less than airpods and far more features.,-Galaxy Buds are the reason I FINALLY got rid of my LAST apple product, airpods 🤮🤮🗑🗑

I'm disappointed and want my money back.

  Llevo usándolos 2 meses, al principio el volumen del sonido me impresiono bastante por que no estaba a acostumbrado a tanto, en si no se escuchan tan fuerte y me parece que los bajos de los audífonos son precarios. Tienen brillo en las notas altas y creo que se satura un poco el sonido en los medios. Depende de géneros y gustos en si. Un día salí a correr con ellos y parece ser que el auricular derecho no se acopla bien a mi odio y se me callo mientras corría. No e visto a nadie hablar sobre su resistencia a caídas y  tengo que decir que solo se me callo una vez pero fue suficiente para que le salieran 2 rasguños. Funcionan bien pero me gustaría que fueran sumergibles para poder lavarlos rápido cuando están sudados. Otra cosa que debo recalcar es la batería que no se si mi modelo tiene ese defecto pero le dura menos de lo que debiera; a veces me impresiona el hecho de que estoy en mi casa y me sale una notificación de batería baja  cuando haciendo cálculos no han superado las 10 horas de uso (con carga de la caja incluida). Si los usas mucho tendrás que cargarlos cada 2 días. Mi recomendación final es que si los vas a usar exclusivamente para el gimnasio te compres unos mas baratos, con mas batería y con mayor agarre en tu oreja por que sinceramente cuando estas entrenando (en serio) la calidad de sonido es lo ultimo en lo que te vas a fijar lo digo por experiencia. En cambio si los vas a usar para caminar por la calle, estar en el trabajo, escuela o solo eres muy fan de samsung entonces si lo recomiendo.

  Everyone is posting that there isn’t a difference between these and the 1st gen.  This is misleading and inaccurate.  Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement.  The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing.  This isn’t anecdotal.  It’s been tested and proven to be faster.,Also, if you opt for wireless charging, buy the case with the gen 2 AirPods and you’ll save a few dollars.,If you already have the 1st gen, then it’s probably not worth the upgrade.  If you are looking to buy your first pair of AirPods, then go for these.

  These AirPods are amazing they automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.,Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time.,I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy

  So I've been using this charger for a few weeks now and here are some of my thoughts:,1. Sturdy,2. Easy to understand,3. AMAZING design,4. And a decent battery life.,While it doesn't have quick charge, it does its job well if you are in no rush for battery. Im glad it came out sturdy, i'm quite clumsy so its REALLY great that it can survive being dropped. The interface is really easy to understand  and the flashlight is just a nice touch. As for the design I couldn't have asked for more, it has a nice rigid grip on the back which for me is really satisfying along with the paw indicator which looks really good. All in all i was satisfied with this product and it would do well for a lot of people.

   Portable charger is bit heavier than iPhone XS but slim. Both the USB outlets works great and capacity is huge. I can charge two phones at the same time or one phone and one USB light that comes in the package. It came with a decent quality pouch.

We are hoping to buy additional units for our iPads and have HIGHLY recommended this power bank to our entire rescue team as well as many others who find themselves low on power.

  Pretty disappointed. It hasn't even been 6 months, and one of the ports don't charge anymore. TBH, after doing some review reading, I was excited about this charger.  I bought one for myself and one for my friend. I'm not sure how his is doing or how often he uses it (I don't think that should matter regarding the ports, I can understand if the battery dies over time....hopefully not a short amount of time).  I usually use it over the weekends, and took it on another weekend trip to find my self short a charging port. Definitely annoyed!,EDIT 11/08/16: I was contacted by their customer service team the following day after writing this review. Their team was very pleasant to deal with and quick with their responses. Within a day or two, they've already sent out a replacement for the faulty PowerCore 20100 I purchased a couple of months ago! If all goes well, I'll be updating this review again! Great customer service from Anker!,EDiT 2/16/17: Anker's customer service is second to none! The replacement works as it should, but the wire would not charge the PowerCore.  After contacting their customer service team again, they were happy to replace the faulty wire sent with the replacement PowerCore. Great company that cares about their customers. I just wish products nowadays lasted longer, but regardless, I'll be buying their products again.

  After fully charging the Anker PowerCore 20100, I ended up running my own personal test to see just how many full charges I could get on my Samsung Galaxy S7.,Everyday, for 5 days in a row, I would allow my phone to drain as much as possible as you can see below....then the next morning I would charge my phone using only the Anker Powerbank until it was fully charged.,Here are the results!,*Charge #1 = 15% to 100% power in 1 hour 35 mins. (4 solid lights),*Charge #2 = 20% to 100% power in 1 hour 30 mins. (3 solid lights),*Charge #3 = 08% to 100% power in 1 hour 45 mins. (2 solid lights),*Charge #4 = 03% to 100% power in 1 hour 50 mins. (1 solid light),*Charge #5 = 20% to 100% power in 1 hour 25 mins. (1 Blinking light),The next morning (on day 6), I tried recharging the phone again while the 1 remaining light on the Anker Power bank was still blinking .....,It basically went from 14% to 21% power before the Power bank ended up running completely dry.,So all in all I was able to get ""5 Full Charges"" from this one Power Bank with my Samsung Galaxy S7.,Hope this helps anyone who is undecided on pulling the trigger!

  Here is a story of the amazing customer service of this Anker bunch!,I bought this unit in March of 2017. I have not used it too may times. But, occasionally I have charged Iphone, Ipad, and some portable speakers. It would basically charge all of them with a single charge to the PowerCore. Very nice!,In May of 2018, I noted that when charging, the unit would get to the point where the last LED was blinking, but the lights would never turn off. Other than this, the ability to charge other devices seemed to be unchanged. However, this charging behavior made me wonder whether this was an indication of a potential failure beginning. Therefore I contacted Anker since I was still in their 18 month warranty period (just).,I have to say that working with them has been nothing but a pleasure! They responded to me the same day via email. Asked for a few other troubleshooting steps, and then sent me a new one after the extra steps did not resolve the issue. And......they  let me keep the initial PowerCore which of course still works (for the time being)! Amazing.,I am extremely pleased with this company and will continue to do business with them. Highly recommended.

  Loved this powerbank when I initially received it (ordered in Feb 2018) and it has only been a few months and a USB port has already stopped working. I tried to use different charging cables, thinking it was the cable that was faulty but cables work with wall charger, just not the portable charger. Disappointed because this product had wonderful reviews and I really liked the high charging capacity and the small sleek design. Previously I owned portable charges with similar charging capacity but they were much more bulky. I guess my search for a great portable charger continues.

  We purchased two or three of these and for several months they worked really well. However now we cannot charge them at all. Hopefully someone from Anker reads this review.,Update: Following this review I was contacted by Anker and they sent out two replacement batteries. The batteries worked well for 10 months then wouldn’t charge and we did in fact recharge with an Anker multi charging port (works great no problems) and Anker cable. Maybe these backup batteries only last a bit less than a year or so, though that’s not what I expect as a consumer. Otherwise, Anker puts sells solid speakers we own, among other Anker products. This is why I’m so disappointing about these backup chargers.

  After 5 months. It doesn't even charge my phone anymore it just keeps it at its current battery life. stopped charging my girlfriends iphone completely. and doesn't work on other micro SD products such as my portable speaker anymore.,*** UPDATE ***,Anker did send me a replacement free of charge been using it for a week and have had no issues and works even better than the first one I had right out of the box. If I do not update this again then the product has lasted and does the job great.  If this one also goes bad after a couple of months I will update.  ~ week 2

  At the time of buying this I wanted to get a power bank as my current phone had a battery discharge problem and I was thinking I could extend its life by having a portable charger. I was looking around on amazon and found this. It had quite a few reviews and I have purchased anker products in the past and am usually pretty happy with it. I went ahead and decided to buy this.,It arrived quickly and the product box looked really nice. I opened it up and noticed that the portable charger was a bit bigger than what I anticipated. Inside the box was the portable charger, a usb cable, a carrying case for the portable charger, the warranty info and the manual. I immediately noticed the high quality of the charger. It feels solid in your hands and a bit heavier than I was expecting as well. There are some portable chargers that have extra stuff like a flashlight but this charger just sticks to the basic. There are two USB Ports where you can plug in your usb cable and then connect that to your device. Also, there is one micro usb port for charging the portable charger itself. Lastly, there are 4 LEDs on one side of the charger. These 4 LEDs represent how much juice is left in the portable charger. 4 LEDs means its at 100%. 3 LEDs mean 75% and so on. There is a button on the side of the charger as well. This button lights up the LEDs for you to know how much capacity is left. Anker uses their own technology to speed up the charging which is awesome. I did notice the devices I plugged in took  The fact that you can charge two devices at the same time is pretty convenient as well. I have done this a few times and it works quite well.,There are a few reasons I took a star off. One of them is that charging the actual portable charger to its full capacity takes around 8 hours which is quite long. I understand the capacity is quite big but a power adapter for the charger itself could have been included. The other two reasons are weight and size. The weight and size are a little bit annoying to me as when I think of portable chargers I think of something you can put in your pocket and charge your phone at the same time. With the weight and size of this it is a bit difficult to do something specific like that. This is not a huge issue but it is just something I thought could be worth mentioning. I am aware now that anker and other companies offer smaller sized power banks. Overall, I am pretty happy with this purchase. I bought this last year and still can't notice any decrease in quality.

  2 stars for the product, 5 stars for the customer service.,My first Anker 20100 Portable Charger died after 1 year - granted, I use it extremely often as I am a Pokemon Go player, so I was happy with the product.  At that time, I did not realize there was a warranty, so I purchased a second one (same model, different colour) as a replacement.  This Anker 20100 only lasted a few months before it died.  Both chargers had the same symptoms: The charger is charged (2-4 lights on), when I plug it in it charges the phone for only a few seconds and then the charger turns off. I contacted Anker support and they were amazing, with few questions asked they sent two replacements within days.  I was happily an Anker customer and ready to give a 5 star review because they stand by their products and I was hoping all would be well with the replacements.  On day 1, one of the replacements had the exact same issue so it is unusable. I reached out this morning to see if there is a different product I can get instead because 3 portable chargers with the same problem is definitely a pattern of a larger issue.  Overall: I would suggest purchasing an Anker product because of their great customer service, but I would not recommend this particular portable charger because I had 3 stop working within a year and a half.

  When I first received it, it wasn't half full and it did take a long time to charge. So I decided to upgrade to the 26800+ that came with the Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and Powerport. Anker reached out to me and assisted me with the issue that I was having. This is still a great product. If you wish to buy this model, I also recommend that you buy the Anker Powerport...Will make life easier.,Thanks to Anker, their exceptionally excellent customer service, and their client appreciation...I am a very happy customer. Great products, excellent quality, and excellent service. I highly recommend any Anker product, as Anker does stand behind their products and quality.

  I bought this in early August of 2017, and have used it pretty consistently for the past 6 months. Great product! Very satisfied and I feel like I don't need to get in to all the details like in other reviews. I've gone through 3 full charges of my iPhone 8 Plus, and it charges even faster than when I plug to the wall. Once the battery is fully drained, then I'll recharge it again before I go to bed and 7-8 hours later it is ready to go!,It is heavy but I don't mind it! I got used to it for my frequent travels. I will be looking in to the newer, smaller portable battery though!
