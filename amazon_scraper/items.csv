So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.If you are still reading - here are the good sides (why I purchased this in spite of what I wrote above)A Mac is a Mac is a Mac. So is this one. The hardware are perfectly matched and performance is always optimal. This laptop is for carrying along as a second laptop, alongside my official one, a DELL workhorse. MAcbook Air is lightweight and can run other operating systems. I use this to run Windows and Linux.The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to ""buy"" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.Now coming back to my rating... I run mostly Windows and Linux on this MAC. Happy with it because the hardware is great. I consider myself a power user - so I know that I can find alternatives for this if and when Apple pulls the plug of support (should be available for at least another year, and a certain period after that as Apple's support to ""obsolete"" devices). Hence a durability rating of 3 stars only !!That (above) is the truth laid bare. Please decide and buy at your own risk.~~ Buy this if you like the hardware (but know that DELL or HP would give a much better hardware at this price, and those will be upgradable and last much longer than this)~~ Buy this because you understand that this hardware is very stable and Mac OS can protect your windows as it works in the MAC Shell. Buy this because you can run Linux once Mac makes this obsolete.~~ Do not buy this if you feel it adds to your premium value. It will be a dinosaur soon and you will be left stranded. Think of the plight of iPhone 5, which was premium 24 months ago. People rushed and purchased their ""cheap iPhone"" around a year back.

The power button started giving problems in end-May 2019. The computer just would not startup. I scanned the Net for such problems.  A lot of work arounds: push the Start button+ shift button etc. This worked for a few days. Then such work around too stopped working at all - the computed refused to start-up once shut down. Surprisingly, I ran the computer diagnostics on the Macbook, and the diagnostics program could not find any defect! I was surprised that even if the program could not find a defect on the computer, yet the computer once shut down would not start up.Secondly, finding a  Macbook authorised service center too is an onerous task in India. The Service center informed me that there is a problem with the mother board. And it needs to be replaced. Wow!

Prabhat Rayal,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPABNKQRFNGC5FY6GCPKIF3YIMQ,Reviewed in India on 19 May 2019,0,0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for 52K during Amazon Sale. I can say that this is the best budget friendly Macbook ever.I have been a windows user for a very long time and always wanted to try a Mac because the whole world uses it. I used to be an Apple critic. But after using it for months, I can say that I am never going back to Windows again.The only thing Windows does better is gaming. Buy a Windows if you care about gaming. For everything else, Mac should be your preference. If you are looking forward to developing iOS or Mac apps, Mac is the only way.It is much more faster, responsive and sturdy than my Windows laptop. The OS never crashes and the performance is just flawless. Meanwhile my Windows laptop crashes very often ( Blue screen of death, Unwanted updates, driver incompatibility etc). I receive free OS updates every now and then and there has never been a compatibility issue.Apple - You just earned a new customer for life. Just make sure you don’t keep increasing the prices as it is the only con I can think of.TL;DR - If you want a laptop that is not going to irritate you every now and then and your budget is 50-60K. Wait for the sale and go for this Mac. But remember - This is not for gaming. For that, buy windows",The Best Budget Friendly Macbook,Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is still not enough to edit 4k60fps videos! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved!

It was a great feeling when I purchased this laptop and it was a big ambition too... Why it can't be? People were looking at me with a great look when I carry this Mac along with me to office or to public places. It was again a great experience of speed, look, weight, logo, and u name anything u want, u have it...However, after 3 years, the problem suddenly came up. My Keypad and Mouse tracker both failed working and the reason was not known. I tried with customer care too to find a solution, however after spending an hr, I found no solution. Finally the CC suggested me to take it to Service centre. The CC person informed me that they will do resetting the mac but all in vain. For that they charged Rs.1800/-Then after 2 days they told that keypad need to be replaced which will cost Rs.25000/- then again for the Trackpad which will be around Rs.10000/-So totally it is Rs.35000/- (approx)Now the people whoever are reading this review, need to calculate there financial issues and then plan to go ahead. Moreover, I felt it is not so user friendly laptop and it has many restrictions. Eg-Connect Android Mobile to Mac...The cost of Display will be Rs. 49000/-..

After 2 years of good usage, its working same as when I bought it (processor basically). LOVE the trackpad and the keys!Things that changed after 2 years are that it starts heating up near the charging point (even when I'm not charging and simply using it) sometimes (3/10 times). I searched and found out it happens due to dirt particles going inside and can be resolved by going to a store and ask them to fix or buy a set of screwdriver for this mac and clean it up yourself.Another problem is the adapter, now after 2 years it had started heating up A LOT (7/10 times). Sometimes you can't even touch it for more than 5 seconds, it gets that hot. So for that what I do is use charger with its extension, put the adapter on the floor to transfer the heat (lol). It works most of the times for me, sometimes it doesn't and I have to take the magsafe connector off the laptop every few minutes (if I'm using the laptop) .The MagSafe connector also gets very hot while charging but cools down in literally 4-5 seconds after disconnecting.Third problem I saw is with Charging wire (from near the MagSafe connector), it's started to turn yellow due to heat probably. I put of a cable protector 2 months ago and saw this 'development' happening after that only mostly.  I took that protector off now.Overall it's a very good machine.  My friend who has the same model replaced the battery after 3+ years usage and now his laptop is working perfectly fine. He doesn't face heating problems much as I do. So maybe my laptop got some defects.I haven't tried other laptops in this range except Lenovo Yoga which was BS. I remember struggling to find internet and bluetooth connectivity in windows laptop, in Mac everything is so smooth. It doesn't hang at all! And yes not to forget, it's lightweight!!

But somehow it made sense over the time. I am writing this review after 1 year of usage. I bought the Mac Air (2017 version) on Jan 2019 for around 61K.Experience:About 121 GB will be available for your usage. System is super speed and responsive. Absolutely seamless performance. Display is a beauty. I know some would complain about its viewing angle, but when you start to use it, no one will care about such technical details. Its the most lightest and slimmest machine, don't worry weight. The best part is, Battery Backup. Its so long that you'll even forget when was it last charged. Even on straight usage, minimum 8 hours is guaranteed. I think its more than that.If you are a software developer, trust me, it will perform way more than any other i5+8GB machine, plus you get the Linux flavor.But.......1) Don't buy if you are gamer. Please don't buy. This is not meant for that.2) Don't buy if you are a big fan of windows and use too many 'unpopular' software. Although Mac OS will support all enterprise level and popular software, you will not find software for every crappy thing.3) If you are a careless user of laptop, like smashing keyboard and dropping laptop kinda guy/girl. Mac is somewhat sensitive and cannot withstand your strong emotional outbursts.4) Don't buy if you need a dedicated Graphics card or high performance systems.

I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.Thanks for reading!

However the recent incident with my Mac Air that I brought through Amazon last October changes the perception towards Apple took a deep dent.Few months ago I had some issue with my MacAir screen, there was no accidental fall or mishandling on my part, which is quite evident as there are no physical damage not even a scratch which says that there was any mishandling on my part.At the time it was still under warranty period, So I took it to one of the Authorized apple store nearby, At the service centre the technician just by looking at the screen told me that it won’t be covered under warranty and I’ve to pay  Rs. 43,000/- towards replacement, which came as a shock to me as, first there was no fault of my own, and secondly the whole thing cost me Rs. 54,000/- so I don’t know how Apple justify such unfair pricing. Thereafter, shocked and helpless I follow up with Apple Support repeated calls and chatting but all in vain, but apparently I found out that there is nothing on their hand, whatever the Authorized Apple Service center says is the final. I was told it is pressure damage, which won’t be covered under warranty and will cost me as much the cost of Original Machine. I was unaware and shock to find that Organization like Apple will indulge in such fraudulent and unfair trade practice for unfair monetary gain.When I look for more information online it came to my knowledge that this is not an uncommon thing with MacAir, it so fragile that MacAir is prone to pressure damage, a designing and manufacturing flaw, and there are many users who has suffered the same, and Apple has refused to address.Currently my Mac is unusable and just like that without any fault of my own my entire saving of Rs 54,000/- gone to waste. There is no question of repairing at an unjustified cost when few thousands more will get me a new one and there are better options avalible other than Mac .Pro: Atheistic, premium feelingCons: Shocking replacement cost,  Poor Post sale Support, Fragile and prone to screen damage",Prone to screen damage,Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

They took 3 weeks to repair it. They repaired screen but battery life came to 3-4 hours which earlier was 10-11 hours and the usage was same. Also the fan sometimes automatically started running very fast and automatically stopped. Even switching ON after shut down, the fan started to run fast.When I brought back after repair, the charger got damaged after 4 days and I took MacBook as well as charger for repair. They exchanged the charger with the new one which doesn't look like Apple original, as when I plug in the charger, I get small amount of current over my MacBook.And they inspected MacBook and did something and said that Fan issue has been solved.After 1 week I'm still getting same Fan issues and the battery life has literally fallen a lot as compared to before the repair.So there is one year warranty for this, and I spent 3 months of it only in repair. And the problems started arising after 1st screen repair.It seems they knowingly put these so that you have to buy 2 year extra warranty.Everything started only after when I took my MacBook to repair.",Very bad service,Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the ""Macbook"". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.Thanks for reading!

I barely takes a week to get accustomed to everything.PROS:1. This is the best for daily/work use due to its battery life. It works seamlessly for over 12 to 15hours without plugging in a wall charger2. The laptop is seriously light weight which makes it easy to use on the go3. Gets all new software updates released by apple4. The windows based laptops from the companies mentioned above start ageing but 1.5year mark. Slower speed, diminishing battery life, hardware and software issues. None of the usual crap is seen with a mac. My 2 year old mac has the same functionality like the day of its purchase.5. Good for video editing6. Keyboard is great7. Best mouse tracker overallCONS:1. Apple laptops are expensive so I recommend waiting for sale to purchase one. It is also an investment for next 5 to 6 years for seamless laptop use. Buy only if you are going to get a good use out of it.2. The screen quality of this model( aka older version) is not the best. Newer models have a significantly better display. If you have the money, go for it.3. This is not a gaming laptop. If you are looking for that, this is not for you.Overall impression:I dont think a mac should be purchased to be a status symbol or by brand fanatics.If you are a student or someone who requires a mid range laptop, I would recommend this.For people with bigger pockets, I would recommend the new macbook air. The screen quality is excellent and the laptop is much faster than its contemporaries.",Best mid range laptop,Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful
