I bought a 16 ounce mug in Radiant Orchid, and I don't have one single complaint. Like was mentioned in one review I read, if you follow the clearly written instructions that are included with your mug you should have no problems whatsoever. ""Funny taste""? WASH YOUR MUG LIKE IT SAYS TO DO! Leaking? FILL YOUR MUG AND CLOSE THE LID LIKE IT SAYS TO DO! ""My beverage is hot!"" Well, dummy, YOU put the beverage in there and the mug is designed to keep it hot so what do you flippin' think it gonna happen?I love that it is autoseal because I am often walking into work with an armload of stuff and now I don't have to be concerned with keeping my mug upright while I fumble with other things. There is also no longer a rush to chug my coffee before it gets cold! I'm currently sipping on hot coffee that was poured at 7am this morning. It is now 9:52am.Mug praises aside I come to you with a sincere warning to pay close attention to the source of the mug you choose.MY mug was distributed by Amazon so I had no problems whatsoever. However, I also purchased a mug for my husband at the same time through a third party that is long overdue to arrive, and I can't get a reply to my e-mails.","Love the mug, but make sure it ships through Amazon!",Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 16 OunceColor: Radiant OrchidVerified Purchase,107 people found this helpful,,945,222,Public,24262

I put my hot beverage of choice inside the thermos by 5:40am (what am I doing up so early?) And at around noon it is still nice and warm (not piping hot, but definitely not cold or even tepid) so that's give or take 6hrs. I have repeated this exact ritual nearly every day and it will always be deliciously warm at noon time. By the by, when I pour my beverage into the thermos it is piping hot, meaning if i were to drink it, my tongue would sting, but not really get ""burned"".  My tips/warnings:  - If you get one of the colored ones the paint WILL come off if you wash it in the DISHWASHER. I know some people were complaining about that, but in the safety manual it clearly states that only the unpainted stainless steel bottles are dishwasher safe.  - Wash it the way it shows you on the safety manual for optimal cleanliness.  - Rinse it right before every use. One time, there was some soap residue left over in my  lid and I ended up with gross soapy tea, so unless you're into that just run the lid under warm water.  - DON'T tilt the lid and THEN press the button to open the sippy cup or you'll get a face full of hot liquid. In other words, press the button while the thermos is vertical then tilt it to take a sip. This may seem stupid, but I had no warning (maybe I'm just an idiot) and now no one else has to look like a complete goof if it happens in a public setting.That's it for now, if anything else comes up I'll be sure to inform you guys.",Tips and overall Review.,Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 20 OunceColor: Stainless SteelVerified Purchase,"3,057 people found this helpful",,526,41,Public,797022

We’ve had it a few months and despite regular cleaning, it DOES stink, no matter what I do. Vinegar, dish soap, baking soda, cleaning with a tiny wire brush, nothing has fully rid us of the “old creamer, burnt coffee” stench. I’m really bummed...but this may be a 4x per year purchase in order to keep it safe to drink from.[Independent, verified, no compensation received for this review.]Coffee addict’s MUST HAVE! I’ve been through 6 different mugs in six months. They’ve either leaked, broken the flip-tab, were hot to the touch, didn’t clean easily, or just didn’t keep coffee hot longer than 30 minutes. This mug does all of those things and I couldn’t be happier, because I was ready to give up. That list above also includes another Contigo 16 oz. mug...kept things hot but the slider broke after 2 months and it was impossible to clean. But I digress...There was nothing negative to report about the features or performance during the month-long, multiple daily use “testing” phase, so here are the results with which I was most pleased.• Incredibly easy to clean top. Yes! No more waking up after hand washing the night before, ready to pop the top on, only to realize there’s a colony of mold setting up shop right where my mouth will be. The stopper piece that detaches for cleaning also comes of very easily and snaps back into place with no effort. You can put the lid on top rack of dishwasher but I’ve heard that before and am not willing to risk it.• Truly one-handed operation. No having to balance the steering wheel on your knees while you lift with your right, pop lid with left, and try to sip-flip-replace while trying not to spill and focus on the road.• No-spill claims are actually TRUE this time!• Stylish, modern appearance.• Heavy-duty without looking or feeling like it.• Description claims the 20 oz size keeps hot for 7 hours, but I have the 16 and after six hours the contents were about half as hot as when made (78 degree room). Pretty impressive.In short, buy this mug. Don’t spend $80 on a fancy thing when this sleek silver mug will do the job just as well if not better!Please let me know if this was helpful, thank you!",Updated...—-Coffee Snob Approved —-,Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 16 OunceColor: Stainless SteelVerified Purchase,437 people found this helpful,,1584,68,Public,77494

I have inspected, cleaned, and retried this cup a few times since then. It seems to work after being dried thoroughly before reuse. But then after the second fill of hot liquid it starts to leak again. I held off writing a negative review and thought I would just never buy again from this company.

The first purchase was based on my satisfaction with a Contigo mug that I won as a door prize at a charity event, and in Jan 2014 I bought the two mugs to replace that one (when I left it in a classroom where I made a presentation - the teacher laughed when I asked if the kids, who know quality when they see it, had by chance returned it to her) - one for my wife and one for me. We used them regularly, and they traveled widely with us, for more than 18 months, but we eventually lost both - at different times.So, in June, I went back to Amazon to replace them.  I'm not sure why, but I couldn't find the same pair I'd bought earlier (they seem to be on the site now), so I ended up ordering this pair.  They were ~$38, compared to the ~$30 I remembered from the earlier purchase, but I figured that was just inflation.(?) Anyway, these came a couple of months ago, and I was surprised that they were quite different from the earlier ones.  The top has a different mechanism, which pops apart for cleaning (not sure, but it seems like an unnecessary improvement, since the previous design worked fine for us) and the overall construction is much lighter weight (thinner walled?).  I was surprised to find that I could fill this apparently thin-walled container with hot coffee and never feel any warmth coming through to the outside!  It obviously has a very thin, but very efficient, vacuum chamber between the inside and outside - impressive engineering!Until yesterday, when the mug I was carrying in a tote with a bunch of papers LEAKED all over the papers. I checked to make sure that the cover was screwed on tight (it was) and that the button hadn't somehow gotten pressed, but found that the mug still leaked a steady drip when inverted. I was dismayed to find that the other one also leaked when sealed as tightly as possible and held upside down.  Though I'd been impressed with the lack of drips from the earlier model, I'm very discouraged with the failure of this new design. It appears that the seal in the new cover design is based on a flimsy flexible plastic gasket that doesn't actually seal very well.  (See attached photo)I was surprised while shopping at our local Costco this evening, to see a pair of Contigo mugs very similar to the earlier design discussed above - for only $19.99!  I bought them and decided to return the other ones to Amazon - especially because of the price difference. The new ones have a different cover seal design, sort of between the original simple design and the flimsy gasket of the new one from Amazon.  I haven't tested them yet, but they look less likely to fail than the more complex ones that did fail.I was disheartened to find that Amazon won't accept return of items like this more than 30 days after delivery, so I'm stuck with them.  I apologize for the length of this review, but it's the best way I can see to protest Amazon's product selection, pricing and return policies.","Great vacuum insulation, Inadequate cover seal!",Verified Purchase,294 people found this helpful,,332,13,Public,1846667

The company website was impressive with the variety of colors, styles and customer reviews, and once I read the claim that this mug kept  drinks hot for hours, I was sold.My mug arrived from Amazon, earlier than promised and the packing from Contigo worked perfectly to prevent dents and scrapes to damaged their visibly beautiful mug. As I removed the cover/handle, I was taken back  by the fact that this mug was of single wall construction and made me skeptic of the Contigo claim that their mugs kept liquids hot for hours.The  next morning, I poured my piping hot java in the AUTOSEAL Travel mug and headed on my 1 hr commute. I liked the mug's locking handle feature, but wasn't a fan of the ergonomic design, as I took my first sip after 15 minutes on the road.Just as with my Starbucks mug, I carefully took that first sip, anticipating that I'd burn my mouth but surprising the coffee wasn't piping hot but luke-warm. As I continued my commute, drinking warm coffee out of such a good-looking mug, I realized that the company's claim was a only marketing hype. ""Drinks stay hot for hours on end.""As a last ditch effort to make the AUTOSEAL mug work, the next day I preheated it with hot water. This gave me hotter drink for the first few minutes but it could not resolve the issue of the mug being on single-wall construction. I called the company to complain and they were ready to send out a replacement that same day, as they thought the mug was defective. I thanked them for their customer service efforts but declined after knowing that the mug was not defective, it's a result of the product's overall design.If you're looking for a travel mug that keeps your drinks,  hot or cold for hours, and disappointingly, the Contigo mugs definitely aren't the ones.  I'll continue my search for the ultimate and best travel mugs for me and my wife. In the meantime, I'll go back to using the Starbucks Stainless Steel Travel Mug. My advice to Contigo, is to make your mugs of double-wall construction, tweak the  clumsy handle and you'll have a product that's visibly beautiful and keeps the drinks inside, hot or cold for hours.","Visibly Beautiful, While Performing  Poorly at Keeping Drinks Hot",Style: HandlePattern Name: 1 1 Count (Pack of 1)Color: BlackVerified Purchase,35 people found this helpful,,99,18,Public,1379991

I love the color and sheen! It's been on my wishlist for a while: only wish I'd splurged sooner!I like my oxo good grips too, but this one is better. The oxo has just one seal with a spring-loaded plunger and silicone gasket in the lid that's either open or closed (with that inaccessible internal channel for cleaning). It clicks when you toggle (think resonant ballpoint pen clicking level noisy in a work meeting or Sunday morning sermon). Whereas the contigo has a secondary safety lock that clicks (a light plastic snap) when you toggle it, but even when that's unlocked, you have to actively depress the open/release-to-drink button to dispense the liquid from the mouthpiece (better no spill design) and that active release is silent. I've also had the plunger sheer off of an oxo lid that was knocked off the counter, ruining the whole unit, whereas there doesn't appear to be a similar design vulnerability with the contigo.Update 11/2018 (3 months): 1. The finishing paint is wearing off in a ring around the base especially. Not that big of a deal. 2. Dropped once from three feet and no longer a leak-proof seal between the unit and the lid. Before, I could close and shake to mix my cream and sugar. Now it dribbles coffee especially near the release button if inverted. Kind of a big deal! Not covered under the lifetime warranty as manufacture defect or normal wear/tear. Debating whether it's worth replacing if this vulnerable.

When they work as advertised, they are amazing! They have never leaked and hold temperature for 5-7 hours depending on hot or cold and how quickly I drink my coffee that day. Also, the Autoseal lid is pretty awesome. However, both of them have failed even before one year has elapsed. We always hand washed them after use and they never fell, so it's puzzling how these failures happen.Anyway, one stopped insulating on Feb 6th 2017, bringing the coffee to room temperature in 2 hours or so. I immediately contacted Contigo, and as others have mentioned, I received an automatic message saying that I would be contacted within 2-3 weeks, which felt quite long dealing with room temperature coffee. I heard back on Feb 22nd and after a fairly quick correspondence, they shipped out a replacement on Feb 23rd (it took an additional week for it to arrive) and told me to just discard the faulty one. I kept the lid since it was fine, and replaced the mug.Fast forward to Sept 2017, the other mug exhibited the same symptoms and stopped insulating. I contacted Contigo on Sept 13th and again I received the same automatic message. Today is Oct 3rd and I still have not heard from Contigo. What's more, when I was handwashing this faulty mug today, the bottom piece of the mug spontaneously popped out. As some other reviewers have mentioned, it's impossible to put this piece back into its place and now sharp edges are exposed making this mug entirely useless.I give high marks on this mug for being leakproof and having a convenient lid design. However, I cannot recommend this product because it will fail to insulate within a year.

People complained about how they would have hot drinks splash or spray on them when the depress the button to drink.  Well, if you depress the button to relieve pressure when the cup is away from your face you don't have to deal with that problem.  Another complaint from people was how the paint was peeling and chipping after they put their mug in the dishwasher.

I hope that I still have my strength/won't get arthritis anytime soon otherwise holding the the button would suck2) Colors -> Since I just recently got this the black color hasn't faded.

Yes, a little OCD, but they have earned my compulsive loyalty to accompany my caffeine addiction.PROS:1) IT DOES NOT LEAK. I can confidently throw this into my purse or gym bag upside down or sideways, and there will not be even a drop that comes out. (Sure, if you're determine to make if fail, you can. Screw the top on properly, okay? It's an amazing feat of engineering--not magic.)2) It's easy to drink from. Just press in the handy button on the cap, which is solid (to keep it leak-proof), but doesn't require a lot of pressure. I don't have arthritis, but I would guess that it would be accessible even for someone who does. And the way the button is positioned, it's natural to how you hold the mug. You don't have to unscrew any lids or unsnap a flip top.3) It keeps drinks hot. I use mine for hot coffee, so I can't comment on how well it does for cold drinks. I'm not sure that it lives up to the 7-hour claim, but it keeps it hot for probably 4 hours, and reasonably warm for a number hours after that.4) It holds 20 ounces. I love the   Zojirushi SM-KHE48AG Stainless Steel Mug, 16-Ounce, Smoky Blue           and all things Zojirush--but it's only 16 ounces. If you're like me and--if you're without your own mug--order your coffee by ""whatever size you have that's closest to 5 gallons"", that extra 4 ounces is a bigger deal than just 4 ounces. I do see however that Zojirushi now has a 20 ounce   Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA Stainless Steel Mug, 20-Ounce, Black           so I'll be checking that out--but note that it's 50% more expensive.5) Dishwasher safe. I do not have time for the prima donna mugs that require hand washing.CONS:Note that I do not consider any of these significant enough to deduct a star.1) While the Contigo stainless travel mug does a serviceable job of keeping hot beverages hot, it falls a little short of Contigo's claims.2) The innards of the lid are not fully accessible for cleaning. I have a few versions of this mug, and the lids on the newer ones are now designed to easily pull out so more of that inner part is exposed when in the dishwasher, and I have never had any problem with anything gunky or science-experiment-like showing up. But the above-referenced Zojirushi does have a better-engineered lid for exposing every part for cleaning. I periodically soak my Contigo lids in a combo of hot water, dish soap & citric acid, and that seems to get any small amounts of coffee gunk out.For the price and what it offers, the Contigo Autoseal stainless travel mug is the best on the market.

The first one leaked all over.  This one, although doesn't seem to leak like the first, still doesn't seal properly or ""line up"".  I've purchased many Contigos before, for my fiancé.  It's the only cup he'll use, as he's an electrical engineer and needs to use his hands constantly at work.  Therefore, for sanitary reasons, he likes the  ""autoseal"" cups (there is one other in the Contigo line) Contigo has, as he can drink without touching the top of the cup.  After receiving the first one as a gift for him, I went to use it the first time for his morning coffee he was taking to work.  When I went to give it a last slight ""shake"", as I always do, it ended up leaking ALL over.  This is something that has NEVER happened with his Contigo cups.  I thought I had put the top on incorrectly, but then found I hadn't.  I put in for an exchange, assuming it was a fluke.  The second one however, although doesn't leak like the first, doesn't ""line"" up when closed (the cups seal perfectly when you close them, and line up with the lettering on the cup).  It also still will leave small beads of coffee by the rim that will slowly drip down the cup.My conclusion is, these are either knockoffs (which is a concern if made in China) OR, are line rejects/defects.  Either way, they aren't true Contigo cups, yet are charging the same amount for them as you'd pay in the stores.  So buyer beware!!",**BEWARE** NOT AUTHENTIC!!

It holds a lot of coffee which is nice and it keeps the coffee hot for hours. It has a slim design so it is easy to hold in your hand. The body says hand wash and the lid is dishwasher safe. Kinda stinks, but it is really easy to clean. The lid has a part to push on that opens up the bottom for it to get a good clean. There is a lock button at the top so that it cannot leak and I like that you have to push a button to take a drink. It helps makes spills happen less especially when being taken to and from school. We didn't have any issues with dents and he has been using it a week and it is working great. This lid does screw into the inside of the cup, so you can only fill to the bottom of the screw part or else it will make a mess when you put the lid on. Not a big deal for us because it is a lot of coffee in there already, but my dad got a cup like that after having one that screwed on the outside so you could fill to the brim if you wanted so I figured I should mention it to anyone that might bother.

I no longer have to fumble to open and close a snap on/off thing, or screw cap on top. Everything this product says it will do. it does. With a couple exceptions.It CAN leak, and hear's how. I noticed that after every sip (in my case, coffee), if I release the front AutoSeal button too soon before removing the mug from my lips, there often remains a small pool of coffee sitting inside the mouthpiece which, if knocked over, will spill out (see photo). I could release the liquid by pressing the AutoSeal button again, but that's awkward. After a few tests, I've simply adjusted my grip so that the AutoSeal button remains pressed, i.e the mouthpiece remains open until I am finished sipping, thus eliminating any pool of liquid forming. Kind of like bleeding an old-fashioned radiator (if you're as old as me!).The max timeframe my 192 degree coffee remained reasonably hot was 3.5 hours, not up to 7 hours as described.Read the use and cleaning instructions; they are very helpful in avoiding having the pressurized liquid inside splashing the drinker by pressing the AutoSeal button too close to one's face.  Apparently, this mug does create a terrific seal.By the way, I received a unit that had a small dent on the bottom, possibly due to being packed too loosely in the box.

I poured hot, fresh coffee (immediately after it was brewed) into this thing at 7:20am but it was practically ice coffee by the time 11:30am rolled around. The quick dissipation of heat occurred while I was strictly using the autoseal opening to take sips while working in an office setting. The lid wasn't removed until the mug was washed after I returned home in the evening. My best guess is that the mug only kept my coffee warm for maybe 3 hours before it became tepid.I imagine the 7-hour maximum heat retention period must only apply if a liquid is at a roaring boil when it is poured in.","Nice, But...",Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 20 OunceColor: Matte BlackVerified Purchase,,,446,215,Public,18077

I had been using the 16 oz with no issues for about a decade before I discovered the 20 oz. I use it almost every day and it beats every other travel mug I have tried in terms of keeping drinks hot or usability. It keeps beverages hot or warm for hours, doesn't drip, leak or spill, holds a lot and fits perfectly in my hand and car's cup holder. I drink very strong coffee and green or black tea on a regular basis. Would it be challenging to get the screw top lid as clean as it the day I got it because of all the little nooks and crannies and mechanics of the little spring lever? Of course. If that is your goal you should probably look somewhere else. I also have ceramic coffee cups that seem permanently stained from my strongly brewed beverages. It doesn’t bother me. I scrub it with a bottle brush and a toothbrush and soak it in near boiling hot liquids, i.e. coffee and tea, on a regular basis. It's been with me for thousands of miles of driving, hundreds of miles of walking, weeks of camping. It's survived many knock-overs and drops on the ground or floor. I just bought a new one on Amazon today at about twice the price of the last.

The cup will absorb any and all chemicals and retain the scent and flavor of the chemical. It did it from the beginning, but it has progressively gotten worse. I have tried every method to wash the cup but the type of plastic used in this cup retains the chemicals. So the coffee never is a good cup. It retains the oils from the old coffee, or any additives you put into the coffee (bullet proof coffee as a prime example). And if you wash with soap of any kind, the cup is absolutely ruined... Bleach, the same, vinegar, the same, HOT water... no change. Granted the cup really isn't that much of an expense, but to be unable to use the cup at all after washing... that's not acceptable, especially since every other travel coffee mug I have ever purchased has never had this issue. I typically only use vinegar to clean my coffee items, and out of every apparatus I own, this is the only one that vinegar flavor is retained and you can continue to taste the vinegar in every cup. No matter how many times you wash it with just hot water. I have even let coffee soak in it over night to hope it will draw out all the other chemicals retained by the cup, but no luck. I am in search of a new travel mug, but a Contigo product it will not be.I'm a home roasting coffee drinker so I'm an above average coffee consumer in terms of being picky and use the Contigo EVERY day. That being said, the Contigo has exceeded my expectations by far. It truly does not leak. It rattles around in my cooler and I'm comfortable enough keeping in cooler with papers. My only negative is the plastics used inside do tend to get the oils from the coffee built up pretty good so it does need a good scrubbing. Since the plastics also do the same for cleaning products, don't use anything to clean other than a scrub brush and hot water.","Was a great product, but then... *UPDATE 12/28/2018*",Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 16 OunceColor: Latte Trans MatteVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,,187,125,Public,86615916

I ordered them because they had over 78,000 reviews. That makes me on of the morons of the world that's just following the masses. I've never written a review after using something one time but this product warrants just that.First impression, this cup is really light. I have a few light, insulated mugs but they're my cheap, rarely used mugs. They stay in the cupboard for side uses, like tea since nothing but coffee is allowed in my daily mug. But maybe Contigo figured something out and it's still a good mug, so move on. Next thing I noticed is that it's impossible to drink out of this mug without burning yourself. The pour opening is on the outside edge of the lid meaning you can't sip the coffee, you pour it directly into your mouth. If you like hot coffee, this does not work. All my previous, quality mugs had a lip around the lid. This lip allows you to tilt the mug up, releasing the coffee into that cap, then you sip it from the cap. In a quick, 10 minute search of Amazon coffee mugs with this feature in mind, I can't find another mug with this major flaw. Infact while typing this, I brought my new Contigo mug back to the kitchen and poured the coffee into my old mug so I could drink it.Second issue, My last two mugs were excellent in thermal properties. I used to take my coffee with me to Viking games. We'd leave the house around 9:00 in the morning and drive downtown. It's Minnesota so translated, that means COLD winters. We'd hop out of the truck and go grab breakfast at Keys or somewhere and then walk to the dome. My coffee would sit in a truck, at potentially sub zero temperatures, for upwards of 7 hours. When we'd return to the truck I was always amazed because, though my coffee wasn't piping hot, it was still drinkable. This mug on the other hand went with me to a project I'm doing in a downtown condo yesterday. Climate controlled, t-shirt environment. My coffee was cold and undrinkable by maybe 1:00. Might as well put it in a paper cup and saved the $30 for something useful.This is my only experience with Contigo so I won't right them off as a company but this mug is a complete failure.Sidenote: it looks pretty.

I’ve never once had a spill with this cup. I take it to work everyday in my bag, the same bag I carry a computer and a iPad and papers etc within. That’s how confident I am. I am sure to always lock the button before I leave for work. I drive 40 mins both ways commute, but it’s usually empty on the drive home. I’ve kept coffee in it for 3 hours before taking a drink and still manage to burn my lips, just a little bit but not scald, it’s the good kind of burn from coffee, the kind that wakes you up a bit and gives that kick but doesn’t hurt. Basically it keeps it at the perfect amount of hotness for coffee.Pros: lightweight, easy to carry and store in a bag. The lock prevents inadvertent leaks when in a bag. Holds warmth to an excellent degree. Interchangeable lids, you can use the same lid for different coffee cup sizes of the same brand. 16,20,22, 24 oz coffee cups of this brand all share the same style lid so I never have to guess. We have 3 of these cups, so we also have 3 lids. Dishwasher safe! Holy cow this is a big one! Top shelf only folks, keep that plastic safe from the dishwasher heater. Easy to hand wash mostly, except for very inner part of lid, not a big deal as the mechanism folds out of the way to wash the important parts.Cons: not many, I guess one con is it’s only top shelf rated for dishwasher..that’s kind of not a hard thing since I have 2 dishwasher shelves. The only real con, which is a super nit-noid dumb con is that because of this cups excellent sealing properties, when it is empty slight changes in pressure can cause the opening gasket to make weird noises. Like a kind of hissing noise because the air is trying to stabilize due to pressure changes in the atmosphere. It’s a dumb con but honestly it’s the only one I can think of.Definitely would buy and will buy again in the future. No more worries about coffee spills or stains getting in or out of the car or at work or when walking while holding the cup. 5 stars!

You basically have to put your whole mouth around the opening and seal with your lips, after which point you must learn the skill of slurping up the last few drops as you remove your lips. On top of that, you have to tilt the mug much higher than normal mugs to get the liquid to flow and basically dump it into your mouth.

I'm always out of the house all day, so when I'm done with my coffee I just rinse the mug out in a bathroom sink somewhere making sure to rinse water through the lid (the hardest part to clean). Then, at the end of the day I have some little dish brushes (mine are OXO and awesome) and use those to clean the cap with soapy water. This keeps the lid from getting gross. the little silicone lip spout can be popped off to clean between the plastic and the silicone piece to make sure there's not milk debris and bacteria trapped in between, but I usually only do this every couple of days because the rinsing helps keep anything from getting stuck.

The SnapSeal has one component under the lid that rinses off without the trouble.The bottom of this mug is also very square and does not sit in my car cupholder- the kind that has a smaller ring toward the bottom and a larger ring on top. The SnapSeal version is more tapered and will sit in the cupholder securely.I am in hotels a lot and this mug will not fit under the very popular hotel-version Keurigs, but it DOES fit under normal Keurig machines.This mug will not get clean without the use of a bottle-brush. It seems to hang on to a film if you just try to wipe it out with a cloth or a sponge. It also can not be put back together or even have the lid just resting on the top when stored in a cupboard.

I bought 2 of these, one for hot beverages and one for cold. They aren’t leak proof at all!I am constantly getting hot coffee sprayed all over me when I try to swirl the coffee in the cup. The other day I put the cup across my lap and someone called my name and pointed at the cup, which was leaking from the mouth hole, even though it was locked, and down my leg and wheelchair. My favorite hoodie is practically ruined because it has coffee spray all over it. Don’t tip the cup too far, i.e. more than level with your mouth, otherwise you will get a face full of coffee from the lock button, especially if your nose touches the button while you drink. Be careful with putting ice in your cold drinks in the 24oz cup, small pieces of ice get caught in the mouth piece, like in the picture, and the cup won’t fully seal and you will get sprayed. Sometimes you’ll be able to get the ice out by blowing it out, other times you will have to wait until it pops it up your nose.On another note with leaking, with the cup I use for iced tea (which does stain the inside of the lid), I have noticed that if I leave it sitting, overnight for instance, it leaks where the button is and dries there to make a sticky mess on the outside of the cup and whatever it’s sitting on. It doesn’t matter how much liquid is actually in the cup, it could be full or only a few sips left, and it still leaks. That is what the other picture is showing. I have tried everything so prevent this but it still does it anyway. And with the larger version, make sure after you take a drink, that you close the mouthpiece, and then take another sip because your beverage will get caught on the rubber mouthpiece.It doesn’t keep your drinks hot or cold for very long. Hot, maybe an hour or 2 if you’re lucky, and by hot I don’t mean hot, I mean warm at best. Cold drinks it does a little better and you might have small pieces of ice at the 4 hour mark depending on how much you put in the cup to begin with. I’ve noticed that it’s losing the heat/cold from the lid and on the cup where the lid meets the cup. Could be a design flaw for just this specific model because I haven’t noticed it in the smaller cups but I don’t use those as much.Also, when the cups first arrived, one was in perfect condition, the other had a scratch on the inside bottom where the sides of the cup meet the bottom. I don’t know if this is an Amazon issue (like maybe they sent me someone’s return) or if it’s a manufacturing defect, but getting one in perfect condition is a pain. I also bought another set that had the same kind of scratch and was rusted a little at that same seal. So it’s kind of better to go to the stores and buying these, otherwise be prepared to return.The buttons are surprisingly easy to push. But for someone with arthritis, the lock button may be a little hard sometimes. The lid isn’t hard to push down and twist as they suggest, but it is easier if the grooves on either the lid of cup are a little wet, but then you have to worry about your contents leaking.If you still decide to order this cup after all the issues I’ve told you about I wish you luck.",Don’t bother with the 24oz. cups,Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 24 OunceColor: Stainless SteelVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,,11,19,Public,6603858

I’ve been looking for something like this for ages and so glad I finally have a bottle that won’t spill on everything I love! It has two settings. You can have it on the normal one where you hit a button in the back to drink. But you can also lock it, so that even if you hit the drink button, the hole won’t open. This allows you to chuck it in your bag without any fear of spilling.The main downside of this product is the misleading insulation! There is almost no insulation in this product and it is VERY disappointing! This is a well known brand so I did not expect they would lie to customers this intensely. It says hot fluids for 8 hours, cold for 12. Not even close. When I pour fluids in, I automatically feel the temperature on the outside of my container. That shouldn’t happen in an insulated mug.

Kept cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot for a good part of the day. The spill proof lid did a great job of keeping the drink in the cup and not on my table or laptop. The problem I have is with the lid and there were two major complaints. First the plastic part of the lid gets stained by the 3 servings of coffee I had in cup. Wasn't too bad when you drink coffee but when all the other drinks taste like the previous drink, that could be a problem. I don't have this problem with my other travel mug.Second, and biggest issue, is that the threaded portion of the lid separated from the rest of the lid. That rendered it unless, despite trying to put it back together. This happened just from removing and replacing the lid, which really shouldn't happen with the little use the mug had in the past three months. I've used it maybe 2-3 times a month?

When going for a sip of hot coffee or hot whatever, holding the mug upright use the button that opens it for you to drink before it gets to your face. Because hot things pressurize an airtight space and need to burp away from you, not on you, that's why. It will become second nature and in the same way that telling someone not to hit their thumb with a hammer doesn't have nearly the lasting value that actually hitting your thumb with a hammer does, telling you not to open the mug in close proximity to your face will not be nearly as impactful as the event.Lastly, nothing lasts forever. These Contigo contraptions have metal on plastic, they have screw actions, they have internal moving parts that include seals and whatnot. So yeah, not going to last forever.

It does take a bit of effort to press the little button, but that's why this mug is leak proof. I do notice a bit of a metallic taste that I thought might go away after a few uses, but it hasn't.

Don't forget to remove the two seals to clean inside them every once in a while.It's still my everyday coffee mug and haven't seen anything better. There are redesigns that would help prevent mold and enable easier cleaning.POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS- make the underside of the lid smooth and concave like the upper side prevents corners and cavities- making the flap removable allows access to the open hinge area on the under side of the lid, which is incredibly difficult to access with any kind of brush- make the lock knob solid.

But this particular tumbler by Contigo remains the best in existence. I've had several over the years and they've made steady improvements to the lid mechanism so that it's easier to clean. It still has a multitude of nooks and crannies for creamy coffee to hide in, but it's easier than it once was - and there's no denying it's the best closing and easiest to drink from. So it's worth the little extra effort to keep it clean. It keeps the coffee piping hot for about an hour, and sufficiently hot for a couple more. It does even better if it's primed with hot water before adding coffee. It does not leak. Ever. You can hold it upside down, stuff it in a backpack, put it in a roomy pocket - it just won't leak as long as the gasket at the mouth opening remains intact. It's steel construction, so it's nearly indestructible. I cracked a lid once when it rolled off the roof of my car, but short of that, the lid, too, is pretty tough. I've noticed these gradually lose their insulating properties after a couple of years, so I factor that in.I also love that these come in a multitude of colors in gloss and matte.

I never put it in the dishwasher but eventually the blue started to peel off anyway.  Again, it worked just fine so I continued to use it until the push button on the top broke off.  I could still use it, it just hurt to push against a jagged little piece of plastic in order to drink, so now I ordered the stainless and hope it continues to look great for a long time.  Pros:  1. My first two mugs kept my ice water nice and cold all day long.  I don't drink coffee so I can't comment on how long it keeps hot liquids hot.  2. It is absolutely spill-proof!

The first Contigo Autoseal that I got really had a strong chemical smell even after I washed it in the dishwasher multiple times.

After that I knew that I got a defective product and it seems that there are a small percentage of people that have also received a smelly item. If you buy one of these, check it right away for chemical smells in the lid and return it for a different one if it does smell. Don't even try to wash it because if it smells like chemicals, that smell will not go away even after multiple washings.On the good side, this thermos does a really great job of keeping hot liquids hot and cold liquids cold. The top is a really ingenious invention to seal and an pour. With hot liquids, be careful to push the button before tilting the bottle. See other reviews for more info on this issue. I down-rated this from 5 to 4 stars because of the problems that I had with the chemical smell but I'm happy that Amazon customer service resolved the problem right away.

I forgot I wasn't supposed to put it in the dishwasher and the paint came off, which is shown in one of my pictures.Not a dealbreaker, but this cup didn't come in blue so I was stuck getting purple.

This is the one!  It's my 4th try for a travel mug that actually holds 20 oz (yes, a venti) AND does not leak.  First I got a ""20 oz"" MalloMe.  Seemed nicely constructed and came with accessories.  HOWEVER, it barely held 20 oz WITHOUT the lid, and with the lid, maybe it held 18 oz if it was lucky.  So, then I tried a 22 oz Simple Modern.  Very nice looking.  I sprung extra $ for a lid they said didn't leak (I think it should come with it automatically).  Never mind, because I thought the extra 2 oz would leave space for the lid and I'd have my 20 oz.  Unbelievably, I measured the space the lid took and it seems it only held 16 oz!  I hope I made a mistake, but I can promise you, it's not 20.  So, finally I moved to the Contigo.  I'd been concerned about reports of difficulty cleaning the lid, but the newly engineered lid reportedly had resolved that problem.  At first I bought the 24 oz given my previous experience, but then a kind Amazon customer answered my question telling me this lid doesn't take up room in the cup, so I ordered the 20 oz.  Both came today.  I measured and the 20 oz actually does hold 20 oz AND leaves some room to spare!!!  Holy moly, a travel mug that says 20 oz and actually has 20 USEABLE oz!  Then, with the mug/bottle filled with water, I put on the lid, turned the mug sideways and upside down shaking it vigorously and NOT A DROP of water leaked out!  Wow.  A mug that really performs as advertised--at least in term of volume and being leakproof.  Tomorrow I'll see how it keeps my coffee warm, but I'm sure I'll finish drinking it long before it gets cold.  I really wanted this as much to stop dumping cardboard cups into the environment (I was recycling the lids, anyway, but no lids at all is still better).  I'm thrilled.  If anything changes, I'll post an update.  As far as the 24 oz, I'll probably swap it for a 30 oz, because in really hot weather I drink a lot of cold water or tea.","At last, this is THE one!!

I'm on-the-go all the time, and I'm accident-prone, as well. Never in all the years of owning Contigo travel mugs have I ever had a leak. I've throw these in the front passenger seat of the car, in my purse, in large tote bags, etc...I knocked it over in church (gasp!) and had my ""hot beverage"" in the church nursery around young children. I keep it locked at all times in these instances, only unlocking it to take a sip now and then. This keeps my coffee hot all morning. My husband is a guzzler. I'm a sipper. His goal is to down the caffeine. Mine is the ""experience"" of holding and sipping on a warm drink. If  you treasure your hot beverage rituals, and also want to make sure you don't leak or spill, look no further than a Contigo. The models and varieties change over time, but the quality is always very high. The best deals on these, by the way, are usually found at Costco. At my particular location, however, these are seasonal.

This is important for me because I have to walk a while from my car to the building and when it gets to single digits, I really don't want to carry a coffee cup in my hand. It really does not leak in my backpack or purse. It does get a little hot near the top but I welcome that heat!! I have since bought 4 more of these and absolutely love them. I do have some advice though.1. Make sure to buy the newer model so you can disassemble the lid and throw it in the dishwasher. It does not come off completely but enough to get the books and crannies.  Super helpful!2. Be very careful when open it after a journey lol. Mine spewed out hot coffee at and on me- my first day using it. It was hilarious so I am not mad. I just learned how to better prepare for journeys. Which brings me to tip 3.3. Once you have filled the vessel with hot coffee or tea... and put the lid on... before you lock it... push the button as if you were going to take a sip. Completely depressing it as to get out all the pressurized air... then lock it. Ready now! Hopefully no one has to run around their corporate offices in a smelly hoodie from the car because of  coffee vessel mishaps.Bottom line: Huge fan! Totally recommend it!!

Consider this a brief comparison. Both are similarly priced. The Contigo has a nice, firmly-molded handle, whereas the Thermos is a handle-less tumbler. I've been using the Contigo for about 2 weeks now.While both items have a 16-oz capacity, the Thermos actually holds a little more than the Contigo. It also has a heavier feel to it, and in my estimation keeps drinks warmer for a few hours longer. I have had it fall off a motorcycle at low speed (several times) and survive to be used again. I do not think the Contigo would stand up to the same test--leastwise not with that plastic handle!Where the Contigo absolutely shines is the easy-clean auto-seal mechanism. It is sooo much easier to clean than the Thermos ever was with gunk collecting rubber O-ring seals. The drinking holes and overall ambidextrous design of the Contigo lip are also superb, much better than the Thermos!Aside from the lighter weight and the reduced insulation, my only criticism of this mug is that it doesn't seem all that resistant to scratches.

Whether you’re a parent, teacher, or student with a hectic schedule and in need of a caffeine boost, this mug will grant you the power to push through the busy days in life. I will specifically evaluate this product based on its ability to control temperature and prevent spills.Temperature ControlDesigned for convenience and reliability, it will ensure your beverage of choice stays hot or cold for several hours after leaving home. Thanks to the insulated stainless-steel feature, beverages are kept hot for up to 5 hours or cold for up to 12 hours. There’s no need for stopping to microwave a lukewarm drink at the office anymore. This mug’s ability to maintain and control a desired temperature is just one key area of performance.Spill PreventionThis mug features “AUTOSEAL” technology which automatically locks the lid between every sip taken. There are numerous times this feature has saved me from spilling hot coffee on the floor of my car. I remember one day specifically that I was running late to work and the AUTOSEAL feature saved me from spilling hot coffee on myself. Although the mug is not guaranteed to fit in all cupholder sizes of vehicles, it will fit in most standard-sized ones. However, even if the mug doesn’t fit in your desired cupholder, this is a miniscule problem since the AUTOSEAL feature will prevent any leakage of your beverage no matter where your mug is placed.Other BenefitsIn addition, the mug allows for easy cleaning as the underside of the lid flips open for accessing leftover residue and is dishwasher safe. This lets your mug stay looking brand new for several months after beginning to use it. My ultimate favorite feature though is how versatile it is. Whether you’re in the mood to drink something hot or cold, this mug is not made for one specific use; but rather a world of options.I encourage you to make the decision to invest in the Contigo travel mug today! You too will be able to enjoy the various benefits with just a click of button.

It wasn't quite the shape I was looking for but the name Contigo caught my eye. I have one of their water bottles which I absolutely love so much that I bought their coffee mug based off that. That mug itself is quite nice on its own, and I think it's great for several reasons:-It has a slim base so it should fit in most cupholders-Vaccuum sealed so stays hot for hours (way longer than my old mug)-THE LID! Seriously the lid is the best part! Firstly it has an autoseal button so you don't have any chance of spilling plus it keeps the heat in between sips. No more fiddling with a spin tab or flipper top. Just depress the button with each sip. It also has a slider lock if you want extra security. Secondly, you could drink out of the ""left"" or ""right"" side of this mug without any adjustment. It has an equal size opening on each side, so when you drink from one side the other acts as an air vent. This may not seem like a big deal but I use my coffee mug all day. My end table is to my left when on the couch, so I drink left handed. On my commute I use the cup holder so I drink from my right. At work I'll do either depending if I'm using the computer or not. With my old mug I would constantly turn the lid so the opening was on the proper side.

Hahahahaha.  Ok no points taken away. 100% my fault.  It's pretty clear and a point is obviously I should not be driving a car if I cannot figure out where the liquid is coming from.One reviewer was complaining because it did not fit well in the cup holder in her car.  Nice lady but not much more than me in the logic department I guess.  She showed you three other items she placed in her cupholder.  Not one fit properly.  The soda can too loose and the others all some issue.  Basically a terrible vehicle cupholder.  My cupholder has three rubber pieces at the sides bottom about 2-3 inches up.  It locks anything in beautifully.  Blaming the unit because the car sucks is silly.Lastly I found it isn't very good at keeping the coffee hot.  After 45 minutes it's luke warm and it was almost too hot to drink initially.Lastly after about a year of using the cup about once a week at most meaning some weeks no times a week I find the flow is diminished.  It seems related to the little rubber stopper over the drink hole.  Now in my case this may be a positive since less coffee will pour in my lap if it's not a free flowing.  This also speaks well of it not being as hot after 45 minutes since again when pouring coffee in lap better lukewarm then burning hot.All in all it is a very good product and I recommend it.

These mugs are a miracle for my wife and I. When we make ourselves coffee in the morning, we aren't always able to drink it all right away, depending on what is happening with our children. These mugs seriously stay warm forever! I'm writing this review at 3:00pm, and my coffee that I made at 8:00am is still warm (obviously not hot, but not lukewarm either - definitely pleasantly warm.)They also are amazing for spill proof. My toddler loves to grab our mugs and teeth on the lids. We've never had a problem with any coffee going anywhere, though. Pre-pandemic, my wife threw this into her backpack or her purse when she traveled to work, and never had any issues either.The silver are the best to get. The colored options are all cool - we had a black and a blue, too. However, it's not a great idea to put the colored ones in the dishwasher - the paint will start to chip and break off. It's still totally usable, but it definitely no longer looks good. However, you don't have the same issue with the silver - it's just the natural metal color, so no flaking or anything when running the whole mug through the dishwasher.I've also found these mugs great for bottle feeding on the go. Both my kids have liked warm formula. With this, we can easily bring along warm water with us, and then fill the bottles when we're ready to feed.These also fit in our Keurig. I'll be honest, I don't remember which model we have, so I know that's probably not sure helpful. But we just need to remove the drip pan on the bottom, and these fit right in.End of the day, they are amazing mugs, and I highly recommend them!","Incredible mug - stays warm, doesn't leak",Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 16 OunceColor: Stainless SteelVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,157,66,Public,1263059

My tea is “warm enough I suppose” after half an hour, but definitely not HOT as with my old mug. The locking feature has worked well, but it sputters and dribbles all over the place when I open it. I absolutely cannot drink from this, especially on the go. I’ve been using it as a storage thermos and pouring into a separate cup, but even so I have to have napkins around when I set it back down. The final straw was this morning when I didn’t time the sequence of pressing the release and tipping the mug EXACTLY right, and hot (or maybe it was just “warm enough I suppose”) tea sprayed all over my desk and myself.

If you want a cold (or hot) beverage hours and hours after you first poured it, Contigo is the way to go. I can't believe how long their mugs maintain the temperature of whatever you put into them. It is truly amazing.However, I noticed that some were 14 oz and others were 16 oz and that the latter seemed to always cost more. When I ordered a 14 oz though, I found out. The reason is the mouthpiece (where the cup touches your mouth). Anybody who's had one that's a few years old knows that there's a recessed area at that spot that causes the liquid to go out of the cup and down the sides of your face. You have to kind of purse your lips a certain way to avoid wearing your drink if your on the go. (Sitting still isn't that much of an issue.)My reason for returning this is that they failed to mention that in the description. I already have a 'dribbler' cup. That's when the fact that they sold mugs so close in size (14 and 16 oz) started to make sense. They obviously know about their design flaw in the earlier models and fixed it. But they really should let folks know. So, for those of you who think you can ride your bike on rough terrain, or even on your patio, without spilling anything on your shirt when you take a one-handed drink, think again. It ain't gonna happen with this style Contigo. Forget about going with the cool black color and start getting friendly with 'plum' or some other stand-out, and spend a couple of dollars more to get the 16 oz size with the newer screw cap design that does not dribble---nor make you do it either. And watch out for the difference between the ""Autoseal"" and the ""Snapseal."" The 'Auto' seals itself and is truly a godsend. The Snapseal has to be manually closed in order to be spillproof.

The “Transit” model is prettier in my opinion.  The twirling cover is a nice feature.  But  sadly, I don’t like it as much as the “west loop” model.  It’s about the mouth piece.  With the “transit” model, you have to slurp to get your drink into your mouth.  With the “west loop” you just tilt and suck it in.  No slurping.That being said, I bought these mugs so I can drink Mio flavored water without my kids knowing I have flavored water in there.  I have only drank cold beverages from these.  If, however, I was going to drink something hot (hot chocolate), the slurping from the “transit” might be better because it would allow me to test the heat with my upper lip prior to drinking.  I don’t think the “west loop” would allow this as well and one might be more likely to burn one’s mouth.I purchased 2 “west loop” contigos after my initial trial of the two cups.  Size wise, I’ve really liked the smaller 16oz over the slightly larger 20 oz.  It fits under my fridge tap better than the larger size. The 20 oz is fine as well, but it’s a little harder to see what I’m doing when filling it because it doesn’t quite fit and has to be tilted to go under the fridge tap.  Hope this helps!I have used the flip up straw contigos for years, but I have doubt that I actually prefer the “west loop” mug even for drinking water over the straw versions.  The reason is because I felt like I had to unscrew lid on the flip top straw Contigo a little in order to not have to work at getting a drink of water because of the seal on the flip tops doesn’t allow enough air, so I would have to suck really hard if I didn’t vent the lid.

It leaks, gets nasty inside, is finicky to clean, and -- the worst part by far -- just does NOT keep coffee hot.  I think the reasoning is the lid is ""hollow"" if you look inside, so there's quite a bit of space, like 1"" or 1.5"" vertically, from the lip of the actual steel mug to the top of the plastic lid, where it isn't ""vacuum-sealed"" or ""double-walled"" or whatever.  So there's a lot of heat transfer through the cheap, thin plastic lid.  I've had other travel mugs in other brands, Thermos mostly (whose lids all broke, I hate those too) but they kept the same coffee WAY hotter for WAY longer.  My new idea to try is I just bought a small double-walled HydroFlask type bottle to function as a thermos with a wide mouth, so I'm going to try that (it's coming today actually!).

It worked well and I discarded it because an outer rubber grip failed.I have been using the cup for 9 months on a daily basis and the ""deficiencies"" I mentioned may not be such a big problem.

Pushing the button 1st before tipping is a no-brainer. no problem here, but the lid is so much taller than others & it's impossible to tell how much to tip it to get a sip.

Mine is the 20 oz. version, so it won't fit in most single cup makers & the top is quite small so 2 of my pour-over set-ups won't work.3. Straight diameter with no real flair at the top means that, although it might fit in most car cup holders, it won't work in ring type holders that don't have a bottom.4. Lid is tricky to get on right. The instructions explain how to do it. I was an aircraft mechanic all my life, so I know about how to start fittings to avoid cross- threading, but it still takes a few tries sometime & then you still don't know until you do a test tip.

TL;DR: they changed the material and/or construction of the bottom half a few years ago, and the mugs no longer insulate as claimed.I got one of these before they had the sliding lock on top of the lid release, and it was one of the best products I have ever owned.  As a religious coffee drinker who is always rushing in the morning and never certain when I would actually get to finish my coffee (based on a hectic work schedule) this mug ensured it would be hot as long as I got to it by lunch time.  I was so happy with it I (ALMOST) shared it on my social media outlets!It checked all these boxes for me:- spill proof unless you really dropped the wrong way- open handle allowed the mug to fit most cupholders and could slide into a lunch bag pocket (If my hands were really full I found I could even hang it on my pants pocket to open a door!)- a BREEZE to clean.  The finish of the bottom has not held up against the dishwasher, but having the top be so easy to clean was enough for me (this is a very function-over-form item for me in case that wasn't already obvious!)- It actually held up to Contigo's claims of all day cold or 4-hour hot drinks.I later bought the same mug for my wife since she saw how well it worked for me.  Hers arrived with the new style lid with the top lock.  The handle broke within a few days, but Amazon replaced it with no issue.  The second time around there have been no issues with the handle, but neither mug ever kept her coffee hot for more than an hour or so.  I still have my original (purchased in 2013 or 2014), and it still works great in terms of insulation.  It no longer holds the rubber stoppers on top of the lid as tightly, but it would still protect from a bit spill and only leak slightly if tipped over.  I don't know what was changed about the newer version, but it's unfortunate Contigo seemed to trade quality for an extra feature (the top locking lid).  To be clear, the new lid doesn't change the insulation properties (I have tested both with my Thermoworks thermometer).  If I use my old mug bottom with my wife's new lid, I still get hot coffee for 4 hours.  If she uses my non-locking lid on her mug bottom, it still doesn't insulate.The locking lid is a nice feature to have, but honestly I rarely use it.  The normal handle release is enough of a spill proof seal for me  (and I'm fine with the seal wearing out with daily use after 2-3 years - I would just replace it that often if I could).  I would much rather just have a mug that insulates as it claims with or without the locking top.  Now I'm stuck hoping mine doesn't break because there doesn't seem to be a viable replacement for it!",Change in material/design killed a great product.

I was a freshman in college and the guy I was seeing had the plastic cold-water-only version of this bottle. When I first saw it I was confused. I thought the button was stupid and overly complicated. Little did I know this bottle would come to be a staple in my life. On mornings when I was hungover, I would reach out and grab the nearest hydration. This trusty bottle was always there. The size of the opening allowed just the right amount of water though so I wasn't drowning but I also was getting hydrated with the speed and desperation of a hamster post-hibernation. (No, I don't actually know whether hamsters hibernate. Sorry.)Anyway, the button saved me so many times. Often when lying in bed I might drop my phone on my face. The same is true of a water bottle. If I had had just a normal, sad water bottle, I would have spilled water all over my face. This bottle, however, closes the second you release the button, protecting me from the curse of my own weak arms. It was truly a hydration miracle and I brought it with me everywhere.Flash forward to 2016, the dark times. At some point in the computer science building, I lost the bottle. Legend says if you walk the halls at night you can still hear the echos of my screams: ""Where are you? I can't live without you! Somebody help me!"" My boyfriend suggested that I look online and find a replacement. I scorned the idea, no water bottle could replace my water bottle. He pointed out that the bottle was actually his but I would not hear it.Eventually, when the time for mourning had passed tenfold, I decided it was time to get back in the saddle. I went online tentatively. I thought I was taking things slow, but when I saw that Contigo was no longer manufacturing this model, I was heartbroken. Still, I didn't give up. I went on eBay and was still able to find one, albeit I'm the wrong color. Nonetheless, this new bottle found a way into my heart.We spent many loving years together. Eventually, my bottle was covered in as many scratches as stickers. The plastic began to become dry and cracked. This is no fault of the manufacturer, given that I bought it secondhand and that I used it for four years diligently every day. Also I dropped it all the time. My poor bottle was becoming worse for wear. Nevertheless, no one could replace this bottle in my mind.One day, I opened an incognito tab and went online just to see what was out there. I wasn't expecting to find much, but I saw this. Contigo had begun making the same bottle, but this time thermally insulated. I stared at it for a long time. I read reviews. I put it in my cart and took it out again. Eventually, I convinced myself I would use it for tea. I told my old bottle that it was for a different purpose, that it would never be the same.Alas, I was wrong. I regret my foolish promise deeply, but I had to follow my heart. This new bottle is, in fact, superior. Not only does it keep tea hot all day, but it also keeps water cold and refreshing in the summer. It is two rolled in one, the love child of my previous bottles, and I adore it. Thank you Contigo.P.s. I couldn't fit these things into my story but it's easy to clean and the metal doesn't keep flavors in so plain water tastes good even after it was previously full of smoothie. My only complaint is that it leaks a little at the seam if you don't close it tight enough and you have a hot drink. I think this is because the steam expands the rubber seal slightly.

Since then I have used it many times indoors or on short trips, and just finished a week-long vacation that had it sitting on a hot beach with no protection other than the shade of an umbrella.

The inside of the lid is easier to clean because of the re-design that allows it to be popped open - however - be VERY CAREFUL when you open it - if you accidentally dislodge the inner piece - by pulling and moving to quickly, it is challenging to put back in. I found a video on you tube to help me out and I spent about 20 minutes trying to hold a couple of springs open while carefully clicking the part back in place. I was determined, because it was the first time I cleaned it and I hadn't even used it yet. ARGH! Since I learned the hard way - I open the inner working of the lid with a bit more knowledge - because I don't want to do that again.  I would recommend finding a video to show how to pop open the inside of the lid for cleaning - before doing it. However - this feature would not stop me from buying another. I love that you can open it and really get it clean.Even with my initial oops, I love this mug. It is nice and sturdy, I have found it completely leak proof. I even fill two of them for the day and toss them into my tote bag - they roll around and are rarely upright by the time I get to work - no leaks.2. With the West Loop version, I have noticed that I have to be a little more careful about making sure the lid is really level when I start to turn it to secure it in place. The Aria versions you could just put the lid on and turn and go, but they were really hard to get REALLY clean. This new model is a bit trickier to keep completely level for its snug securing - (not quite sure why, but it does appear to have less threading, so you spin it fewer times and have less room for leveling) - but if you take a moment and possibly take off and on to make sure it is secure - it is worth the extra step. If I could change one thing, it would be how tedious it can be to put the top on properly. If it is not a day that I'm in a rush - no problem. However, any day that I'm in a rush, I usually don't think to level it perfectly and always have to start over with a couple of extra exclamations - mostly because I didn't have time to spend playing with a lid.I still love this mug. It has survived a drop or two - maybe a dent as well, keeps my coffee hotter than expected. It is a nice plus that they are making these mugs in some great colors too.",Hot drinks that don't spill - what more could you want?

So based purely on several reviews here at Amazon I went ahead and bought  a 24oz Contigo Auto Seal West Loop. I looked at it for ~3 days before finally using it for the first time,  I finally got around to using it yesterday morning. I usually pour my coffee at boiling since I need it to stay warm so long. Though the instructions say to let the boiling coffee cool down for 3 minutes before applying the lid. I hated doing this but I let it cool down for 2.5min before applying the lid. I sat down at my desk and took my first sip from my new cup. It was a bit awkward because I had to tilt back the cup further back than I am used to and overall the cup felt quite differently than what I am used to with my YETI style ramblers. But I finished the coffee in about ~1.5 hours and it turned out fine. So this morning I made my coffee and went for a YETI before I  though that I had better try the  Contigo again and that was a smart move because today it already feels like I have owned this cup a long time!

It lasted over four years despite being dropped countless times including falling to the ground at about 30 mph after I forgot that I had put it on the roof of the car while putting something in the trunk!

It took me a long time to find something that seemed to fulfill my needs. First of all, it's the perfect size. It's just enough to fit what I need (and usually more), but still can fit in my car's cupholder or the pocket on the side of my backpack. It keeps your drink hot for a long time, which is great. Sometimes I even use it at home for my tea at night because I hate when it gets cold. It's easy to drink out of too. It took me a day or two to get used to pushing the button to be able to drink - at first I found it annoying, and almost regretted my purchase, but after only one or two uses, I didn't even notice it anymore. It's also leakproof, at least so far. I haven't tested its limits by letting it sit upside down, but I've often accidentally knocked it over in my car or backpack or something, and never had an issue. The ONLY thing I would like to improve is the cleaning. Overall, it's definitely not bad. I've had water bottles and other similar products that have been way harder to clean and have quickly developed mold. Not so with this. I love that you can disassemble the lid so easily by just pushing a button essentially, and that it can go in the dishwasher. The only annoyance is that the bottom portion must be cleaned by hand. Also, now that I moved and don't have a dishwasher, I've found cleaning the lid thoroughly by hand is definitely trickier. I don't feel as confident that I'm cleaning it well enough and getting into all the nooks and crannies. Still, I'm happy so far and would consider purchasing again if I needed a new one.

Given it's coffee, I'd like to put the whole thing in the dishwasher, but you can't, per the instructions. I think it has to do with the finish. The only thing that MIGHT get problematic is that I doubt he'll rinse out the lid after every use and the coffee might end up gunking up the lid, but that's what dishwashers are for.

I noticed today when I went to take it out in the morning (I don't use it much these days, so it's been months) that the rubber around the lid / head which you're meant to grip has become sticky. It's rubber reversion, something that happens when the chemicals keeping the rubber at its proper, vulcanized texture start to fail. Same thing happened with one of my PS4 controllers. It's as if you left it out in the sun too long, but all it was doing was sitting in a cabinet.This might sound like a small complaint because, hey, it lasted me four years, but I don't think it's small at all. If you'll forgive me my soapbox, now more than ever we must be aware of what we're consuming and how much longevity / disposability our money buys us. Everywhere around us are things we're meant to buy and discard. In a class I took two terms back, it was pointed out that 99% of everything which is manufactured in the modern world is discarded within 6 months.I understand how corporations work, I get that the profit model of modern capitalism relies on us replacing things, and that a fridge or a microwave can't be expected to last 50 years like they used to.

I can't recommend somebody buy a mug like this, knowing that in less than half a decade they may have to throw it out because it's simply gotten too disgusting to use. I want to buy things that last, and when you pay $20-30 for a damn travel mug, you expect it to last.One other quick note. For a long time my mugs were dripping and I thought that was a new and disappointing revelation. It turned out I had gotten the lids switched on the stainless and painted models. But they're identical. They just don't sit quite right if they're not on the mug they shipped with. I don't know what the deal is, but it's bizarre and I don't like it. It further makes me wonder if I did decide to seek out a replacement lid (do they even sell those?) would it even fit, or would it leak as well?I don't know what the answer is for my complaints, but to add ""doesn't have grippy rubber anywhere on it"" to the list of things I look for in a travel mug.

I've never used it for anything hot so I can't say anything on that end, but considering how it's held up in every other way, I'd expect it to work just as well.Perfect cup for the price, and it doesn't seem like it'll be breaking anytime soon.","Had for 2 1/2 months, nearly flawless cup",Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 20 OunceColor: Matte BlackVerified Purchase,,,140,50,Public,407371

It's easy to use and, with the lid locked, it will not leak. Do be careful, however, if you place it in a bag, because, as I found out with my other one, if the lock button accidentally gets hit and unlocks, it is possible for it to leak a bit. Try and keep it upright if you put it in a bag. Or get a thermos if you're dead set on carrying this in bags.As Shawn M. said, read the instructions and you'll not have any problems.

Other types of mugs either don't insulate so well or have a vent in the top to release steam and thereby avoid this risk.

I will have to write a new one.At first, I liked this travel mug. While it does hold its claim of keeping your beverages either hot or cold, the mug itself is what bothers me. More specifically, the lid. I do not recommend using this mug for multiple beverages. The plastic lid tends to hold the flavor of whatever was in the mug before it. For example, one day I had coffee in it. I washed the lid thoroughly (even soaked it in mildly soapy hot water, like it suggests), and the next day I decided that I wanted cold Kool-Aid. When I went to drink from the mug, (I tend to suck in a tiny amount), I was blasted with a plasticy-coffee-y taste, and it really wasn't pleasant. The only way to counteract this is to blow into the mug while drinking, and that can be a bit confusing if you know what I mean.Other than this annoyance, the mug itself is great. It keeps my hot beverages hot and my cold beverages cold. Perhaps I need to purchase several mug lids and ensure that I only use one beverage per lid. That way, I won't have to worry about flavor holding amongst beverages. I don't plan on purchasing more lids, however, because that really ruins the convenience of a travel mug. I also understand most of these mugs are designed with coffee in mind, and if you only put coffee in it, you won't notice the flavor holding because it'll just taste like coffee. But if you put any other drink it in, you will taste whatever was in it before.I hope, in the future, a new all-metal lid comes out from this company. If they use aluminum throughout, then it will be nearly impossible for flavors to hold, and I'll be much happier. I'm only going to remove one star from this review because otherwise this mug is great.

I requested a couple of the 16 oz. mugs as Christmas gifts last December, and they perform just as described.  My main reason for wanting them was for ice water and they work perfectly.  Water stays cold for hours.  I can put a mug of water with several ice cubes on my nightstand when I go to sleep, and there's still ice in it 12 hours later.  I don't drink hot drinks often so that's just a bonus feature for me.  Tea stays steaming hot for a couple of hours; as I gradually sip it, the ambient air that replaces the liquid in the mug cools down the rest of the tea, but it's stayed warm for up to 6 hours.  The mugs and lids are easy enough to clean, but then again, since I mostly drink water from them, they don't get too nasty.  I frequently add a packet of flavoring to my water (like Propel, True Lemon, or Crystal Light type stuff) and one of my lids has gotten stained inside from a pink lemonade mix, but that hasn't affected functionality.The only negative, if it can be considered a down side, is that the capacity is exactly as stated.  The 16 oz. size holds exactly 16 ounces of liquid to the fill line.  Many bottled waters are 500 ml/16.9 oz. so a full bottle will overflow the 16 oz. size mug, especially if you add ice to the mug.  That's why I ordered the 20 oz. size mug, which works perfectly to hold a bottle of water plus ice.I do wish the 20 oz. mugs came in a wider variety of colors, especially in the matte finish.  I prefer the stainless and matte colored mugs because I feel like I can keep a better grip on them; the shiny colors seem slicker.

This product doesn't have a depression (i.e. a small pit or a cavity) that can serve as a reservoir for your sip. (See picture I attached with the good one and this one, the bad one.)  When you sip hot coffee a little bit of that coffee needs to rest somewhere so you can moderate the temperature with your mouth and air at the same time. However, this model doesn't have a place to provide the reservoir to sip, it just goes directly into your mouth. If you drink is hot, you have no way to moderate the temperature before it goes into your mouth. Because of this, this is a TERRIBLE travel mug to use while driving.

The Contigo, is pretty good, but has a few slight drawbacks that keep it from being great.There is a learning curve with using this properly as others have mentioned. You have to press the autoseal button before raising the tumbler to your mouth & tipping it to drink (to release pressure build-up). As you drink you can't chug on this. You've got to sip as the lid design doesn't allow for a heavier flow of liquid to pour. When lowering it's important to keep the button pressed in to allow any excess liquid to drain back into the tumbler or you could wear a few drops as there isn't much of a ridge along the lip (like a canned beverage) for the excess to go. So it either needs to go back into the tumbler or on you. I personally have found that dragging your upper lip & slurping slightly as you lower it, with the button still pressed, helps to avoid having too much excess liquid. It sounds more difficult in detailed explanation, but you get it much easier in actual usage & after a while it becomes more natural.Despite the learning curve, it does work well as long as you learn how to properly use it. As I said, it sounds more difficult in written explanation than in actual physical usage. One thing that I think would significantly improve the design would be to widen the small ridge along the lip of the drinking hole to allow the excess liquid a place to go to then flow back into the tumbler easier as you lower it after taking a swig. This might be nitpicking, but I think it would greatly improve the design & functionality.As for the other reviews that complain of leakage through the threaded area between the lid & tumbler, I have not had this problem. But in my experience with other tumblers I can safely say that this is generally due to 3 things. 1) Not properly tightening the lid. Either being not screwed on tight enough or over-tightening the lid (this can cause too much torque on the seal itself, warping the seal). 2) Filling too high, which can easily cause liquid to seap through the seal when the lid is screwed on. I've found that you should never fill above the lowest thread line. 3) In tumblers that utilize a gasket seal, it's possible that the gasket becomes dislodged, especially after being cleaned in the dishwasher. I don't physically see a gasket on this tumbler. Not one that could be dislodged anyway. This is a good thing.The ability to lock the seal is a nice feature that I use when my 2yo daughter is around. But I haven't just tossed it in a bag or something where it could be inverted. I have physically locked it & inverted it & shaken it just to see how well it works & it didn't leak. But I honestly haven't tested this feature it to it's fullest extent.Overall I give it 4 stars. Despite the fact that there is a bit of a learning curve, it does work well. If they increased the ridge around the drinking hole however, this would be worthy of 5 stars as it is an almost perfect design.",Almost perfect in design,Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 20 OunceColor: Stainless SteelVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,,121,37,Public,2667931

You have to open your mouth wider than you'd expect in order to keep liquids from spreading out sideways past the hole and spilling on you. I find it awkward to get my mouth to seal effectively around this opening to avoid spills. If your liquid is really hot you don't want a big mouthful of it, but you can't sip with a ""small mouth"" without spilling. The leakproof part is fine and the temperature retention is fine, but the ""human interface"" design is seriously flawed.

All in all, it takes about 30-45 days by the time you finally get a replacement in the mail.Is all this worth it and would I recommend buying this product?

My kids take them and leave them at friends houses. This mug costs a bit more than ten bucks and is worth EVERY PENNY.  I'm going to write to Contigo and beg them never to drop the standard design.  There is a cool little lock on top of the lid which prevents accidental spillage from the drinking hole; it locks down the push button.  So you could put it in a pouch in a backpack and not worry about accidentally activating the push button.  This is an iconic mug which has never been imitated or improved on. Take my word; order 2.

This is unacceptable for a big company. They just sit there collecting our hard earned money and run their business not caring about the repeated problems people are having with it.  Its probably like writing to China would be.  If Contigo was smart they would offer replacement lids but they don't. It would probably cost the same as the cup.

I wanted a flask that could hold enough for a day and one that would keep it hot at least most of the day. I decided to give this a try after doing a bit of research.First the good news:1. Large enough to hold a lot of coffee!2. Nice sleek looking design3. Slim enough to fit in most cup holders and easy to carry around4. Easy to operate with one hand5. The lock is nice and reliable6. The cap doesn’t take much space inside the flask so you can fill it close to the brim without fear of spilling coffee while tightening the cap (this is something I really appreciate!)7. It retains temperature very well. The coffee remained hot enough for about 6 hours and was then warm enough for another two ( You will usually run out of coffee by the 6 hour mark anyway!)Now the few cons:1. Since it is slim, it is not that easy to give it a good wash. You may want to buy a dedicated brush to clean the flask.2. The inside of the cap is difficult to clean as well. I end up using a tooth brush to clean it well as the caffeine residue will not come out easily and not all areas of the cap are easy to reach with just fingers or a sponge.3. Since the opening on the cap is quite small, it is not easy to assess the hotness of the drink till you take the first sip or you unscrew the cap. With a generic flask, I could open the lid easily and kinda make sense of the temperature, no such luck with this one. It will take a few days to get a hang of it ( I did get my tongue burnt once or twice)Overall, if the cons sound bad, then it is better to go with a manual seal one rather than the auto seal.

Of course, I’ve only used it once, so far.  I have noticed that a tiny bit (about one drop) of coffee does remain in the sipping well, after each sip.  But that residual is so small it doesn’t end up dripping onto my shirt, even if I tip the mug upside down.  And I’m one of those people who usually end up wearing a sample of almost every beverage I drink.  My wife refers to the front of my shirts as “today’s menu.”So far I really love this mug.  With that having been said, I will be updating this review after giving this mug more than just a trial run.  For now, at least, it’s earned all five stars.",Works Perfectly,Style: No HandlePattern Name: MugColor: ChardVerified Purchase,,,2205,357,Public,5799

It really does not leak as long as you follow the directions - tighten the lid all the way, press the release button before tilting it to drink.

I have left iced tea in a car with the hot summer sun beating down and chugged a nice cold glug when I got back from shopping. I flew with this mug - emptied it before going through security, of course, then refilled with cold water fountain water and an instant-drink packet, tossed into my carryon, and had a nice cold drink throughout the flight without paying inflated airline prices.

A product that simply does a decent job at what it claims to do earns a 4-star rating. It takes something exceptional to get 5 stars from me. THIS MUG IS EXCEPTIONAL. I haven't had any problems so I can't speak to their warranty service. But for my money, if you want a truly leakproof and temperature-keeping travel mug, this is the ONLY choice.2-year followup Oct. 27, 2018: After 2 years of intermittent use, both of the mugs I bought still work great. I tend not to use them much in the house because I don't want to risk not having one clean and ready to use when I am heading out for any length of time and want to take a drink along.

With my old Stanley cup, there was a lip on the edge that allowed me to “slurp” the coffee from the lip as it poured out.  The slurping helped me to avoid burning my lips from the hot coffee.  With this Contigo cup, there is no lip.  When you tilt the cup and open the spout, the coffee WILL make full direct contact with your lips as it exits.  Because of this, I have to rate it at just below average.  I’ve included a photo of the green Stanley beside the black Contigo to try and illustrate.

After 20 minutes or so she takes them out of the freezer and pours them into my mugs and puts the lids on. Being careful they don't freeze.

What a great find!  It solves 2 problems:  (1) sipping coffee in the morning - I don't have to keep running to the microwave to heat coffee if I drink it slowly, like I would with a regular coffee cup, and (2) sipping coffee while driving - I've been using disposable styrofoam cups/lids.  I'm really impressed with this.  It fits fine in my Volvo cup holder, with room to spare.  It's easy for me to grab (I have small hands).  When I'm driving in the dark, I can easily tell where the spout is going to be because you can feel the large button on the back of the cup that you have to push to open the spout.  With styrofoam cups in the dark, it can be tricky to tell where the opening is.  The design is lovely; it looks pretty.  Just one caution - IF you're going to drink it right away - let your coffee cool off a bit (or put some cold milk in with it) before putting the lid on, because this thing keeps coffee as hot as when you put it in there, and you won't like having your tongue singed.  IF you're going to drink it once you get to work - the heat will dissipate a little after 10-20 minutes, and won't be quite so hot after that.  But if you pour boiling water/coffee, better let it cool before putting the lid on.  --  Also, if you want to sanitize it in your dishwasher, be sure to get the ""stainless steel"" color and not a painted color, and put it on the top rack.  Plain stainless steel is ok in the dishwasher.  I just wash mine with warm soapy water and use an OXO bottle brush, which also cleans the grooves.  I got two, so I can always have at least one clean and ready to go.  Also, try to rinse them out when you finish your coffee; makes it easier to clean later.",I'm really impressed with this!

I loved it, because having gone through so many thermoses and water bottles, I never had an issue with it leaking. I had the thermos for 3 years. It was all beat up but still worked and best of all still didn't leak. Finally, I thought it's time for a new thermos and I had to go with Contigo again.Temperature: Plus it maintains the temperature of the liquids, whether hot or cold, for hours. I do think it maintains the hot temperature longer than cold temperature though. But, I mostly use this for my teas or coffee and use a separate reusable bottle for my cold water.Design: It's the perfect size for holding or throwing in your purse, not too bulky. In terms of drinking, I prefer this one with the lock mechanism on the top, where you have to hold the button down in order to drink. I've had another thermos with the flip top mouth piece and find that I would forget to close it or it will leak if I didn't click it into place all the way. This style of thermos top is much more foolproof as it only opens a hole for drinking when you press the button down. Just be sure to hold it away from you when you go to open it for your first sip, otherwise you'll get squirt with boiling hot tea or coffee on your face. Not pleasant!

My requirements were a) keep the coffee hot, b) don't leak while walking or if I put it in my backpack, and c) allow me to drink while walking without spilling.This thing meets all those requirements. That in itself is not enough to get me to write a review, but this morning, I had the thermos stuck in the side of my backpack. I took off the backpack, and the Contigo flew out and landed hard on concrete - hard enough to knock the lid off thread.  The lid did not come off though. I ended up leaking about a teaspoon of coffee, and the thermos itself wasn't even dented, though it did get a few scratches (see pic).So I'm very happy with my purchase.  Some reviewers have commented on the pushbutton sealing mechanism... it's a bit complicated internally (a pivot, lever and spring that pushes a small silicone pad up against the underside of the opening), but it's easy to use, reliable and durable. If you have a hot drink in there and push the button, you can get a small burst of escaping pressure, which leads to the warning and instructions to orient the thermos properly, yada yada yada. It's simple and you'll figure it out in five seconds. The burst of pressure means that the thermos is actually SEALING, unlike other leakier ones. So to me it's a feature, not a problem.Highly recommended.","Works Well, Durable",Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 16 OunceColor: Stainless SteelVerified Purchase,,,88,36,Public,1698927

Just put a tea bag in the infuser, pop the infuser onto the bottom of the mug lid and go. No need to wait for the tea to brew or for tea bag strings to be hanging out of the mug.There are two potential downsides to this mug. First is the durability of the finish. The first mug I has was the Latte color and I found that with regular use, the finish would scratch off easily, and the outside shell of the mug would dent easily if dropped even a small distance. I don't know if all of the colors will have this issue (I assume that the stainless color would not have a ""painted-on"" finish, for example) but the Latte color one definitely does, as well as my second one, which is black. This is purely cosmetic, however, and does not affect the functionality of the mug.The second potential downside to the mug is the difficulty in sipping hot drinks. The way the mouthpiece is designed, it is a little difficult to sip a very hot drink, as the way the mug handles is more of an ""all or nothing"" type of thing. This is definitely worse at first until you become used to how the mug works, but it is definitely something to be aware of.Overall though, this is a wonderful mug, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to carry liquids with them.",Awesome Mug!,Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 20 OunceColor: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,695,49,Public,630114

I wanted to try another manufacturer and this Contigo was rated fairly well in the reviews.  Rightly so.  The mug is very impressive and does a great job of keeping the contents either hot or cold for hours.  Coffee will not retain the same temp as first brewed but it does stay hot/warm enough to enjoy for a LONG time.  The lid seals nicely with less than a full turn.  Contents do not come out the opening unless you depress the button on the opposite side so it is great if it tips over - nothing will come out.  The Contigo thermal mug is the perfect height to fit under the Keurig coffee maker to dispense a full 12 ounce.  It can also be filled with more up close to the brim and the top placed on it without squeezing out the excess like my Thermos lid does.  This Contigo Travel Mug has now become my go-to mug of choice over the Thermos which I enjoyed for many years.,Great travel mug!,Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 16 OunceColor: BlackVerified Purchase,,,13,15,Public,4149157

I'm just not going to take sips, period.  I don't like returning products as I find that wasteful if I can still get some use out of it.Update 7/13/18 - I've figured out how to use this mug without it leaking.  I just have to make sure no liquid is in the top part of the mug when I take a sip.  This might be from the mug having been shaken or tipped prior to the sip or simply from condensation.  Simply tap the bottom of the mug on your hand to shake any droplets off the inside mechanism then operate the push button and drink normally.  Changing the star rating from 2 to 4.  Oh, a bonus tip.  If you close the seal while sipping, you can have the contents partially vacuum sealed and there will be even less chance of internal pressure pushing out liquid when tipped.Update 8/27/18 - Still loving it.  No spills since my initial incorrect use.  I also have no worries with the mug in any orientation in my backpack.  Warm drinks have been staying warm long enough for me to consume the contents.

With how happy I've been with Contigo products in the past, and knowing that they stand behind their products, I will definately purchase & recommend their cups again.Updated:  After 6 months of use, my cup suddenly leaks badly.  I've owned several Contigo cups over the years and have never had this issue before.  The first leak that started was with the valve.  When you go to take a sip, the liquid pours all over you.  Later, for no reason at all, (it wasn't dropped or damaged otherwise just before it started leaking), I can longer screw the lid on properly, so the cup itself leaks when tipped (the same issue my daughter had which I assumed was from loosing a rubber seal, but now doubt it was).  I have made a claim under the lifetime warranty on their website and will update once I'm able to get that sorted out and see if they will stand behind their product.  Very disappointed in this cup since every other Contigo cup I've purchased each lasted me several years, which is why I ordered this one, yet this one didn't make it 6 months.Original review:I use it as a water cup but have used it for tea as well (if you use it for coffee, even after washing it several times, it can hold the taste, affecting other drinks.  Will eventually go away, but takes time and effort.  I've found this true for all stainless steel cups). It holds the temperature really well (I've had ice in water last a couple hours and tea too hot to drink 3 hours after filling it).  I've never had mine leak, (there is a guarentee) but my daughters did eventually, after about 2 years of use, have hers leak by either loosing or damaging the seal inside the lid somehow.  The exterior does NOT change temperature based on what's inside, but the exterior colour of the container will wear off over time in the dishwasher, so best to only place lids in.  My last cup lasted me about 4 years with a lot of dropping, leaving it with dents, scratches, and the plate on the bottom popped off, none of which affected its effectiveness at all. My daughter finally smashed the lid at school when she borrowed it and it was knocked off her desk, so I needed to replace it (I think it hit it's dropping limit finally).

I had narrowed my choices down to the Contigo and Zojirushi.I eliminated the Zojirushi because of the flip top.  Don't need that in my line of sight while sipping coffee.  Reviews of horrendous customer service and failure to honor the 5 year warranty on failed mugs left this cup out of the running.  So that left the Contigo.I watched a YouTube video where a fellow gave the dimensions of this mug and it looked like it would fit my cup holder.  So, I bought it.  Well, seems they have changed the shape and the bottom is wider now (2 7/8"" as opposed to 2 5/8 from the video) and that doesn't fit.  Strike one!  I decided to keep the mug and figure out a way to add an aftermarket cup holder to the car so I could use.  Other reviews said it excelled in my other 3 criteria.  So, today was my first use.  Filled it with coffee around 7a and by 10a it was luke warm....not hot, so can't say I'm happy with the thermal retention properties of this mug.  Strike two.The button for drinking works well and it is quite spill proof.  I'm not going to send it back because I did use it.  I'll keep it as a ""working in the garage"" coffee mug.  But as a travel mug it fails.",Doesn't work for me.  Mediocre performance.,Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 16 OunceColor: BlackVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,,37,26,Public,3638394

You have to depress the button to drink and ""break"" the  seal and once you release the spring loaded button it is automatically sealed again. This auto-seal function ads to another great feature; it keeps your coffee warm for longer, or your  cooldrink cold for longer. For one of my friends that got one as a gift, this was a big plus.The design itself is great. But just some advice: unfortunately it doesn't fit into the cup holders of my toyota hilux double cab 2014 model Legend 45. Are these sizes not standard? It does however fit in the new land cruiser station wagon cup holders. It would be nice if vehicle manufacturers or cup designers can keep to a standard.

It had a good run of nearly years, so while I brought it everywhere, I didn't mind spending the money to get a-now-fourth replacement. I'm glad I did. The latest version of the autoseal top has finally found an effective way to make cleaning much easier. The mechanism itself lifts out. That takes away 90% of the problems associated with cleaning. It still requires a pipe cleaner or straw cleaner to clean out the actual autoseal gasket, but the rest of the mechanism is easy to clean.

I've previously only ever had Starbucks brand spill-proof cups, so I was hesitant to purchase another brand.  But I was tired of loosing the more expensive Starbucks cups, and at almost half the price, I decided to give this a try.I like the concept of how the spill-proof trigger works.  It opens easily for cleaning.  I can tell that you need to follow the manufacturer's directions of rinsing the cup out right after use, though.  If you've used these spill-proof cups in the past, you probably know the mistake of forgetting that last sip of coffee in the cup and leaving it for a day or five.  It's nasty and you have to scrub the heck out of the cup to get the stank out.  And then throw it in the dishwasher twice.  Well, with this cup, there is the spring in the lid mechanism, there is the hinges of the lid mechanism... all sorts of little nooks and crannies where stanky gunk could get get lodged and really hard to scrub out.  So yeah, I think this cup is great so far, but I know I can't be forgetful like I've been with my old cups.Also, the spill-proof mechanism works very well right now.  I'm worried about so many moving parts that are involved in keeping it spill-proof, though. Time will tell if the spring and hinges will hold their strength and keep the cup spill-proof.  Even my higher-priced Starbucks cups would start to degrade their spill-proof nature as the rubber seals wore down, usually after about 2 years of daily use.",Works Great Now - Time will tell,Style: No HandlePattern Name: 1 16 OunceColor: Stainless SteelVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,55,54,Public,4925678
