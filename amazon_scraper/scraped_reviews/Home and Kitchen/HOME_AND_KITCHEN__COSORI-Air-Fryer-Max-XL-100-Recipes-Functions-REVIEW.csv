KG,amzn1.account.AEB2XY567BUH4AOEPTZLVUKXQSHQ,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2019",5,,https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Air-Fryer-Max-XL-100-Recipes-Functions/product-reviews/B07GJBBGHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I absolutely hate cooking. I don't like the mess. It takes too much time. My recipes never turn out like they show in the cookbooks...and my cooking is pretty awful. I got the Cosori Air Fryer a couple of weeks ago, and I've been happily cooking every day, multiple times a day since.You just pull it out of the box, and it's ready to go. The detachable basket and pan are all that needed cleaning in soapy water before adding food. The buttons are self-explanatory. You've got a snowflake for frozen foods, fries for fries, bacon for bacon, and also Preheat and Keep Warm.When I first turned it on, I wasn't sure what to expect. I wondered if it was going to get hot and scorch my counter (or me). I thought it would be noisy. It was none of those things. It does get a little warm on the outside but not hot like an oven. You do need to be careful when you're pulling the basket out or any food from inside the fryer because it's deceiving that it works so quickly and gets food that hot that fast. As for noise, you can hear the air moving, but I wouldn't call it noisy. My Alexa is near the air fryer, and the Alexa hears me just fine when I'm talking while the air fryer is running. Also, since my Alexa is near the air fryer, you can tell that the air fryer doesn't get too hot or spit things at you or I wouldn't have the Alexa there.The air fryer looks great on my counter too. It's already become a conversation piece in my kitchen. I had family over this weekend, and they wanted to know what it was. I put on a kitchen demo of sorts, and everyone stood around and watched, then ate all of the food (not a crumb left on the plates!), and then they said they needed to get an air fryer too.So far, I've tried recipes in the included recipe book as well as a recipe for chicken fried steak in an air fryer cookbook I purchased separately. What's great about the cookbook included in the Cosori air fryer is that each recipe has a picture with it, and the ingredients aren't intimidating to those of you like me who don't care for cooking. Most recipes call for ingredients you've actually heard of and probably have in your pantry -- a real plus for me because I also hate wandering around in a grocery store searching for a random ingredient I'll only use once.The very first recipe I tried was sweet potato fries in the included Cosori cookbook. I like my fries a little crunchy, so I probably could have left them in the air fryer a few minutes longer than the recipe called for, but they were still delicious. Definitely the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.For fun, I then threw in some frozen okra I had bought in the freezer section. I bought a water bottle and filled it with olive oil, so all I did was lightly squirt the olive oil on the okra while in the air fryer basket and then just pushed the snowflake button. The okra came out so crunchy, just the way I like it. And I couldn't believe it had gone from frozen to crispy crunchy in just a matter of minutes. Most of them were golden brown, but I could tell the ones that I had missed when I sprayed the okra with the olive oil. Those were white -- still crunchy and tasted fine, but a weird-looking white. I've since bought a pressurized oil sprayer can that's specifically for spraying olive oil, and it works much better at spraying everything evenly than my plastic water bottle.Same night and onto my third recipe: chicken fried steak. Now, this recipe wasn't in the incuded Cosori cookbook. This particular cookbook didn't have a picture, so I wasn't at all sure how it would turn out. It's so good, I've cooked it twice in three nights.That night's entire meal was cooked in the air fryer: sweet potato fries, frozen-turned-air fried okra, and chicken fried steak. It felt like an elaborate meal with hardly any time invested, and my kitchen wasn't a disaster after cooking all of that. I only had a few plates and a couple of bowls that I'd used instead of pots and pans and baking dishes all piled up on my counter with a greasy stove to clean.The next day, I tried the mozzarella cheese sticks in the included Cosori cookbook. I totally botched this recipe, using baking soda instead of cornstarch. Did I mention how bad I am at cooking? Even so, the mozzarella sticks worked out okay (but not great, which was likely my own fault). They crisped up nicely and quickly. They just didn't look a thing like the picture in the recipe book. I would have also liked the cheese to be more melted on the inside. It seemed like the outside was really crispy and the inside wasn't really melted. This could all be because of my using the wrong ingredient, so I'll give it another shot because, even with the wrong ingredient, they weren't bad. They didn't taste like mozzarella cheese sticks, but they were still good.For dinner, I cooked the kids grilled cheese sandwiches also using the included cookbook. These didn't turn out as expected. At least I used the right ingredients this time. But the cheese wasn't gooey like it would be if you cooked it on the stove. If I had doubled the amount of cheese the recipe called for it would probably be perfect. The bread was golden brown, though. It was a bit of a pain to have to melt butter on the stove, then brush it onto the bread, then grate cheese before putting it into the air fryer. I can get a grilled cheese sandwich in a pan quicker than that, but it was still fun to try. I'll try the recipe again with more cheese. I think it's a recipe I can tinker with to make perfect.I then tried the pizza from the Cosori recipe book. I didn't use pizza dough. I prefer pita bread. I followed the instructions as if it was pizza dough, which means you preheat the air fryer, brush your crust with olive oil, and then put it in the air fryer at 320 for five minutes. Then you take it out to add toppings. On mine, I put pizza sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella, and parmesan. Pop it back into the air fryer for another five minutes at 320, and it's done. It was so good. I'll be making another for lunch. The only downside was having to cook one at a time because I couldn't fit two pieces of pita bread in the basket together.My most-recent recipe to try is the coconut shrimp, which is also in the cookbook that comes with the air fryer. What would normally be a giant mess of the kitchen was only three bowls to dredge the coconut shrimp and then a plate to put them on. You preheat the air fryer while you're getting everything ready, and then pop the shrimp in for eight minutes. They were very tasty, but I'll add more coconut in my dredge next time than the recipe calls for. The recipe was good, but I couldn't really taste the coconut.I keep picking out new recipes to try in the cookbook, which is a first for me with my loathe of cooking. I've included pictures of the country fried steak, pizza, grilled cheese, mozzarella sticks, and coconut shrimp that I've made so far.Even owning the 5.8 quart, you have to get used to cooking in batches. I wanted to make four chicken fried steaks that first night, but there was only room for two. Not a big deal. You just have to cook in batches. Making three pita bread pizzas, I just had to make each one separately since I could only fit one round piece of pita in at a time. For the grilled cheese sandwiches, two actually fit into the air fryer at the same time.Like I said before, the cookbook that comes with the air fryer is full of pictures. It also has more than 100 pages of recipes. For example, you'll find recipes for strawberry cream scones, stuffed french toast, BBQ bacon, ribeye, meatballs, fried chicken, crab cakes, wings, pigs in a blanket, french fries, onion rings, roasted corn, cheddar buttermilk biscuits, cinnamon rolls, pound cake, and orange cranberry muffins. I would be lost without the cookbook. It also tells you exactly which button to push on the air fryer too, so you're learning about how to use your air fryer while you're actually cooking instead of having to read an instruction manual cover to cover before you even have enough confidence to cook something.I mentioned not having many dishes to clean after using the air fryer. What I love most about cleanup is how easy the air fryer itself is to clean. Everything just slides off of it. I'm barely scrubbing it, and it's clean. I know the description says it's dishwasher safe, but I just wash it in the sink because there's nothing ever dried on and stuck to it. I love how I can put a little soap on it, and it's clean and ready for my next recipe. The water beads on it, so it dries really fast.The only negative about the air fryer is probably my own impatience with one of the controls. The temp/time is shared by one button. If you have a recipe that calls for you to adjust the temp and/or time, you have to toggle the button. It starts with temp, so if you need to change how long to keep something in, you hit the temp/time button again. Somehow, I keep managing to hit time when I mean temp and vice versa.Also, the air fryer cuts off when you pull the basket out, just as it should so it's not running while there's nothing in the bottom. When you pop the basket back in, it defaults back to the original temp and time settings when you turn it on, not what you last had on there. It would be nice if it remembered what your setting was 5 minutes before. For example, the other night when I had to make the pizzas in batches, I had to run the air fryer 5 minutes for one crust, then five minutes for the next, and so on. Every time, I had to reset the time and temp when I pulled a crust out. That's when I began noticing how bad I was at toggling the temp/time button I mentioned above.Both the time/temp button being shared and the air fryer not remembering your last time/temp are extremely minor downsides. But they're the only negatives I could think of because this air fryer has quickly become my favorite kitchen appliance.I have never had any experience with an air fryer, so I have nothing to compare the Cosori air fryer against. But I did my research. read the reviews, watched videos, and crossed my fingers that I was buying the right one. I couldn't have made a better choice. I'm actually excited to cook for the first time ever.

I’ve used it to cook steak which took much longer to cook than the literature suggested and it didn’t brown up at all. I’ve tried cooking French fries using raw potatoes and after nearly 30 minutes at 400 degrees I had limp fries that I wasn’t interested in eating.

I asked to speak with a manager, who basically repeated the same policy. The manager did offer to give me the contact information of the manufacturer. She made clear that they would not issue a refund, but would likely reissue another unit. I had lost confidence in the unit given how quickly it puttered out. The manager stated that the refund less the shipping was all that could be done.Left with two options, a) refund less shipping or b) risk another defective unit and another return scenario, I opted for the first option. I was, nevertheless, deeply disappointed and frustrated that Amazon came short on rectifying the situation. To be clear, I do not blame the rep or the manager. They were friendly and professional.

I think it may be ceramic but anyway she says it is a breeze to clean.She thought it was making weird noises so she contacted Customer Support and within a few hours she had a response. They asked her to video tape the unit in operation and once reviewing the video they got right back to her and said it was normal so we know they stand behind their products.My wife uses it every day making bacon, sausage and home fries for breakfast and many scrumptious meals.We get the frozen battered haddock fillets so on Fridays we make our fish fry and it cooks in half the time of the oven.She made bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and bacon wrapped fillet mignon and they came out crispy on the outside and juicy inside.I have posted a picture of our last nights dinner. She put a dry rub on the wings and cooked with fries and they too came out crispy and juicy and the fries were nice and crunchy but fluffy inside.I am so glad she kept trying fryers til she got the one that is the best available.I really do recommend purchasing this air fryer.

F for 5 minutes to eliminate any possible manufacturing/electrical residue.  There was somewhat of an electrical smell with this process, but that has been normal with other kitchen electrics I own.  (Some manuals will even direct you to run the appliance a few minutes to let it ""cure in""  and to expect an electrical odor.)  The odor dissipates and isn't an ongoing issue after curing.Started off with cooking tests of 3 inexpensive items:  meat, potatoes and bread.  I didn't use fresh items for the testing, but chose frozen sausage patties, frozen ""cubed"" hash browns, and canned biscuits.  I made certain to preheat the fryer for every item at the cooking temperature being used - the results were impressive.For the sausage patties, the fryer was preheated at 390 deg. F for 5 minutes then cooked at 390 deg. F.  Cook time was  6 minutes and patties were flipped over at 3 minutes.  The finished patties were tender and moist, just slightly browned around the edges, but not at all burnt or hard.  Wonderful result.  (Quite a bit of time saved over skillet cooked patties which I usually cook low and slow to keep them tender and avoid hardness/burning.)The fryer was cooled and preheated again at 390 deg. F.  The frozen cubed potatoes were lightly spritzed with EVOO, and cooked at 390 deg. F for 7 minutes.  With 3 minutes remaining, the potatoes were tossed well, seasoned with salt and pepper and lightly spritzed again.  (The potatoes weren't seasoned initially because I wanted to clearly see how well the fryer was browning them.)  The end result was light brown crusty edges and tender centers.  Perfect.  Better than oven roasted.Saving the canned biscuits for last,  I really thought this would be the challenge and was prepared for a re-do.  (I haven't been very successful in the past with canned biscuits in the GoWise Turbo air fryer.)  I set the fryer to preheat at 360 deg. F for 4 minutes and used the time to lightly butter both sides of the 5 biscuits.The biscuits cooked almost 5 minutes on 360 deg. F.  At 3 minutes remaining, I pulled the basket out and checked them with the intent of flipping them over.  But I decided to wait and see what the end result if they weren't flipped.  I was very surprised to see the end result were biscuits that looked as if they had been cooked in a conventional oven.  I literally could see no difference.  They rose perfectly, browned without burning and even had a light brown crust on bottom.  So there would have been no need to flip them at all -  another time saver and great looking biscuits!  Let me tell you I was happy !Keep in mind these tests weren't even run with fresh foods...so I can imagine how great fresh chicken, wings, ribs, steak, fresh seasonal vegetables and homemade breads will be!  There may be occasional tweeks with with temps and time, but from what I have seen thus far, this fryer will produce very good results if proper temp, time and techniques are used.  (And barring any unforeseen errors and issues with the unit of course.)Almost forgot to mention the KEEP WARM feature is going to be a real help to me since hubby's work hours aren't stable!  (Then there's that gorgeous cookbook that came with the fryer I need to cook through!)  Registered right away to capture the extra year warranty.P.S. - I also have the Cosori Multicooker which is a stellar performer.  It has Bake, Boil, Roast, Steam, Slow Cook (3 levels - Low/Med/High) , Saute, Simmer, Brown, Yogurt, Rice functions and also Manual programmable temperature and time input.

It seems well built and I think that most of the reviewerss that mention the basket attachment point melting on their first use screwed up and didn't put the basket latching mechanism together correctly before running the machine that way.  That is technically a product design flaw that requires a modicum of caution for inexperienced users.  If the basket is sitting loose in the tray, it's not in there correctly and you will screw your machine up.  I have used mine at the highest temp setting for quite some time (I tend to run it hot because I like my food extra done).  My basket attachment point has not had a single issue thus far and I expect it to hold up nicely as time wears on.  I know a little bit about plastics as a 3d Printing enthusiast and this stuff seems built to hold up well enough to me UNLESS you screw up putting the basket in the tray.In use, the machine works really well overall.  It fries things with very little oil needed, but if you want the same texture as actual deep fried foods, you sometimes have to add a little extra oil if something has to cook for a while.  PREHEATING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY unless you like very badly fried food.  Some foods don't react like you think they would to the massive amount of air circulation and you get kind of a staleness or dryness.  Others like the Broccoli and Cheese Veggie Tots were amazing right out of the gate when properly cooked (Best I have ever made).  Bacon in this thing is just incredible and so easy to make.  It shrinks up like mad, but it's all perfectly cooked with very little effort.  Going to try my hand at Country Ham this weekend.  Spam needs a low cook temp (320 or lower) to not flood your house with smoke (the fat in Spam has a low smoke point).  This thing is amazing at continuing the cooking process for lightly fried potato chips and tortilla chips.  No need to pay more for expensove dark russet potato chips from a major brand.  This cooker makes the cheap chips sing.Cleans easy.  The Software Design is not the best and requires a tad more button pressing than it should to use, but it's a minor complaint.  You can't press the buttons rapidly as they won't take input very quickly.  I wish the temp could go about 50 degrees higher overall, but it works pretty well regardless and it's far less messy than an actual grease deep fryer and uses less oil.",Works very well.

The brand name was unfamiliar to me, but I bought it on the strength of customer reviews, which never seem to steer me wrong.  I am SO impressed with this air fryer, and I will definitely recommend it to friends and family.  I've had it for about a month, and because of the ease of cooking and cleanup, I've used it at least once a day and more.  I am calorie and fat content conscious, so I use an oil spritzer to lightly coat my foods.  I spray the basket with cooking spray when that is a recipe detail.  I've seen so many people say that something in cooking spray makes the nonstick coating on their air fryer baskets just peel right off.  I have used cooking spray countless times in my Cosori, and the coating has held up fine.I've seen some reviewers complain about the noise and the beeping.  I am, like, say what?  I was worried about the noise, but I've got to say that the complainers may have sensitive ears.  I like to know when my Cosori is finishing a cycle.  Then I can be right there to throw in more food if I'm doing two batches or a full meal.  I don't find the beeping sound or the fan sound of the machine to be offensive AT ALL.This machine cooks like a dream, I love it, and now wonder how I lived without it.  I love the French fries made in the Cosori.  I spritz them with EVOO, salt them, and sprinkle them with Messana dried parmesan, which is incredibly flavorful and very low calorie.  Stir them in the bowl to coat them, pop them into the Cosori, and diners are moaning with delight in 15 minutes.  Delicious and guilt free!Buy this machine.  Easy to clean.  No mess in the kitchen.  Creates fabulous dishes.  Last night I was dining alone, and in six minutes I had the most delicious salmon I've ever tasted along with parmesan French fries.  My kitchen was as clean as when I started.  I can choose to wash the pan and basket by hand or throw them in my dishwasher.  It's  toss up which I choose to do.  I only know my time, which is valuable, has been cut way back in my kitchen without sacrificing meal quality.  In fact, we are eating better and healthier!  I haven't enjoyed having French fries in a very long time.  Now I can enjoy them every day if I wish.  You should soak a freshly cut up batch of potato slices for 20 minutes, so when I peel potatoes and cut them up, I do several days' worth and put any I don't use in a container filled with water.  That way they are ready to blot dry and fry whenever we want fries.  They stay nice in a raw state in water for days on end.  Don't hesitate like I did.

I literally use it everyday. I researched several before taking the leap and purchasing this one and I’m so glad I did. Large square basket that feeds atleast a family of 4. The preset buttons cook spot on. So far, I have tried the fried chicken from the recipe book and my family said it was delicious. Nice and crispy. I temped the chicken and it was where it should be. I have always been nervous about cooking chicken on the bone, but not anymore! Being able to preheat the fryer makes cooking even faster, which I love. I’m on an eat clean low carb diet so I cook EVERY meal in it. When I’m cooking my food I normally just keep it at the 350 degrees 15 minute temp/time because it cooks so fast. It has a shake reminder, which I find very handy. Roasted mushrooms, zoodles, jalapeños, I couldn’t even name all that I cook in there but it’s very convenient and everything tastes great! It even crisps up frozen eggplant slices I have vacuum sealed in the freezer. Chicken slices coated in almond or coconut four come out CRISP. When you register your fryer you get an extra 1 year warranty so a total of 2 years Cosori will stand behind their product. The recipe book has tons of recipes with pictures that I can’t wait to tweak and make them where I can eat them. Or I could just make them how the book says and feed the others in my family :) Very detailed instruction booklet and quick reference guide included. Oh, and all the buttons on the touch panel are easy touch so you don’t have to worry about holding down a button or trying to get it to set right when you’re in the middle of cooking.

I had a Habor that malfunctioned after 2 months. Bought a 400 dollar Breville Smart oven that malfunctioned on day one. i had it....but I wanted an air fryer because I didn't want to fire up the oven every time I wanted to oven fry 4 pieces of chicken. I caved and got the Cosori.PROS: Large capacity (5.8 qt) Small profile compared to others. Non stick seems more durable than others (my habor started chipping after a few uses and hand washing).  After having made fried chicken in other air fryers, THIS one reigns supreme. It achieves something that other air fryers couldn't do. Normally, 'crispy' fried chicken in an air fryer just describes the skin being rendered to a point where its like a shell on the chicken. Sure, its crunchy, but it lacks the texture of fried chicken. The cosori somehow manages to get those little 'bubbles' in the skin like real fried chicken. It has more of the texture of real fried chicken.CONS: How long will it last? My past experience with other brands doesn't give me confidence. Sure, Cosori gives you a 2 year warranty...but I would rather have something that lasts than something you need to trade in every now and then...keeping in mind that once the 2 years is up...no more trade ins.Only time will tell.If you want to slide the basket out to flip food, its probably best to pull it completely out, otherwise the electronic control panel gets a blast of hot steam, which can't be good. Maybe the panel is protected from this? I'm not going to chance it. If it's not protected from hot steam, its a design flaw.Update: While performance on this air fryer is great, the unit died after 13 months. Cosori sent me a new one... but said 'because its close to the end of warranty' they will send a new one, but this new one will not be covered. This product  is advertised as a TWO YEAR warranty. I appreciate them sending me a new fryer, but I think they need to read their own literature.You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with the performance of this air fryer...when it works.",Best Air Fryer performance.

Now the entire thing is starting to make a rattling noise when it runs for more than 15 or so minutes.  I don't have confidence that it is going to last all that long, when it is already making rattling noises and I haven't even had it two weeks.I want to keep and like it.

I put it by the area where it smells the strongest and it started registering abnormal levels of VOCs.  I don't know if this means anything, but it does show that the product's plastic is off-gassing something.  When I noticed the smell upon taking it out of the box yesterday, I promptly took it outside and left it in the fresh air all day.  That didn't make any difference at all.  It smelled just as bad when I brought it back inside.  It's unlikely that I am going to keep this and I don't see the point of replacing it a second time.

I smelled the entire appliance and the plastic smell is strongest at the bottom and top of the appliance.  The basket doesn't smell at all.  It makes me wonder if it is safe for me to be using it.

Also custom your meal setting.-Easy to clean!Con:-Inside might be wide, but  the basket is wasting some space when the pan under it is so much larger.-Poor height, this might be wide, but also short, can't or have hard time fitting a whole  large chicken. Small 3lb is good. I did got a 5lb fit, but need to push flat as possible for it to fit. It had about 1cm clearance from the heating element, which is not ideal and it came out dry. The 3lb was still juicy due to more clearance and space for the air to heat it.-So much plastic on the front cover, as it trap water inside after wash.-Because it traps water, after rinsing, when you cook again, there will be steam comes out under or inside the basket (some people have noted this as smoke, but is just steam).-Nasty smell, I don't know what it is, but after 10min of cooking there is a nasty smell, like plastic or non-stick coating. I really don't know what it is, but I would guess is the thick plastic from the front cover. It's still there after weeks of use! ( I also did washed before using it the first time!)-Pre-set options are awful! They always over cook and burn my food. (Unless you are cooking very large or fill whole basket full, don't use the pre-setting!)-The key/touch pad buttons as one of the worst I have use. It either reads your touch to much or don't at all, as other have stated. Mine so falr haven't fail yet.-No dehydrator option, even though it can do it. But since COSORI sells a dehydrator oven they left this option out, other Fryer in the market have this option handy. Final Thought:I only pick this cause it was on sale under $100, and it has smart wifi. The App is handy as it can control the unit if the touch pad does fail one day. Cooking food is great as long you don't use the pre-setting, like cooking frys and pre-cook chicken wings from the freezer does not need 25min, rather a 12min is done! and that's fast. My conventional counter oven would take 15-20min. Food comes out not as crunchy/crispy as some other Fryer I had used.I wish the height of the basket would be taller as another brand I had that was a 6qt was just enough to fit a whole small chicken even though it was only a little less wide as this.Finally the weird smell really kills this review. I just don't know why, I had used my friend's fryer another brand which doesn't have this issue, I really think they over used the cheap plastic cover that's causing it after it heats up, or I could be wrong. This Fryer is, really a ""heat dryer"" as it doesn't fry anything nor it will replace my counter Oven, because it just can't do large item or frozen bun, which best to steam. However, it does cook fast and can keep the juice in the meat, plus reducing the fat. Again it's great with meat and that's about it, everything else is just okay. It's also a bit pricey for something with so many cons, you can find way cheaper Air Fryer this size on sale if not for the smart wifi feature.  Even COSORI's other lower model which is the same size cheaper by 30%.Update 11/2020After months of use, the smell is still there, it has to do with the plastic, the smell is from the top of the unit, anytime I cook over 10min I can start to smell it. Won't find this toxic smell from my counter top oven. I have my windows open and fan on to escape the smell, if not I would of trashed this. Now I'm just waiting for this fryer to fail one day so I can get something else. Otherwise, it still cooks not to bad. They have so far a second firmware update,  don't know what they tried to improve on the unit, wish they would have a history log from app.","Buy this only for the Smart/wifi feature.

Heating unit up top to brown, hot air circulated within the chamber to heat.I used my oven fried chicken recipe and tried it in this Air Fryer. The chicken came out the same, aside from the fact I had to make it in 2 batches, due to space, as oppossed to one batch.Maybe it's because I already make my food in my large convection oven. The results are the same. Crispy on the outside; moist and tender in the middle. Little to no oil.As for french fries. I won't even try them. Fries you find in the freezer isle of your local grocer are unhealthy to begin with. Read the ingredients. Some of them require a degree in chemistry to understand what's in them. Plus, they are already laced with oil and sodium. Making them in the air fryer does not change their ingredients, or, in my opinion, make them healthier for you as opposed to making them in my convection oven. I now opt for fresh russets, toss with oil, and roasted on parchment paper in my oven.So, I guess it is just a matter of opinion. As for me, there is no such thing as ""air frying"". Trying to cut sodiuim, fat, and carbs, I'll continue with my tried and true tested methods used in my convection oven. Low oil, low to no sodium, roasted on parchment paper.

We had purchased a pressure cooker a while back and we don't really use it, even though it's a nice one.  In part, I think we're kind of creeped out by using a high pressure device, and that's no doubt just an ""us"" problem.So I read about these things and bought this Cosori 5.8 qt model with Alexa / WiFi connectivity, not that I think I'll ever use that connectivity, but for $10 more after a coupon, why not?  And we are a full Alexa house, so you never know.  It allows you to upload recipe parameters.So far we absolutely love this Cosori.  We've purchased a french fry slicer and made outstanding french fries.  We've made burgers in it - both frozen and from ground beef.  We've done the grilled ham and cheese and tuna melts, though these will take some experimenting with as the top can blow off of the sandwich or the bread can end up too dry (maybe MORE butter?).  My wife has done frozen fish in it.  We also bought the extra accessories and have even made pizzas from pre-made dough and we're getting ready to try premade crusts that don't have to be thawed.  We've also done the breakfast sandwiches.  It makes excellent bacon.  This is probably some of the best bacon we've made.The recipe book does have some minor issues, the one that I remember first and foremost is that if you get a pound of ground beef to make sliders, and this is what the recipe calls for - 1 pound of ground beef - the recipe then tells you to fashion it into 4 evenly formed patties.  But that's a 1/4 burger.  That's not a slider.  It makes about 8 sliders using my burger press with the slider piece, and they're GREAT.  We've encountered a couple other minor things in the recipe book, but if somebody as bad in the kitchen as me can figure those out, anybody can.  If only there was an easy mechanism to recommend corrections.Originally, I rated this as a 4 star due to what was definitely a defective control panel that made changing the temperature and time a serious hassle.  Amazon exchanged the unit and while the replace did have a periodic vibration, that appears to have gone away, hopefully for good?  The control panel on the new unit appears just fine.In addition to the extra accessories, I even went so far as to buy the Ramekins in two sizes for both eggs and deserts, basting brushes for spreading the olive oil nicely on the burgers, etc.  I just ordered additional pizza pans so we can have them stacked up and ready to use.  And that leads to the next thing.  If you're like me, you'll find that you actually enjoy using this thing so much, you'll want to use it as often as possible.  The problem is that, for example, making pizzas for three?  Well, you can only do one at a time.  Same deal when making an 8-pack of ready to bake biscuits.  You can only do 4 at a shot.  We've jokingly tossed around the idea of purchasing a second unit, or maybe a bigger one?  We'll have to see.  I will tell you this - I'm horrible in the kitchen and this thing is actually making me look like I'm talented at preparing food.","Upgrading it to a 5, since it's exchange...",Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,26 people found this helpful,203,56,Public,186046.0

I didn't have a sprayer so I used paper towels to dab olive oil lightly and Old Bay seasoning. There wasn't a recipe or temp and cook time so I did a search online. I did preheat of 390 and cooked at 390 for 2 mins each side. Checked and did another minute. I should of used the preset fish instead of shrimp but I'm learning.They came out delicious.

It holds plenty, yet it has a low profile and fits under my kitchen cabinet.For those of you, like me, who were confused on what this appliance actually is; it’s really a counter-top convection oven. Not a “fryer”. It circulates hot air around your food. The result is nicely cooked veggies, seafood, etc. in a short amount of time. The veggies turn out great... similar to roasting but it takes a lot less time. Just toss your what you’re cooking lightly in olive oil and the machine does the rest.It’s also very easy to clean.  The only thing I would improve is the release button on the basket... it’s a little tricky at first to get the hang of... but after a few surprise drops, I’m now trained to make sure it’s resting a counter before releasing the basket.

Overall I'm very pleased with the air fryer. I use it almost daily. I've made chicken, corn, eggplant, fries (of course), spaghetti squash, meat balls and more and everything comes out amazing, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. There are however a few design flaws that need to be addressed by the company. One is major. The screws in both baskets become loose after almost every use and I constantly have to tighten them. I discovered this when I found one of the screws in my food! The other issue, is that the material of the inner basket (with the holes), is different than the material of the drip basket. The drip basket is a non-stick material that is very easy to clean. The basket with the holes (roasting basket thing) does not appear to be. The first few times of use, it was easy to clean and with each subsequent  use, it becomes more and more difficult. I use a variety of cooking sprays when using the fryer and eventually the basket ends up with a sticky, oily residue that is impossible to remove unless you use an abrasive scouring tool, which would obviously ruin the basket, so I haven't done that and try to ignore the fact that I'm cooking in a pan that is less than clean. Just FYI, I clean both baskets after each use. I hope you find this helpful.","I love it, but there is a major design flaw that needs to be fixed.",Color: Burgundy RedSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,16 people found this helpful,206,77,Public,

All three were excellent.  But, they were BIG.  I’m so in love with this Cosori and can rest easy that I made the right choice in selecting this air fryer as the one I’m sticking with.  One of the main reasons I love it so much is the size – so much smaller than most on the market (look at picture of it next to my Blendtec blender), but had just as much capacity in the basket!  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.  It’s the best looking one on the market – and we know how important THAT is!  The programmable keep warm function is awesome and when it comes to cooking it performs amazingly well.  Clean up is an absolute breeze.  Last night I cooked a whole chicken and the drawer wiped clean with a paper towel and almost no effort.  Nothing stuck to the great nonstick finish.  While the chicken rested, I roasted asparagus in 6 minutes, then garlic toast in 3!  The chicken was so delicious, it almost brought tears to my eyes!  Fall off the bone tender, juicy, and parts of the skin as crispy and delicious as any pork cracklin’ (chicharrón) I’ve ever tasted.  Thank you, Cosori, for making such an awesome appliance.  Not to bore you with yet more praise, but about 6 months ago, I purchased the wildly popular Instant Pot pressure cooker.  I absolutely love my Instant Pot – was cooking dinner in it almost every night.  Until I got my Cosori Air Fryer.  I’ve only used the Instant Pot once since then.  If you knew how much I love to cook, and how enamored I was (and am) with the Instant Pot, you’d know what a big deal that is!  Another small thing I like about the Cosori is that the corners of the basket are not quite as rounded, a little more ""squared off"", which makes it a little more spacious.  OH - like I said, over the years, I've owned/used now four air fryers - all top quality.  Of the four, I've only been contacted by ONE manufacturer - COSORI.  They emailed me and asked if I was happy with their product and if there was anything I needed or if I had any suggestions on how to improve the air fryer.  That's an example of exceptional customer service.  I was already completely sold on it, but if not, that would certainly have sealed the deal!!","Small on the outside, big capacity inside, best Air Fryer out there!!",Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,31 people found this helpful,,,,

PLEASE SEE END OF REVIEW FOR UPDATE.I want to love my Cosori air fryer.  I saw it used on a Youtube cooking channel, and so I figured, this must be a pretty mainstream product.  I got it seven months ago and it has become a mainstay in the kitchen, and all but replaced the toaster oven, the frying pan, and even the grill.The one problem I have is that the buttons, or whatever you call those little circles on the front panel, are very difficult to press, especially with damp fingers.  It just doesn't work. What's more, when I press them, they don't activate the function immediately; they seem to work only after my finger is lifted.  A kind of delayed reaction, in other words. I can't understand why they couldn't have used an old fashioned set of push buttons, or even a mechanical dial switch.  These technologies have been around for at least 100 years and are pretty well understood.I have tried and tried to figure out how to use the buttons but they are just persnickety and only work part of the time.  Extremely frustrating and that's why I knocked the rating down from 5 stars to 2.  I'm planning to finally contact them and ask whether I have a defective unit, and if they can somehow fix the problem, I'll be happy to alter this rating.Apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?As a cooking appliance, if you can get past the awful user interface, it's a great cooker.  It can cook 6-8 chicken drumsticks in 24 minutes and they come out absolutely delicious, juicy and tender, not raw in the middle, not burned on the outside.It makes toast reasonably well (though we don't make a lot of toast in this house).  It is great for reheating things.  It is wonderful for vegetables; one of our favorites is broccoli florets sprinkled with hoisin sauce and garlic -- just don't over cook or you get these nasty black bitter bits that are quite unappetizing.There are hundreds of videos out there demonstrating how to make just about anything in these gizmos.  I was an air fryer skeptic until I watched a few, then decided to take the plunge and get one, and now I'm sold... albeit, I wish I'd gotten one that was easier to use.They do make an app that allows you to control the air fryer from your phone.  It's what I would call a work in progress. The name of the app is ""VeSync"".  You run the app and it detects the Cosori as one of the appliances it can control.  That's fine for them, I suppose, but from the user's perspective, it would be so much better to have an app called ""Cosori"".  I have so many apps and it's impossible to remember that vesync means cosori.  Come on, who decided this was a great idea?Anyway, more on the app:  it sort of works well.  I say ""sort of"", because it promises more than it delivers.  There's a ""cooking history"" section (but no search function).  You can tap on a history item and it will start the Cosori for you, remotely; you can also alter the temp and cooking time.  Right now I can see last night's chicken, but it doesn't list this morning's pop tart from 15 minutes ago. WHY??? Maybe it takes a while to retrieve the data... I have no idea.  Just another annoyance.  The app does send you notifications when the cooker is done, if you choose to use that feature.I do like that you can add your own recipes to the app.  The thing is, it's not rocket science to use this fryer; just set time and temperature and go.  The saved recipe thing is mainly to help you not overcook or undercook, and that's a matter of trial and error.As far as cleaning and maintenance, it's pretty simple.  You pull out the basket and wash in warm soapy water.  If you're doing dry stuff like toast or reheating a bowl of soup, there's little or no cleaning.  If you're doing meat or wet veggies, you may need to do some cleaning.  I use a soft scratch sponge, but a brush also works well. It helps to soak the whole basket in warm soapy water for 20 minutes, and my wife has run the inner basket through the dishwasher a couple of times; that makes me nervous that it could damage the teflon coating, but so far it seems okay.The inner/outer basket design has plusses and minuses; you can lift the inner basket out, but if you're doing it one-handed (as one tends to do in kitchens) you need a surface under the outer basket or it will fall to the floor.  Not ideal; it would be nice if the outer basket could be retained in the machine somehow, maybe with a hook, so you don't have to position the air fryer 12"" in from the edge of the counter.Liquid seems to accumulate sometimes in the space under the outer basket, maybe just condensation.  It's probably not a bad idea to wipe that up from time to time, just to prevent rusting or messing up the heat cycle.In my opinion, this appliance is still a work-in-progress. They have some issues to solve regarding the buttons and basket design.  Air fryers in general are still a new thing, but they've become very popular for good reason; they work very well for what they do.  With a few tweaks, this can be an excellent product worthy of 5 stars.UPDATE June 25 2020After I wrote to Cosori, they generously shipped me a new unit.  I'm happy to report that the buttons work much better.  As a test, I wet my finger and it still works.  I will say, the buttons still have a kind of delayed reaction -- they don't really engage until you lift your finger, which is odd, but I have gotten used to it.  Most importantly, the buttons all respond immediately now, and I don't need to repeatedly press the time/temp button to activate it.  Thanks to Cosori for properly handling this issue and I've boosted my rating accordingly.",Review updated after my defective unit was replaced for free.,Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,19 people found this helpful,773,134,Public,49252.0

One day I was using it to cook up a few turkey burgers for the kids and out of nowhere, and in the middle of cooking, the basket released itself from the fryer, slid out onto the countertop and since I have granite countertops, it kept sliding right off that surface and crashed to the floor. Very random! I was thinking I’d done something wrong. This device has to be perfect right? I mean it wasn’t exactly cheap. I’d done my homework and got one of the top rated. Maybe I didn’t lock it into place all the way. So from that point, I’d made it my business to be sure to push it in all the way until I felt it lock. All was all good for about 3 weeks and then this afternoon, I was making lunch for me and hubby. I’d put in two Burgers and was preparing us a salad when 5 minutes into the cooking process, I heard the fan stop and I turned around quickly but I was too late, the basket popped out, slid onto the countertop and then crashed to the floor. But this time, hot splatter popped onto my foot and leg...OUCH! I wasn’t badly injured but I’m baffled!!! Literally baffled! This is obviously a flaw in the design that can be potentially dangerous. Imagine if my kid was in there??? Realistically, I love this fryer! I love the design, I love ease of use and ease of cleaning and I love the way the food tastes when it comes out. But that right there, that’s BAD! One other issue...there are about 5 small screws inside that loosen on their own so I find myself tightening them at least twice a week. And lastly, don’t ever and I mean EVER hit the button that releases the basket from the tray unless you are holding it over a countertop or something. I made that mistake and the entire tray dropped out and fell on my foot. It wasn’t hot but it hurt like hell!!!Update: I contacted Cosori directly after my blackened mahi ended up all over my kitchen floor. They need to be aware of this problem. At first I was quite offended that one of the reps told me, “We will look into this issue immediately. Meanwhile, take a moment to read your Cosori Air Fryer manual!” What???!!! So you mean to tell me there is a portion of the manual that mentions this malfunction??? Because I already read the manual and it was never mentioned! Anywho....they handled the situation for me and offered to replace my current air fryer and asked me to ship them the old one so that they could investigate this. So I’m feeling that this may not be a common problem as I’ve only found a few videos of people complaining about this same malfunction (which apparently becomes progressively worse). So as of today, a new fryer has been sent and is on the way.

French fried, carrot (root vegetables), meat, etc.- The cooking book and recipe manual are very helpful.- Clean-up is super easy - the metal is very non-stick as is the bottom pan that catches the drips- You can use a preset button to get an idea of recommended temperature and time but use the Time/Temp button to adjust it down- On the presets, it beeps half way through for you to ""shake"" the food which is helpful to see how cooked they are- I finally was able to make roasted brussel sprouts with a maple glaze that have not worked out in my normal oven- There was a plastic smell the first time I used it and a faint hint in the food, but now I do not notice it.

I’m not one to jump on the bandwagon of a new craze or product right away.  (Case in point, I bought my first toaster oven last year 😳 and have yet to purchase an Instapot).  My scenario for a kitchen appliance goes something like this...1) First and foremost, I have to be convinced that it’s something I will use... that will make my life easier.  Something that will make me want to kick myself in the posterior for not buying it sooner.2) Secondly, it’s got to look good (this is where the snob part comes in ;)  After all, if it’s going to take up precious real estate on my countertop, it better damn site look good.  No shiny plastic football shaped appliances for my kitchen, thank you.3) Third (and this is the most time consuming) I research it to death.  The pros, the cons, the ‘mehs’, YouTube videos, manufacturer websites, Facebook groups.  Yep, I read user reviews like they were Consumer Reports (confession... always starting with the 1-star 😬).So why do I suck all the joy out of making a spontaneous purchase you ask?  Because I’m at a point in my life where I’m tired of owning and storing things I rarely use (hello waffle iron, rice cooker, kitchen aide mixer, etc., etc., etc.)  Because I appreciate quality, utility, durability and attractiveness...throw in ‘good value / price’ and you’ve just checked all my buy boxes.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I am in the ‘you get what you pay for’ camp and have absolutely no problem buying top of the line.  However, if I can find a quality product at a good price, all the better.  So, how did the process go with Air Fryers?Air Fryer:Do I want it?  Yes.  Need it?  Truthfully, no.  Use it?  Probably.  Will it make my life easier?  Oh hell yes!  No more greasy cooktops to clean and that’s a huge plus in my book.  So, that’s a big YES for adding an air fryer to my kitchen appliances.  Here’s how Cosori did: Appearance -  Love the sleek design and classy brushed finish of the Cosori.  Can a kitchen appliance actually be described as beautiful?  Why yes, yes it can.  ;)Research / Design -  It seems that Cosori looked at all the complaints from different models of air fryers and designed their product addressing those complaints.  The top does not open so it fits on the countertop, under cabinets.  The footprint is relatively compact compared to some other models.  The basket is squarish with good capacity, by design accomodating more food than round baskets.  Large, easy to read display.  Digital presets including Preheat (Note:  Do NOT skip this step.  Despite what other manufacturers claim, preheating will definitely make a difference in many of your recipes).  Shake reminder.  Turns itself off when done.  Super easy to clean.  No problem with the basket’s non-stick finish flaking off.  Comes with a 2 year warranty.  Surprisingly nice cookbook included. Very responsive customer service.  Bottom line?  Quality product, 2 Year warranty.  So far, so good.Value / Price -  A big YES here.  The Cosori Air Fryer 5.8qt is $119.  The Phillips (my second choice) is $249+ depending on the model you select.Summary:  I’m sad to say I was unfamiliar with Cosori prior to my research of Air Fryers.  So although this is the first of their products I’ve owned, it likely won’t be my last.  If the Cosori Air Fryer is representative of the quality of their other products... I’m definitely a fan.  I use my Air Fryer 4-5 times a week and am very happy with the purchase.  Style, quality, value... Cosori has it all.  Highly recommended.Disclaimer:  I did NOT receive a free Cosori Air Fryer to try in exchange for my review....  Dang it.","Ok, I’ll admit it...

A few coworkers talked me into it so I decided to give it a shot.What I liked:I don’t think there’s anything prepared I did not like. Some of the best fresh fish I’ve ever had. This by far is the one thing that I can say may be worth the purchase alone.... Phenomenal! Potatoes, chicken, the crunch in asparagus and broccoli that I’ve never had before but could definitely get used to. Just a spritz of olive oil and seasoning. Just set and forget. Cook time is short and clean up is easy. Basket capacity is good enough to cook multiple items at a time.What I didn’t like:1.)Some may not consider this an issue but I can’t get over the smell. It’s overwhelming and can last for days.  It’s not a plastic smell that some complain about. That goes away in time. It’s a deep fryer smell that permeates through the house and lingers for days. An issue that others I’ve talked to don’t seem to have with their air fryers. Maybe better air filtration would benefit.2.) I found 2 of the screws in the bottom of the basket after a few uses. This actually didn’t bother me as much as #1.  Just a small phillips head and problem solved.3.)This contradicts one of the reasons I liked this model but...  It’s big. Make sure you have counter space to accommodate. Likely fine for most. Just takes up too much space for me personally.So in summary..I liked it , recommend it and most probably would agree.. but I have to return this one.",4 Stars But Its Just Not For Me,Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,15 people found this helpful,15,4,Public,5535750.0

I used the Cuisinart for a year before I decided to buy a dedicated air fryer.  The Cuisinart gave me a great learning experience but it was an awful chore to clean.  Also the heating element consisted of 3 ceramic rods at the top which didn't air fry the whole basket evenly.  I settled on the Cosori after a week of You Tube videos and internet research.  In the 2 days of owning the Cosori I've only been able to fry 2 items:, ie:  chicken wings and this morning - breakfast sausages.  I can tell you that I do not miss the Cuisinart at all.  Reasons for my liking the Cosori are:  Very easy to clean.  The exposed heating element seems to burn off any grease splatter before it hots the fan grid work.  The square pan allows more food in a single layer than a round pan.  The large heating element eliminates any hot/cold spots in the fry basket.  Much smaller footprint than the Cuisinart.  There is a learning curve.  The 2 items I fried were a little too well done for my liking.  The Cosori cooks much faster than the Cuisinart so I will adjust my recipes accordingly.  I am glad that I had a year's air fry experience.  I know how to correct recipe instructions for my liking.  The experience is sufficient to allow me to review the Cosori without prejudice.

I was so excited to try it.  But then it arrived.  Here are the pros and cons, for me:Cons:1. The size. It's monstrously HUGE.  And because of all the safety space precautions, you can't just use it on a regular counter.  It would be too close to the wall, and/or too close to the cabinets above it.  And don't ignore those precautions, I've seen multiple reviews of air fryers burning or melting walls and other things.2. Cleaning. It's a pain to clean.  The baskets are also huge, awkward to wash, and awkward to dry.3. The cord.  The booklet says they purposely made the cord short, because excess cord could be a safety hazard.  But since it can't be used close to the wall, etc, you have to use an extension cord with it - how is that any safer?4. The release button for the baskets.  I keep my nails relatively short because I enjoy using mechanical keyboards; but even so, I had a hard time using the release button.5. Aesthetics.  I realize this won't matter to a lot of people, but personally I think an appliance that resembles a pregnant stormtrooper from the Death Star doesn't belong in my kitchen.6. The food. I followed every instruction carefully.  I did the suggested test runs.  And the food came out not crispy AT ALL.Pros:None that I could find.

We have used it alone, (just the two of us) to make Mustard Chicken skewers (amazingly yum), 'fried' sweet potato fries, regular potato fries, and now that our kids  are home (from college/Covid) they have used it to make 'spicy carrot chips' and 'fried tofu' (daughter 'says' she's now a vegetarian, whatchagonnadoo?)- but I'll admit, those things DID taste good, and no fuss, no mess, NO OIL. Not once.This summer we plan to use it at least two to three times a week, to help free up space in a kitchen with only one stove/cooktop unit... and too many cooks! Clean-up takes all of a minute with soapy water, paper liners that absorb most of the oil; the unit itself heats up quickly, runs as it's supposed to do,  and is relatively quiet. It's effective, and looks fantastic on our counter next to our single-cup Coffee maker (Daughter is hogging that, every morning, too- LOL) and the cookbook that came with it, will give us enough recipes for months to come, as we work on our 'slow and gentle' learning curve.

I  am fairly new  to air fryers.  I  had a 2 quart air fryer for a couple months and it seemed a bit small even for just my wife and I.  My wife saw the Cosori air fryer and thought it looked good and was worth looking at.  I saw that there was a WIFI  version.  This looked interesting to me because it was advertised as  being available to operate by my iPhone.I am blind and usually do not find many appliances that are accessible for me to operate.  With a little help to connect the air fryer to the vesync app, I was able to operate  all the functions described in the product description using my iPhone.I tried a couple functions like preheat, delayed start, manual cooking, and preset for vegetables.  It all worked without a  flaw.  Pretty incredible!  I  ended up cooking a couple batches of asparagus.  They were just as good as if I had made them in the oven.  Probably a little better.  I was notified, when using the preset,  to pull out the basket for a little shake.  The  vesync app also let me know the current temp  and time remaining for cooking, with an option to pause or stop cooking.In the app there is a section for recipes along with a history of what settings I have used for cooking with corresponding dates.As I said I have not much experience with air fryers, so I cannot say this is better or worse than others.  I can say that this is the only air fryer that I have found that is totally accessible for a person who is blind.  I cannot overstate how unusual and impressive the accessible capabilities are for this air fryer.I wanted to add one more comment:  When the new version of the iPhone IOS 13 came out, the vesync app did not work for using the air fryer with my iPhone and the VoiceOver screen reader.  I notified vesync.  They were on it.  Within 2 weeks they had made the needed corrections to their app and now I am back up and running.  Wow!  that is customer support.  I will be a life-long customer of the Cosori and vesync products.  If I could give this product a 10 I'd do it.  Thanks so much.btw many times when I contact an app developer about using their app with VoiceOver, they just say too bad for you.

I decide to go a little bit larger capacity and upgrade a little bit too. For me personally, the basket that lifts out of the pan with a handle like a deep fryer was a must. I readreviews on air fryers for 3 days driving myself crazy! Every time I thought… Yes! This is the one! I would see a 1 or 2 reviews saying it was a nightmare, and I got cold feet.I never write reviews. Thought it was a waste of time. My theory is that most people typically don’t write a review if they are satisfied. They only go to the reviews to vent because they are mad… so a lot of times, I feel like reviews on anything might skew on the bad side due to that. I finally settled on this one and ordered it. I found it on one of those sites where people use 10 or so things and then rank them. I saw some bad reviews on Amazon about the steam escaping and puddling on the counter. That sites review didn’t have that issue. I also saw some people saying it smells like burnt plastic even after using it for months. Some saying it was DOA and some had it die after a few weeks. Some said the touch pad didn’t work great.Well I’ve had it for a good while now and used it a LOT, so that covers longevity issues. I have had none of those issues or any at all to this point. We love it. We got the red one and it’s really nice looking. It’s solid and doesn’t feel cheap. The non stick coating seems much better than what I’m used to. The keypad works good and the preset times are spot on. The preheat button is really convenient. I love that it has an alarm midway through reminding you to shake food. The basket that is a square with the corners rounded is probably one of my favorite changes than my previous fryer which was round. Comes in handy when heating up stuff like pizza. We bought a pump up pressurized olive oil mist sprayer and after a light mist of oil on fries, they come out as close to deep fried as you can get, but aren’t soaked in oil grease!I don’t know if I got lucky, or if people weren’t using it properly, but this is one of the best cooking appliances I’ve ever used.I realize I wrote too much.

I sent my first one back thinking I must have had a defective unit.First-  The screws in the basket WILL fall out frequently.  They will fall into your food.  You will need to check and tighten them frequently or you risk choking on the screws.  I'm not sure how they can even continue to sell this like with this problem.  The screws on the outer portion (the basket holder) will come out too but not as frequently.Second-The timer resets everytime you 'shake'.  Those who have air fryers know you are to pull out the tray and shake it around while cooking to maximize air flow and crispiness.  Air fryers will continue right where you left off when you put the basket back in-that's one of air fryers biggest conveniences.  The problem with this one is it resets back to a full minute each time you do that.  For example, say you are cooking something for 15 minutes and you 'shake' 5 times.  If you pull the basket out and there's 12:02 left when you put it back in it starts back at 12:59 seconds.  After 5 times you might be adding around 4-5 minutes extra cooking time.Third-The least of the problems but still a problem.  The buttons are really weird on the front and you have to almost press through the panel to get them to work.  It was worse on my first one.Other than the big problems the air fryer is awesome.

I’m not new to new appliances and they all come with a “smell”. It’s all because of packaging, residue, what have you. These are the steps I took to avoid having this issue and was able to use my air fryer right away after taking these steps with 0 plastic smell:Pre step (optional): I wiped down each surface with a Clorox wipe just to disinfect but also the alcohol breaks down the residues better/quicker. You don’t have to do this, it’s just what I do.Step 1: wash with a sponge with the non abrasive side (of its a double sided sponge). Just like during Covid with washing your hands, wash for at least 30 seconds well on all of the surfaces of the basket.Do this with the baskets. Also, since I wiped the inside with a Clorox wipe, I took a damp paper towel and wiped the inside again to wipe that out.Step 2: follow the instructions in the booklet for “test it out”. After each time you heat up the unit, carefully remove the basket and separate it, and repeat step 1.  I would suggest using a dish brush with a longer handle though so you don’t burn yourself. ** after u wash it make sure you dry it best you can too.Step 3: Heat the unit again like the instructions say, and then wash and dry again. Preheat one more time than the instructions say, wash and dry again. (Total of 3-4 heat and wash/dry cycles)After taking these steps, I was able to preheat my air fryer, and successfully make chicken parm with no plastic smells or tastes.Reading and taking the time to thoroughly clean your product goes a long way.

I went on and ordered a replacement, I guess things happen. Just a bit of disappointing if it is new? the face seemed it had hairlines swirls, not sure if it was a return. All looked new. Will update once I get a working unit.********UPDATE********Ok, I received my replacement order Monday, Thank you Amazon! This is a night and day product compared to what I received before. First, the difference in delivered product. First, the external box was an ""Amazon"" badged box and smaller over all. 2nd, the box inside was a ""Cosori"" labeled box compared to what I had before (Leit or something like that). Third, the box inside the Cosori box was the actual box of the product (with all the pics of it). Lastly the big difference was the fact that the basket had tape holding the basket as many ""new"" products are done. All looked great, plus no Swirls on the face. A new product indeed. I have a feeling the first was a return. Not cool.Now for the product review.. Yesterday, I went crazy and cooked Battered frozen strips for kids and they were Crispy using the frozen option. Wow!  Also, cooked fresh cut fries came out awesome. I think I cut them to thin, but the bigger ones were crispy and no oil (except for olive oil per instructions). Lastly last night, a NY and it was perfectly cooked, a nice Med Rare, it was great. Today, was another test. My daughter and I, mostly her cooked the Jalapeño popper from recipe book. They were great, only think I would of added to recipe was cream cheese, but followed directions for first time. Lastly, I cooked two giant chicken breast. I cooked then at 360 per online instructions, but I think the chicken preset would of done it just fine. Flipped them twice. Perfectly cooked at about 25-30 min.at 360. The president et is for 390 for 25.Wish I took pics, but let me tell you, this Air fryer is awesome. Don't doubt yourself in purchasing. You will be happy with results. I research and went with this brand, plus you sign up for warranty they give you an extra year for free. Cant beat that deal! You have nothing to lose, except the oil much to gain with good cooking!Go for it!  The one star less was from the beginning ordeal.

Air fryer with a wind up timer. It has worked perfectly all of this time and I absolutely love it and have used it daily all the time I've owned it. But after discovering the joys of owning and using an air fryer, (which is really a mini convection oven) I wanted more capacity and a digital interface. This Cosori fits the bill perfectly at a great price. If you are new to air fryers and cooking in one, there are things you need to know before you begin. First, after carefully unpacking it and removing any plastics, cardboard, paper, Styrofoam from both inside, and outside of the unit.. before ever plugging it in! Wash the basket and holder in gentle dish detergent and use a very soft cloth such as a microfiber or similar to protect the non stick coating. Let it dry and the next step is very important. All of these machines have factory residues and oils on them and in them that needs to be removed before you actually use it to cook with. You want to do this in well ventilated area because it possibly smoke and it will smell awful, much like plastic and oil. To remove this residue, move the machine to a well vented area or under a range hood that exhausts the fumes outside of your home. This unit has a preheat feature that runs at 400 degrees for 5 minutes. Simply run it once, and then again once more. The residue from the factory will be gone and your food will taste and smell great. The next thing you want to do is register your new product at the Cosori website and you will receive an extra whole year on your warranty! I have included a picture of the sleeve that is included with the product, it takes you directly to the website to register 😉. Also never ever ever use non stick sprays like pam in these machines. It damages the non stick over time and ruins it! Fatty meats and foods need no oils, anything that does, just simply use the cooking oil of your choice, such as avocado, olive, canola etc. You can apply it to the basket with a paper towel or a hand sprayer. You need very little. Just enough for a little flavor browning and crisping and to help seasoning stick to the food. The presets are a starting point, but you will have to experiment to find what Temps and times work for you. If you are using frozen foods usually the cook time and Temps will be a lot less because these machines cook faster and more efficiently. I recommend dropping the stated temp 20-25 degrees and shortening the cook time by about 10 minutes as a starting point. You can always add more time or adjust the temp as you go and get more familiar with it. One more tip: always allow the fryer basket and drip tray to completley cool off before putting them in water to clean or soak it. If you put them in water hot, you can damage the nonstick coating! So far, this new machine has worked flawlessly and is giving me fantastic results. I will update this review after I have owned it longer and will tell of any issues that may arise.

So first the disclaimer... this review is for the parents because well that's me.What I love:The wifi connection with the app- when I saw this feature my first thought was who would need this much gadgetry come on. But then there's the fact you can preheat it before u get home so it's ready or I can start it and walk away and get alerts that hey I have something cooking. You don't think it's a big thing but once you use it your like man I wish every appliance reminded me I was doing something.The basket-some reviews complained about the plastic piece and feeling flimsy or that the basket came apart too easy. That clear plastic piece covers a button. You have to slide that piece all the way up which can only be done when you have the basket out. Then you have to push the button all the way down and that releases the basket which you still have to pull out. Again that's my experience... I know things happen but that's how I worked for me. Plus the thing is huge. I easily feed my family of 3 or 4 when friends are over.The food-there is a learning curve with already prepared food like chicken nuggets or French fries from a bag. Yes I cook that stuff because I have kids and am comparable to their favorite restaurants now with this thing! I have learned to cut the cooking time in half and that's pretty accurate. The app has a ton of recipes too that are super easy for parents and not too gourmet. I do cook things that aren't in a bag and they come out amazing.I read reviews for this item and about 20 other ones. This one looked good on paper but then some of the reviews gave me concerns so I waited a month to purchase it. I'm sure there are flukes and things go wrong but for my experience it was as good as it is on paper. From a single mom point of view who has very little free time...

This has happened several times, and the main reason we're getting rid of it - it's blown out fuses on its own and when other appliances are on the same circuit; our wiring is pretty sturdy, so it's disturbing.It's falling apart. From the beginning the basket and the basket tray sorta rattled a bit, and what they've been doing over time is undoing the screws. We tightened it but one went missing (maybe in the dishwasher?) and there's two holding on for dear life; we're constantly having to tighten it. It seems to simply be a side effect of how its built.The tray sometimes rattles itself out of place and stops cooking - the tray sometimes rattles itself out and will stop the cooking process; probably a bit of operator error, howeverI would have definitely given this machine 5 stars when I first got it, but it unfortunately hasn't held up very well.","Great Airfryer in function, but not very well made.",Color: Burgundy RedSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,22,7,Public,16302652.0

At first, I wondered if Air Fryers were worth the hype, and I can attest to the fact that they are. I loved this thing for the first couple months, recommended it to friends who went and bought it too. Now, as much as I want to be loyal and keep the brand, find myself worried about longevity.I don't know if I would consider this air fryer to be expensive, because with as much as we use it, it is worth every penny and is about the price of a mid-range microwave. But it was a purchase I didn't have a lot of excess money for and I was bummed it hasn't lasted six months. It doesn't appear cheaply made so I wonder if I have a lemon or something.So let me jump into the issues I have after many, many uses. The worst is that the air fryer drawer pops open sometimes while cooking... almost shoots out a foot or more, clear out of the fryer itself. It had issues remaining shut previously, with steam coming out the bottom sides. I remedied that by firmly pushing it back in again and it typically ""sealed"" up. Now it just pops completely out of the unit onto the counter.Up until that point, the only thing I disliked is the touch screen interface it uses for programming time, temperature etc. It is finicky and doesn't always register a finger-press... sometimes pressing more than a few times to get it to register. Sometimes it will not register prints at all.So, I'm unsure if I got the lemon of the bunch, and I really want to love this air fryer.

This air fryer actually hold its own in terms of size, and functionality, for reference you can fit a whole small chicken or 5 large chicken legs with no issues, and the pre sets are on point with the cooking time. Food cooks pretty fast, within 20 minutes you can get a few things done, Such as roasted potatoes and some fried/roasted chicken. Totally time efficient.Cons, the only issue I have with this air fryer is that the heat tends to flow more on a specific side, so food that tends to settle on the ""weak spot"" usually end up unevenly cooked, not horribly uncooked however, ive had an easy time fixing that by just shaking the basket and setting up 5 extra minutes to cook. I do like that the air fryer will tell you on the screen at some point to ""shake the basket"", it will almost always tell you this, so that you can redistribute the food evenly. Especially important if you're cooking things like French fries/loose foods. Another con would be the material for the basket.... it seems to be teflon or some sort of cheap non stick material which are usually not that great for our health so id caution everyone to NEVER scrub the basket and simply just use a soft sponge to avoid the material from scraping off over time.All in all, the air fryer is doing an amazing job. I havemt used my stove in over a week because I've been roasting all my food on this. However, if you're looking for something to bake a large cake, casserole etc. Then this is not it, its simply too small for larger dishes or a big family. A 8 to 10Q air fryer or convection oven might be more ideal. The air fryer also looks nice on the kitchen and doesn't take too much space. The noise isn't too bad either. It won't replace your stove altogether, but it makes an amazing addition for smaller 'side dishes' that would otherwise take forever to make on a normal oven or stoveBelow for reference are some photos of a medium and mini loaf pans you can fit in the basket:Both Mini pan dimensions: 5²³/32 in.

I like the square basket-I think it fits food better. I was able to easily fit 6 chicken tenders with room for at least 2-3 more. Cleaning the basket (and the base that the basket rests in) has been very easy, but I do use a soft-bristle kitchen brush on a long handle to get into all the openings in the basket. The air fryer is big and does take up counter space, but it’s not heavy to move around. I keep it on my rolling kitchen cart and move it to my counter to use it. I do rest it on a large, wooden cutting board when using just in case the bottom gets warm. The instructions are easy to understand, and using the control panel is fairly intuitive. I haven’t used the pre-settings. I prefer to set my own temperature and time. The vent in the back releases hot air when in use. I was able to put my hand about two inches from the vent without difficulty. Still, I give about 5” of space on all sides just to be safe. I didn’t find it too loud. I mean, it circulates hot air with a fan so there’s going to be some noise, but It didn’t annoy me.So far I’ve made French fries with russet potatoes, a chocolate cake (see photo) and chicken tenders (homemade, not frozen. See photo). All three items turned out delicious. The cake was divine-especially the second day (I have no idea why). The chicken tenders were crunchy on the outside and not the least bit dry on the inside. The fries would have been over-cooked had I left them in for the full amount of time the recipe called for. They were crisp on the outside. The cake recipe stated 30 minutes at 330 degrees. My attempt took 55 minutes at 330 degrees. I wasn’t surprised by this. I thought 30 minutes seemed too short. My advice is, check your food often at first to get a feel for the fryer. This is really no different than getting used to a new oven or other cooking appliance. You need to play around with times and temperatures a bit. Also, get a good air fryer cookbook or some highly-rated recipes online.Pros:-Easy to use, intuitive-easy clean up-keeps kitchen cool in summer-don’t have to heat up your oven for a small amount of food-1 to 2 minutes to preheat or no preheating for some recipes-Large basket, and square shape seems to fit food very well-basket has a safety feature so you won’t accidentally release it from the base it sits in-much healthier than deep fried foods, but you can still get that crispy crunchinessCons:-It’s large. You will lose counter space unless you can store it somewhere and take it out when needed.-if you are cooking for a large group, you’re going to be cooking in batches. The basket size works fine for our family of three with two light eaters, but even one more person at the table would have me cooking in batches.-If your looking for something to give you the same, exact taste as genuine fried food, this isn’t for you. It’s not an actual fryer. The name is deceiving. It’s really a countertop convection oven. The recipes use minimal oil (1 Tbsp for the fries I made and several sprays of olive oil on the chicken tenders with an olive oil spritzer).I would recommend this model so far without hesitation, but it’s only been one week and three recipes. If anything changes, I’ll update my review.

We have had ours for the less than a month and use it almost daily while we try out new recipes.The iPhone app connects with the Cosori Smart WIFi air fryer.  You can select a recipe illustrated in the app or you can manually set the time and temperature and start cooking.  The app updates you on the progress of the cooking -- how many minutes are left, when to shake, when cooking is done.If the air fryer did not have the WiFi feature, I would have returned the air fryer because the buttons for manually changing cooking time and temperature on the fryer are difficult to use.  The time and temperature buttons on  don't always register when you push them.  This is NOT a problem if you have a smart phone and purchase the WiFi enabled air fryer.I have recommended this air fryer to several family members.",There is a problem!

I wanted white,  and I found out that not all brands have white as a choice,...which is a shame because many people would prefer white in their all-white kitchens.  Even the top (expensive!) Phillips does not sell their digital XXL version in white.  (only the analog XXL- I called them)Reasons why I chose Cosori:1. White was a choice, and I like the way it looks.  Some brands are just too gaudy looking for me and I wouldn't want to leave them out in my kitchen.2. I liked that it doesn't keep cooking when the drawer is pulled out, and that the count-down time pauses too. Some brands (including the Phillips) don't pause when the drawer is pulled out.3.

(anything smaller would be too small in my opinion,...even for one person!)Upon setup and after washing,  I placed the Cosori on a cutting board, on top of my stove under my kitchen vent-hood and set the temp on 400 for 30 minutes.  I had the fan on but yes we could smell the stuff burning off.  After the first session, I let the air fryer cool down and then repeated once again for good measure.  After that,  there was no smell.I've been using the Cosori for the past three weeks, sometimes several times a day.  I will say that air frying is somewhat of a learning curve,  but if you know how to cook in the first place it doesn't take long to get into the swing of it.  I have had some great results!  It's fun to try new things and experiment.  One of our favorite things that I've made thus far is Salmon.  THE BEST!  I will share my recipe below.For two people, we get a one-pound, skin-on, center-cut piece of Whole Food's farm-raised. ($9.99 per lb always)  I cut the thinner belly meat off of that to save for breakfast,  and then I cut the big piece into two pieces.Dry salmon with paper towels.Pre-heat Cosori to 400Salt and pepper all sides of salmon except for the skin side.Mix together well:1Tablespoon honey1 Tablespoon mustard (I use spicy brown)1 Tablespoon melted butter (I use ghee)pinch of salt-Sometimes I shake a little garlic powder in with the honey, mustard, and butter-Place salmon pieces in basket (either lined with a little foil or not)Spread the honey-mustard mixture over the top of the salmon pieces.Set the machine for 12-13 minutes and that's it. (no turning) The time it takes will be determined by the thickness of the salmon. I look for the albumin to start to form (the white stuff) and then I know that it's done.  So far mine seems to be done in about 12 minutes, but they are fairly thick pieces.  Start checking at about 10.  Serve with lemon wedges. It is absolutely delicious and my husband who is not a salmon lover says it's the best salmon he's ever eaten.Cleanup:Cleanup has been a breeze.  I just soak the basket inside of the bucket in hot soapy water for a few minutes and everything comes off easily.*I haven't experienced any smoking at all yet.You can't go wrong with the Cosori air fryer.  I bought another one to gift to my daughter. Recommended!UPDATE June 2021: I bought this in August 2020.  I can no longer adjust temperatures when I'm in the pre-sets. It hasn't even been one year.  Also,  I have to keep screwing the handle onto the basket.",Three weeks in and loving it!

We ordered this online and used it first for some fried chicken.  it was delicious, but it behaved a little strangely - would suddenly cut out for a few seconds, and then come back on.  I thought that's weird, but maybe that's what it's supposed to do?  Anyway, it got worse and eventually stopped working after the 4th or 5th use.  By this time it was too late to return to Amazon so I contacted customer support via their website chat.Within about 10 minutes we had a new one on the way, no charge, no return required, and 4 days later we received the properly functioning we have now.

Here is what we have found in our first week of use of this COSORIAir Fryer Max XL 5.8 quart:Pros:A. Nice design in general,  clean features.B. Lots of manuals and directions on how to set it up.  Make sure you remove the foam insert as well as the cardboard inserts and ALL the tapes before you plug it in and use it for the first time.  Triple check if necessary.  There are many inserts of different kinds in this air fryer for shipping purposes.C. Nice recipe book.D. Two year warranty if you register on the COSORI website (see insert in box).  Lots of info required including the batch number which is by the way on the bottom of the air fryer (you will have to till it over) . It is written sideways next to the tag at the bottom.Cons:1. This COSORI air fryer model is in general sturdily built except for the clear plastic slider on the front handle that allows the cooking chamber to be slid out.  Please see attached picture.  This plastic slider is flimsy, jiggles and will not last long.  I cannot understand why COSORI would build what looks like a nice air fryer and then insert such a flimsy slider on its handle. You will have to buy a whole chamber container when this slider snaps off--as it will.2.  COSORI does not provide any accessories. You will have to spend another $30 to buy necessary accessories.3.  Cleaning is a pain because again you will have to slide the above mentioned plastic slider out of the way to press a button to release the cooking chamber so that you can clean the bottom part UNLESS you buy parchment liners which again is another $7 to 12 expense.4. COSORI doesn't provide you with any sample parchment liner which would help keep the air fryer clean.  So you will have to figure out exactly what size parchment liner paper to buy from Amazon.  For our 5.8 quart air fryer, an 8.5 inch Square is what will work.  I found that out after searching the internet.

I love the taste of the foods, the crispiness, and the ease of cooking in this machine. However, the smell of burning plastic or chemicals does NOT go away, we have used it many many times in hopes that it would. It's not as bad about halfway through the cooking because you start to smell the food, but the preheating and beginning of cooking is almost unbearable. My husband who isn't usually bothered by stuff like this, gets nauseous from the smell because it's so bad, and I have to leave all the windows open when cooking. I'm concerned what this smell could be, and how harmful it is that my children and I are breathing it in. Because of this, I don't ever really want to use it anymore! Also, it's a nightmare to clean when you make anything greasy in it, like fried chicken, or any kind of meat. The fat and grease have too many crevices to go in the inner container and you really have to scrub those out well, which is difficult. The bottom portion is easy to clean, but the one with the holes and slots is not. Also, there is no real easy way to clean the area inside the machine that all the grease is splattering on - the heating coils! I try to get up there with a wet towel to try to clean the grease off, but there are so many areas I can't reach and what comes off on the napkin is disgusting. I don't know if all air fryers are like this, but there should be an easier way to clean these things, but the deal breaker is mainly the burning plastic smell. It's just too powerful and potent, I just can't imagine that's not absolutely toxic for all of us.","Burning Plastic smell doesn't go away, difficult to clean",Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,,,,

I hated it immediately but was too lazy to send it back. I’ll replace it eventually.The setting “buttons” don’t work 75%+ of the times they’re pressed. Then, because you’ve pressed it 20 times rapid fire to get it to move 5 minutes, it starts skipping digits which would be helpful if the buttons actually worked. But they don’t.What’s more frustrating is that the power button is right beneath the button you have to press if you want to switch from degrees to time… something you have to press twice for every cook. The amount of times I have accidentally powered it off amidst the frustration of having to press the button so many times is unreal. Granted, that’s my fault technically, but of course the settings are reset when it powers off and I have to do it all over again.The smartphone app is virtually just an alternative to the aforementioned settings. You can’t start the device with the app. I’m sure there are uses for it, but for me it is completely useless other than the alert when it’s done.Alexa never works well with it.

Seeing reviews for COSORI and price difference between a new Philips XL, we purchased the COSORI.  So this review is between our experience with the Philips XL & the COSORI.1)  COSORI emits a chemical smell.  Washed the interior unit before use and after every use, however the chemical smell is getting stronger.  Have it stored in our kitchen utility cabinet and every time we open the cabinet we can smell the chemicals and it gets worse when cooking with it.2)  Instructions say to press preheat button first, before selecting what temperature and time you want to cook something.  So it's a 2 step process that requires monitoring.  The preheat button counts down from 5 minutes, then the unit shuts off.  So we are expected to press the preheat, watch it for 5 minutes and when it's done, select the temperature and cooking time for what we want to cook.  This is cumbersome !  Prefer the Philips where we select cooking temperature and time and it will beep when unit hits our desired temperature and maintain that temperature ready for us to put our food in anytime.4)  COSORI is bulky to handle when giving food contents a shake during cooking cycle:  - the entire bottom unit has to be shaken, not ""just the basket""  - the unit shuts off every time the cooking department is pulled out so heat is not just lost by pulling the tray out to check on the food or give it a shake, but more heat is lost because unit shuts off  and must be manually started again.5)  maybe it's the unit shutting off every time the basket is pulled out to check or stir the food that causes COSORI unit does not even come close to cooking food as evenly as the Philips XLFor all the above reasons, after two weeks of using the COSORI, we dumped it and replaced it with Philips XXL so we are happy again; sure it's double the price but quadruple the quality!  We are no longer worried about chemicals in our food and have to endure bad chemicals smells in kitchen from the COSORI.  We are writing the manufacturer with our complaint - no one should feel comfortable with a unit that emits strong chemical smells.  As for the user experience in the cooking process, it takes the fun out of air frying.","Literally ""stinks"" & cumbersome too",Color: Burgundy RedSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,929,89,Public,49881.0

The basket get pretty hot which is to be expected.  I have silicone gloves and silicone mitts but silicone pinch mitts would have been very useful.  Cleaning is simple but takes a bit of time.  Advice tip is to clean the inside of your Cosori each and every time that way you don't get things splattered and baked solid, you don't to have to do a deep cleaning.I wish Cosori had a kit with things you needed.  I'd be happy to buy it separately or added to the Air Fryer for a higher price.  When shaking the basket you will loosen the handle (at least that is what I've read online).  I've been shaking with the handle with my right hand and using a silicone glove grasping the basket.  Be careful about buying substandard gloves because they will only protect your hands for seconds.  Advice tip silicone gloves can be used in the Air Fryer, oven and cleaning the ice/snow off your car.  I'm looking for a small heat resistant spatula (like the George Foreman Grill type)  and a heat resistant tongs.  You probably have metal tongs in your kitchen but you don't want to scratch the nonstick coating so you want nonmetal tongs.  If Cosori sold their own branded utensils for the Air Fryer I'd buy from them with confidence.  I've been looking at various utensils for my Cosori and the reviews aren't so good, I don't want melting utensils.I'd happy purchase another Cosori Air Fryer as a gift because it is cool on the outside and seems to be made very well.  I've read online that they respect their customers and respond promptly about problems or replacement parts.  Same thing is said on Youtube videos.  Cosori gives you at 1 year warranty but bumps it upto 2 year if you do your product registration in something like two weeks (I think it is two weeks).  Get the extra protection for free.  I haven't actually contacted Cosori because I've have zero problems but it is nice to know that they stand behind their product.A problem that is confounding many customers is how to open the dang Air Fryer.  I couldn't find the answer in the instructions.You want to push the button down with your right thumb (and push right thumb forwards at the same time).  At the same precise time you want to pull your right hand back.  It opens easily but it can be a bit confusing at first.There are plenty of Youtube videos showing how to use the Cosori and I think if you have any questions fellow Youtuber or the cook who posted them will answer your questions.Oh yeah you can buy smaller and it will cook faster which might be better if you are single and want smaller servings. The Cosori seems to be the perfect size, not to small but not too big.  I'm happy with the basket size.This is my first Air Fryer so I can't speak with much experience.  Other Air Fryers brands might be just as good, I don't know.  All I know is that my Cosori has been running like a champ.",Great for quickly cooking.,Color: Creamy WhiteSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,36,24,Public,1145305.0

I am loving air frying and looking for ways to convert some of my old recipes to air frying.The produce is well constructed, sturdy, and easy to use.  Cleaning is also simple.  There is a safety lock on the handle of the fryer pan so that the inner basket that holds the food can't dethatch from the pan when it is lifted after removal from the oven.The controls are easy to use and arranged in an intuitive manner.  Cooking times are short and seem very accurate, resulting in a consistent level of doneness of the food.

Clean-up is fast and easy. I used the WiFi connection via my phone and the Vesync App to control the AF. But when I tried to use the actual touch pad on the AF to control the cooking the Time/Temp button did not function properly. Sometimes it would work and more often than not it didn't work at all. That meant I could not adjust the cooking time or cooking temperature manually. Amazon did a quick exchange and sent me a new AF promptly. Cudos and thanks to Amazon. No down time. When I received the new unit first thing I did was check the touch pad for function and it worked fine. Fast forward to the 2nd time I used the AF and the Time/Temp button was malfunctioning again. The problem is not as bad as before but there is still a problem. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. There is a Cosori Air fryer group on FB and more than a few people have indicated that they have had the same problem with the touch pad on their WiFi models. I did not see any posts indicating problems with the non-WiFi models. So, not sure what do now: on my 2nd AF and undecided whether to keep it and use the Vesync app or exchange it for the non-WiFi model. My hope is that Cosori will find and correct the issue with a firmware update. If you are thinking about getting a Cosori AF I would definitely recommend the non-WiFi model. Also, I recommend the 5.8 size and you may want to shop for some accessories like wire racks to place inside the AF basket for multi-level cooking. All things considered I think it is still a good AF.

I’m glad I trusted the 10,000 people who gave this Corsori 5.8 QT AF high reviews. I can’t imagine anyone regretting purchasing this item.Detailed review:  This is my first AF and I read a lot of reviews and watched quite a few videos giving AF reviews. I have a family of 5 and my youngest is a 6’ tall teenage boy so I basically cook for 5 adults so AF cooking capacity was a factor.  Other factors I considered where ease of cleaning, ease of use, how much I thought I’d actually use an AF, and cost.I only have had this AF for 5 days as of 7/24/20.  I will update this post in a few weeks. I have used this AF every day since using it.**UPDATE 8/5/2020**:  I have used this air fryer every single day since I purchased it.  I am amazed at how easy it makes cooking chicken breasts, chicken tenders, and pork chops.  I especially like how the meat is fully cooked (I test using a meat thermometer) but still so tender and juicy.  On my list of foods to try are a whole chicken and steaks.  My teens use it to toast their sandwiches for lunch.  It's awesome at reheating leftovers (especially pizza!!!).  Oh, yes, it makes awesome fries and onion rings.  I am so happy I finally purchased an air fryer, and this Corsori is still easy to clean (even after I made pork chops with a lot of sauce the other night), easy to use, and has made cooking so much easier.  I continue to highly recommend the Corsori 5.8 QT Air Fryer.What I have made so far:*French fries (frozen) - yes, excellent!!  Easily handled entire bag and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, just how I like them.*Fried zucchini:  the traditional flour, egg wash, breading. Instead of frying in a skillet of oil I simply misted the slices with olive oil. They were wonderful. Next time, I will try to make a keto version of these.*chicken breakfast sausage links - also very good*frozen salmon patties that I purchase at Costco - very good!  What I like about this is that the salmon patties are usually my lunch. I practice 16:8 intermittent fasting. I don’t have the patience to do a lot of cooking for my first meal of the day and I want protein. This AF quickly cooks my salmon patty, it is delicious, and clean-up is a breeze!*Italian hot sausage sandwiches - oh my! ❤️  I purchased the accessories for this AF. I used the cake pan in the AF to cook the onions and peppers.  Then, I removed the veggies and cooked the sausages. My entire family and I loved how the AF cooked the sausages - crisp on the outside but juicy on the inside. Once the sausages were cooked, I made the sandwiches (sliced the sausage roll, put a sausage link in the roll, topped the sausage with the already cooked veggies. I put the sandwiches in the AF at 380° for 2 minutes.  Oh my!  I wish I had better words to describe just how good these sandwiches were!  Disclaimer:  I could have squeezed 3 sandwiches in at once but everything I’ve read says airflow is important, so I only did 2 at a time.** update 8/5/20:  I have also made boneless chicken breasts, bone-in chicken pieces (breasts, wings, drumsticks), and pork chops.  Everything has turned out great!Size:  the square basket (vs a round basket) seems to make the cooking capacity of the 5.8 QT Corsori greater than similarly sized AF’s.  I considered an oven style AF but I didn’t want to lose that much counter space. I am quite happy with the size of this AF.Ease of cleaning:  Every time I use this AF and then clean it, I am AMAZED at how easy it is to clean!  👍👍Ease of use:  As I stated earlier, this is my first air fryer. I find it very easy to use. It’s fairly self-explanatory with the preset buttons.How much I thought I’d use an AF:  This point was very important to me.  I have been the proud owner for 5 years, at least, of a bread machine that I’ve only used less than 10 times. Please don’t judge me, I hear about it all the time from my family. I have used this AF everyday since I received it, some days twice. I see this AF becoming an essential tool in my kitchen.Cost:  I am a big believer in “you get what you pay for”.  That said, I have 2 kids in college and another one that will be headed to college in a few years, so I can’t unwisely throw money around. I don’t have any experience with any other air fryers, so I can’t comment on whether I think more expensive brands are worth the extra expense or not. What I can say is that I think I definitely got my money’s worth with the Corsori 5.8 QT air fryer.Final words:  if you are lost in the sea of various air fryer brands, in my opinion you will be very happy if you decide to purchase the Corsori 5.8 QT air fryer.I purchased the AF with my own money and I am not reimbursed in any way for this review. I seldom write reviews but I am so impressed with this AF and I want to help anyone who is as befuddled as I was when I was trying to chose which AF to purchase.Other recommendations:  I did purchase the accessories that are available from Corsori for this AF. I am glad I did, they make the AF even more versatile. I recommend having tongs that are safe for scratch resistant surfaces. Lastly, I did put an insulated counter protector under my AF. It doesn’t seem to get that hot under my AF but I have new counters, so I am using a protector just in case.",I love my Corsori 5.8 Qt air fryer,Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,12,11,Public,4976230.0

We have had no problems with the air fryer so far. The touchscreen is pretty easy to figure out (the User Guide helps as well, of course) and responds from especially light touches. Cleaning is surprisingly easy: we wait until it's cool (roughly 10 minutes) then put in the sink, fill with hot water and a squirt of Dawn, wait until we've finished eating, then wipe with a soft rag or sponge and rinse. Done.Now, about recipes. You can find a stunning amount of recipes on the web, even recipes specific to the Cosori; HOWEVER, our experience is that we have to test recipes until we get results we like. This is where we think air fryers really shine. You can always adjust the temperature and/or cook for a couple of minutes longer, so we check it every 5 minutes or so. For example, we tried English Muffin Pizzas and had to cook them twice as long as the recipe called for. Same for Parmesan Red Potatoes. Chicken Tenders took 2 minutes less than the recipe called for. So it's best to assume you will have to tinker with time/temperature rather than count on the recipe being perfect first time every time.We found Fabulessly Frugal (on YouTube) to be a pretty reliable source for Air Fryer info, especially since the host has a Cosori 5.8oz and she is very good about giving clear instructions ... and because we like her sense of humor.

I don’t have a dishwasher so I have to hand wash it myself and if I cook with oil or anything that stains even when I use parchment paper and foil all of that gunk sticks to the slits in the side of the basket.

After looking around it seemed that Cosori has a decent reputation for support and that their non-stick has a good rep for not de-laminating. Enter a good sale and I purchased one.I think we have had it a little over a month and it has been used anywhere from once to four times  a day. We cook a range of stuff from garlic bread to fried chicken,  vegetables, fish sticks, hot dogs, fish, beef, french fries etc. in it.I gave up eating fried chicken a few years ago. My digestive tract isn't as friendly to greasy foods as it once was. I grew up in the south and fried chicken was a staple at my grandmothers house and my mom made it a lot also. When I left home I made it though not as often as I get irritated cleaning the spattered grease up. Finally with the digestive change it left my menu but I really missed it. Now it is back on the menu. I cook chicken a couple times a week now at least and it is great.for better than my mom's or grandmothers breaded fried chicken I take oil of choice and rub a light layer onto a couple large chicken breasts, sprinkle with salt and pepper (or other seasoning of choice) and then sift a heavy layer of flour and pat it in. (I can no longer eat wheat so use rice or oat flour and it is absolutely wonderful.) Place the chicken in the air fryer and just use the stock setting for chicken. It is crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. If you cut the chicken up into smaller portions you probably want to reduce the cooking time from 25 min to maybe 15 to 20.. you'll have to get a feel for it.French fries took a few tries get right.. fresh vs frozen are two different ways of cooking. Fresh use the recommended setting depending on how thick.. if thinner then reduce time a little maybe. frozen you need to reduce time by about a 1/3.Fish sticks such as gortons frozen I use the chicken setting but reduce it to about 20 minutes.. they are lightly crunchy on the outside and moist and tender inside. other brands with thinner fish sticks need reduced cooking time so that they dont dry out.sausage dogs I use the chicken setting with about 18 minutes to get a bit of blackening and cracking of the skin going. For just cooked but not till the skin breaks probably 13 min maybe.anyways it is up there with our rice cooker and electric pressure cooker for devices we use a lot.",It's going to be hard not to rave to much,Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,"1,374",298,Public,14033.0

The back of the machine started smoking and I immediately unplugged the item from the wall as quickly as possible. After letting it cool down I opened the basket to inspect. Fries were still slightly cold inside, but it looked like a French fry had fallen out of the basket and was stuck between the inside of the machine and the basket.

With that background, I can say I really like the features of this unit. There is one design shortcoming - if you wish to open the drawer and reach into it to adjust the contents (e.g., turn over items on a breakfast sandwich, for example), the drawer will not stay seated in the appliance. So, in order to do this, you must physically remove it, and place it on a flat surface (the Philips drawer can be pulled out enough, in place, to do this). This is considerably less convenient than just ""adjusting in place."" Also, I am a little disappointed the manual setting in the app does not have a dual temperature setting. So, for instance, if I want to put something on for 4 minutes at a low temp to defrost it, then switch to a higher temp to cook, that capability appears to be missing from the app. I would expect this is something that could be easily added to the programming, so perhaps the mfr will make some improvements. Another inconvenient thing is, when the lock screen comes on (app), and you have to log back into the phone to get to the app, it does not always seem to be in the same state where it was left. It would be better if the operation of the app would suspend the lock screen. I am not 100% sure this can be done, but surely it can. But, this ""messing around"" with the phone significantly negates the convenience of using the phone to set the time and temp (also coupled with not having two or three cooking steps available at one setting). That being said, this isn't really meant to be a particularly negative review, because all of the other design elements appear to be above average. I gave it three stars because of these slight shortcomings, but I really think it is 3.5 stars, but I am not strong enough on it to round up, so I rounded down.",Great Features and Price.

Actually they offered me the choice of a refund or to put me on the list to send me a replacement as soon as they had new stock. Excellent customer service. I then bought the exact same model again (found another one on Amazon) and my new one does not have the issues with the freezing buttons I wrote about in my previous review. So in short I am very happy and am enjoying using the air fryer both through the control panel and the app (and Alexa).------------ Original review ---------------This one was a replacement for one that was a little bit bigger and would not fit where I wanted to stored it and it cooks just as (very) well. I do enjoy playing with the wifi/app control but would be the first to admit that it is a bit of a toy.What is not good and the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 5 is that the buttons are not easy to push and register input. There often seems to be a short lag where it seems like the device is frozen taking the button input. This is pretty annoying as I often have to push a button multiple times to get it to register, even more so when you are changing time/temp so need multiple pushes to register, so I generally prefer to use the phone app to kick it off and adjust it. It is possible that mine is just a hardware dud where the senors for the buttons are misaligned with the buttons display, but that does not explain the input freeze behavior I am experiencing. My girlfriend hates using it and wanted me to return it.",Updated: replaced unit functions perfectly.,Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,422,35,Public,196954.0

One thing I disliked was the super loud menu beeps.  I scoured the internet and emailed the company to no avail.  However I did take matters into my own hands and fixed the loud beep.  This was very easy to do, however, be warned and do not do this if you feel at all uncomfortable with the steps.There is no built in way to lower or disable the beeps from pressing menu buttons.

Oh btw do this at your own risk, I'm only reporting what I did which most certainly was dangerous risky voided warranty etc. And for goodness sake people, unplug it and leave it be to cool down and stuff.

You can identify the speaker by seeing the board notated as BUZR next to it. The black cover piece to speaker has a hole in center of it. After pulling it off (gentle force) there is a circular flat disc, seen in pic, appears to be possibly magnetic. Simply pick it off and replace the black speaker cover. Boom no sound.

Apparently the truth is not appreciated. Like so many other recent reviewers I purchased this item on Prime Day -- supposedly new -- yet received a sloppily packaged model that had obviously been returned by a prior customer. The tell tale signs were all over the place, including a dented and stained box plus erratic tape aimed in all directions and covering a prior rip. The warning label atop the machine had a small stain and was partially coming off at the right front.Very disappointing. I still got a good price but I basically received ""Like New"" disguised as New.It took me several days to decide whether or not to return the item. I decided to keep it, despite the poor initial impression. Contrary to one review I read before they were yanked, this air fryer can be used manually. I have no interest in the smart functions. Plugging it in and tapping on the front screen reveals the On button. From there the full display shows up. The manual is above average and makes it easy to figure out the manual operation. I have enjoyed the items I've made so far. I've discovered that preheating is not really necessary. Find the time and temperature estimate for your item and then if anything subtract a minute or so. I prefer online consensus regarding time/temperature for each item instead of using the supplied material.Overall I'm satisfied with the machine but this has to be a low rating due to disgraceful Prime Day shenanigans.",Prime Day means dump the returned items as new,Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,330,79,Public,89928.0

I don't like small kitchen appliances sitting on my counter, especially when they're often rarely used. I dislike clutter. Toaster, slow cookers, all get stowed in a cabinet. I'm also not into buying gimmicky items. So more or less, I was really hesitant to buy the next ""new"" small appliance and put it on my counter. I mean, after all, this is just a mini oven right?I did a lot of research. Way too much really. Brands, features, size, color, uses, reviews, videos. What to buy!? This is too complicated! Needless to say, I settled with the one I'm reviewing here. Why? I liked the size. If I'm going to give it a chance to be used for my family of 4, I wanted to be able to use it as often as possible. Not too big, not too small. Shape. I like the square tray. Easily fits more items than round and takes up the same counter space width. Color and texture. Brushed, flat finish hides things. It doesn't look like ""cheap"" plastic. The buttons are only visible when in use. Clean look. Features. Several presets, although I could honestly just do with a heat dial and a timer. Treat it like a microwave and wing it. Maybe a little hidden cheat sheet. Price was reasonable and it had great reviews.So we kept it on the counter for a few months now we made a spot for its permanent home. We use it several times weekly which surprised us. No, we aren't regularly making meals and suddenly becoming gourmet chefs, but when we want to warm up a few chicken strips or nuggets, mozzarella sticks, left over pizza slices, or basically anything we want to retain a crisp to that the microwave can't, it goes in the air fryer.Realistic expectations. Yes, there's a lot of hype around air fryers. The reality is, this isn't a miracle machine. Sorry, it's just not so don't expect it to be. It heats things up. Your other standard appliances, microwave and oven, can ultimately heat food in the same manner, just on a different scale and different speed. It's a small version of your oven...for the most part, with the speed of a microwave. It compliments the other 2 but you can live without it.What have I learned now having used an air fryer? Great for small quantities use the oven for bigger amounts or multiple items. Who wants a full basket of fries that have been cooling for 10 minutes while we wait for the chicken strips, when I could put it all on a cookie sheet and toss it in the oven? Not much of a time difference either. Also, don't cook steak in it. Can you? Yes, but you could also microwave a steak or have thrown one in the oven the last umpteen years. It's just hype and a steak will never be better than over a flame on a grill. Last one I'll mention, it doesn't heat through to the center fast. A microwave does better at getting the center. An inch or less thick is about all I'd suggest.Hope this helps!",Unsure if you even need an air fryer?

The app will let you know when it's done pre-heating, cooking, or when it's time to shake. Apparently, you do have to actually touch the start button to run it though. The app will also show you a bunch of recipes, which haven't proven themselves very reliable so far. Googling helped quite a bit and also, similar to real world cooking, time and temp recommendations definitely don't fit all scenarios. I found that for some things I want crispy, it was best to run at a lower temp initially to help dry the surfaces, then run it at the higher temp. You might need to run some items longer than suggested if the basket is a bit full or they are thicker cut than the recipe.The pan is easy to clean. Exterior wipes down easily enough too.It seems pretty functional.The main thing I disliked, is the control panel. It uses touch controls that are easy to clean, but often misread my presses. I have found zero use for all the pre-programmed buttons. I saw an Insignia brand fryer at Best Buy that appeared very similar, but only had knobs / dials on the front. One for temperature and the other for time. Super simple.

It makes great french fries from scratch and makes crispy tater tots no oil needed. Also I made hamburger patties on the steak setting and pork chops. The pork chops came out pretty crispy but I did notice that putting just one allows the meat to crisp up more than having two peices. I would say this works better for individual meals than for large quatities when it comes to meat. I feel that this fryer gets a bad rep because the cooking times in the cookbook are wrong but the temperature at which they should cook at are right. A lot of the times when I let the food fry for the time said in the cookbook it would burn. My recommendation would be to cook the food for less time than precribed and then if it needs more time simply add more time. That is how I started to get better results whith the airfryer because it acctually does a good job. Its just the cookbook thats off.

While it is not the cheapest unit on the market, it seems to be reliable, solidly made, easy to use,  and have the right mix of features, in my humble opinion.Calling this an ""air fryer"" is a bit of a misnomer: it is really more like a handy-sized countertop convection oven. While it can ""air fry"" foods that you might normally deep fry or pan fry, it also does a great job of toasting, roasting, or baking. Since we got it, my entire family has been busily using it to cook almost anything and everything. It is easy to clean and easy to operate. The controls are simple and straightforward with all the things you need (digital time and temperature, a good number of presets, etc.) and none of the things you don't (Personally, I think features like a touch screen are overkill for this sort of appliance - a touch screen would be just another thing that might break down prematurely....).The only downside I have detected is that most air fryer accessories on the market (e.g. racks, grill plates, liners, etc.) are either round-shaped or sized for a smaller capacity unit. It seems hard to find decent accessories that accurately fit and take advantage of a larger square-basketed air fryer like this one. My recommendation would be that Cosori come up with an accessory bundle (racks, silicone cooking pads, liners, grilling plates and mesh plates, etc.) specifically designed for this excellent appliance.",Excellent Air Fryer with Large Capacity / Square Basket,Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,,,,

One no longer works after just a few months, and one works but rarely gets used. My biggest complaint is that Cosori appears to no longer be honoring their warranties. Before purchasing, we did extensive research in which AF to purchase, and settled on the 5.8 Cosori based on great reviews and the large, square basket. Just three months after we purchased, and after only once weekly usage on average; the handle screws became loose to the degree that they had to be tightened after every use. Then the drawer started popping open during cooking. Then the non-stick coating on the basket started flaking off, even though the basket had never been cleaned in the dishwasher (though it says dishwasher safe) and the care instructions have been strictly followed. There are many Facebook groups for Cosori AF owners, which is where I learned that the drawer and handle problems seem to be a fatal flaw, and also that others were having increasing difficulty getting Cosori to honor the warranty. Currently, Cosori is offering customers a partial monetary refund for bad baskets such as ours; however, if you cannot get a replacement basket then having money refunded doesn’t do much good unless it’s for the entire cost of replacing the unit. Cosori used to ship unit replacements to consumers directly, from the sounds of it, but that kind of service appears to be a thing of the past. The fryer itself is decent; it does what it says it will, with the appeal for our family of three primarily being that the basket typically fits servings for 3-4 people. If we can’t locate a replacement basket soon, we will definitely not purchase another Cosori brand item again, but we do enjoy an air fryer and in general are now hooked on this appliance craze.",Beware if your unit breaks; and it’s likely it will!,Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,68,79,Public,1097966.0

So far it works well. I made simple food like fries, various vegetables, and some marinated chicken (not together, all were separate meals).My fries certainly cooked through but were a bit limp the first time around and I expect this was because I used too much oil when I coated them in spices. The second time I didn't use oil at all and even patted the potatoes dry before cooking, and they came out very crispy. Next time I'll try for something in the middle. All of the fried veggies were tasty but nothing that I can't get from baking them on a sheet pan in the oven. They took less time in the air fryer so that is a benefit. The chicken would have benefited from less time in the fryer but that is my own trial and error since meat cuts can vary in size. Still came out tasty and moist since they've been marinating for a few hours.Cleanup is simple; just have to wait for the whole thing to cool down, then I've been giving it a gentle wipe down but haven't made anything messy enough to warrant a full scrub yet.Overall I'm happy with the purchase.

I returned it again.So i ordered it again telling myself this has to be the last time. Touchscreen works but now it won’t connect to my iphone. The wifi signal kept turning on and off!!!!!!!!The food comes out delicious but I am totally annoyed by the fact that their product is partially broken every time I got a replacement.BUY SOMETHING ELSE.

Did a lot of research! Almost wanted to wait another year before getting one. But peer and family pressure forced me to make a decision. After reading all the reviews, blogs and vlogs, I chose this model. For three reasons: 1. Size: Live in a 2br apartment with an apartment sized kitchen. So space is at a premium. I can easily put this on the counter. And stow away inside the now-soon-to-be-useless oven. It's not heavy (for me) so this is a win-win. 2. Features: I can ask Alexa to do something useful finally? Are you kidding? This was a no-brainer. I can now boss Alexa around and have it cook stuff for me. 3. Cooking mode: A bachelors life can be filled with frozen foods. So something that can cook me a steak dinner without having to thaw them first was another no-brainer!The setup was super easy. Got all the packaging, plastics outs. Did the first time use steps (preheat for 5 minutes, do a fake ""steak""). Wifi setup was super easy! I already had the Vsync app in my phone for my hi-tech weighing scale, so just added the ""Smart Air Fryer"". The App automatically picked it up. Just had to specify the model I have and it was done in a few minutes.Couldn't wait to pop-in my cornish game hen. Was marinating it for half a day in some spicy cajun spice mix. Did put the water that had the marinate in the tray. Read somewhere that having a bit of water in there prevents smoke. Put some foil in the basket. Patted dry the chicken, sprinkled some more of the rub and popped it in. Set it at 380 for 25 minutes (also had the preheat button on). Used my phone to start it. But had to actually physically press the start button on the unit. Read somewhere that Alexa can actually do the pushing part for me. After 25 minutes, opened the tray, flipped over to the non-breast side, set for 380/20min. And that was it!The smell was amazing! It filled the apartment with the smell of smoked\grilled\fried chicken! The taste was awesome too! But I think next time I have to add a bit more salt. I relied on the salt in the rub but I think I'll need to add a little more.Really happy with this purchase!",What a gadget!!,Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,745,345,Public,4563.0

The Air Fryer does not product the intended results.  There is no such thing as frying with air!So I wish I had seen even ONE bad review for this mode of cooking or this manufacturer (did read the 2% 1-3 stars reviews on Amazon AFTER I bought it.  Hadn't done the math..it was 2% of 59,000 reviews, that's really credible number of people).  But after reading multiple good comments, conferring with friends and reading magazine reviews and Amazon reviews, we chose a medium sized, middle range price. A very good looking unit.  It did not show pictures on a normal counter but somewhere it said it was large.  But it really wasn't too big and it looked great.  I did the initial start up  ""test"", it worked perfectly.This is where the good review ends.  This is NOT about Cosori, it worked exactly as it said it would and they designed a well made product.  It's more about how the end product turns out and the prep time and the noise and the remnants of aroma hanging in the air.First, we could not keep it in a front facing position because warm air blows around it all the time it's cooking, which could have affected our under cabinet lighting.  So it had to be pulled out from under the cabinets and turn it sideways, or there would have been no place for the large drawer to open. That worked but was a less than ergonomic.  Some people said they used it on their stove, but if you're making a meal you need your stove top.I tested using it by making two different veggies...eggplant and potatoes.  After partially peeling the eggplant and cutting it into cubes and salting it well, I put it on paper on my large edged baking tray.  Layered more paper over it and added the weight of a second tray on top.  Got rid of a LOT of water that way.  Thoroughly dried and oiled (a tablespoon) the eggplant.  Followed directions for air-fryer and in they went.  About 20 minutes later (at 400 degrees) the eggplant was creamy inside, but very chewy (not ""fried"") outside.  Ground it all up in my new Cusinart grinder (thank you Amazon) but had no tahini so couldn't make baba ganoush from it.  Tossed it in the garbage.Next night: ""Fried"" potatoes.  The thing that inspired me to buy the unit.  Imagine real french fries with fewer calories!Two Russet potatoes.  Cut in strips.  Soaked in cold water...1 hour.  Drained, covered with boiling water...10 minutes.  Cooled...10 minutes. Towel dried.  One tablespoon of oil, seasoning.  Temp 380 for 20 minutes.  400 for 5 or so more minutes.  And...the potatoes looked fantastic.  BUT the skin was super dry and they were not ""crispy"", even tho they looked ""crispy"".  Not limp, nice and brown. The insides were delicious, but no better than when cooked in my convection toaster oven or in a fry pan. And a lot more prep.Add to all of this the thing is extremely loud when cooking, three times louder than my microwave (which, btw, was also cooking and I could not even hear it).  When it was all cleaned up there was an aroma of oil in the air, lasted for two days, probably carried by the warm air continually blowing out of the back of the unit while it's ""frying"".One reviewer says ""there's no such thing as air frying"".  She's right.All and all, not worth the time or the money.  Decision made.  Returned it.  So disappointed.  Thank you Amazon for making this experience ""doable"".

There are a few things that catch me off guard when I use it though:1. The temperature only goes up in intervals of 10, so if directions tell you to cook at 375 you have to either go 370 or 380 and adjust cooking times. Not a huge deal, but still a little off-putting if you aren't cooking savvy.2. Cleaning the product is kind of weird. I'm very careful about keeping things clean, and this airflow fryer tests me each time. There are these little air hole/vents on the part you pull out. Whenever I soak the basket to make sure I can get everything off while damaging the basket coating as little as possible. When I go to clean the basket and drawer, little food particulates end up stuck inside. It takes a lot of poking and prodding to get everything out. There are screws holding everything in place, so in theory you could take it apart to clean, but who wants to take something apart each clean?Aside from that the air fryer itself works wonders. I've made a couple of chicken dishes that turned out wonderful, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Pre-made things are good too, like store bought sweet potato fries from Trader Joe's.

I would normally have spent 6-8 hours baking that bread. With temps over 100° outside, that’s a miserable day in the kitchen. Three hours and it never raised the temp in the room. I can’t say enough good about this air fryer. It is definitely worth spending a little extra to get some parchment paper squares, the cookware set, and some silicone items (little cupcake forms). But those things are not a must. We bought them after trying out the air fryer for a couple of weeks. Be sure to go through the included recipe book.

I do notice my chicken breast come out juicy, which I was happy and surprised, thought the air fryer would dry them out, but it depends again on weight of your food.

So, it was time to replace it.  The Cosori Air Fryer Max XL does not have this problem. There is no switch at the bottom. The basket slides in easily without having to maneuver it to catch the switch.  I believe it does a better job air frying than the Power Xl.  The preset cooking times and temperatures are great. It is easy to change time and temperatures and it has a pause feature.  The basket handle is sturdy and locks into place easily.  It is non stick and easy to clean.

It does come with great step by step instructions, but it’s very user friendly.  I held off on buying an air fryer for so long because I know how to cook, and basically air fryers are just small convection ovens. BUT air fryers heat up so much quicker and do cook a bit faster. Nothing magical, but it’s definitely a time saver!  I’m also realizing what people have been saying about reheating food being so much better in the air fryer vs the microwave. I’d say the air fryer takes a little longer than the microwave, but not much and I like the way it reheats many things over the microwave. I’ve also found that you get used to knowing how long to cook and at what temperature pretty quickly. There are many presets but I’ve never used them.  Since I’m a cook, it’s more intuitive for me to play with the time and temps.  The unit itself is attractive. I got white to match my kitchen while it’s out, but it’s definitely small enough to store in a lower cabinet.  I gave 4 stars because the minute you grab the handle for the basket, you’ll think it’s broken.  I’ve read people talk about the flimsy plastic slide cover over the button.  Also when you do grab the handle to pull out the basket, it feels like it’s not aligned.  Every time I pull the basket out or push it back in, I feel like it’s going to break. I won’t be surprised if that plastic piece breaks off at some point.  I did sign up for the extended warranty so I’m sure I’m ok.  Final verdict : I’m glad I have it. It is very convenient.

I also did some chicken wings and they were DELICIOUS.  I even baked a sweet potato in my fryer and it was scrumptious.  I showed my pics to a friend and she had me order a Corsori for her right on the spot!  Thanks Corsori!  The fryer is very simple to use.  Cooks quickly.

What I learned is it does so much more.  I have evolved in to using it daily and cooking almost anything I would normally fry or bake using my stove/oven with much less cleanup and hassle.  I have to admit, I am a sucker for new appliances.  I jumped on sous-vide, which I actually think is the most delicious way to cook cuts of meat especially when entertaining or cooking large cuts but it takes time and some preparation and some mess (mainly in that you still have to use the stove or grill to sear the meat).  Still love it but use less often than at first (it doesn't take much room so no bother).  I then jumped on the insta-pot.  Tried to use it a lot but now it has ended up mostly just being a smaller slow cooker than the one I have.  The pressure cook feature (and other features) can be convenient but not worth having a bulky extra appliance for if you already have a slow cooker.  Now comes to the air fryer.  I had big concerns because of it's size - larger than the previous two things I mentioned.  I saved all the packing material with expectation that I would ship it back.  Much to my surprise, not only does it cook the fries/nuggets (and chicken wings I might add) much better than the oven, it cooks hamburger, chicken, steak, seafood, vegetables, garlic bread . . . almost everything you could cook on the stove/oven quickly and with a really good result (once you get a handle on the temp/time requirements).  On top of that, the cooking is all contained so it doesn't make a mess of your stove, oven, countertops, or pans and it 's cooking tray is very easy to clean - imagine no grease to clean up from the stove area after frying..  I often make 2-3 different things sequentially which makes me at times wish I had two.  That way I could cook the main and side dishes (ie. nuggets/fries) at the same time (although you probably can do it with just one but I have done that yet due to capacity).  My stove/oven usage has dropped by at least 50-70%.  Because of that, I leave this unit out all the time.  It is bulky for a small kitchen (like mine) but fortunately I have a small table just off the kitchen in the breakfast area where this fits without being in the way.  Yes, in the breakfast area because this makes no mess outside of the cooker and it looks attractive enough not to be an eye sore.  Now lets talk size.  I bought the 5.8qt and am so glad I did.  One of the only two wishes I had for this unit is that it held more, although I find this to be mostly adequate for a family of four and I don't think I would want it to take up any more space.  It can cook 3 - 4 large chicken breasts or 4 hamburgers at one time and I am sure it would cook bacon very well but you may not get more than 6- 8 slices in there.  I don't think this brand is any better or worse in this regard compared to other brands of the same volume spec.  I believe there are some models that have a rack so you can increase food capacity.  I'm not sure how well this works but from simple observation of how air fying works I think it would.  Also note, the smaller volume (ie. 3qt) versions are not that much smaller on the outside but noticeably smaller in cooking capacity.Now for the fryer review.  Having not had another, I am very pleased with this model and would recommend.  As I have noted, I like the way it cooks and looks.  Food is very crispy on the outside and finished nicely on the inside and it cooks the entire contents very evenly.  It seems to be well built and the cooking pan/parts are very easy to clean.  The controls are logical and the buttons are touch sensitive.  My second minor wish is that the buttons would be more consistent in their sensitivity but I realize they were designed this way for easy cleaning - so probably a worthwhile trade-off.  In short I highly recommend this brand.  I've only been using it a month and so far no problems.  If I have any problems in quality or durability moving forward I will update this review.  Most of all, I highly recommend having an air fryer.  This is an appliance I can see myself using every day and for a long time.",Not Just Another Fad Appliance,Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,47,34,Public,1240449.0

My roommate doesn't have the same issue, but me and a friend can't reliably push them. With practice, I find that I can do it reliably, though not always on the first try, which I find frustrating. I'm surprised button technology in 2020 is this flawed.On a more minor point, there are screws that loosen and we need to tighten with a screwdriver occasionally. This is infrequent enough that it doesn't bother me much, but seemed worth mentioning.I've been considering getting a bigger air fryer, and I've liked this one enough that I'll check this brand first. Any complaints about the buttons or screws and I'll do more research, but I *am* a brand loyalist so we'll see.Also, me and my roommate are nerdy engineers but neither of us has needed to try out the wifi feature.",Almost perfect,Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,,,

I’ve got a family of five and I needed a big one so when the 5.8 quart was on sale I snagged it immediately. It arrived in perfect condition, the instructions were very easy to follow for set up. I did have an issue connecting the air fryer to the app, I did call customer support to help with that but I had pretty much done all the troubleshooting I possibly could so they unfortunately were not really able to help me. But they were very nice about it and they gave me some advice as far as how to troubleshoot it at another time. I have yet to do it but honestly it’s more so just a convenient aspect to be able to use the app rather than I needed function of the air fryer. The air fryer itself is really easy to use, just be sure to read the instructions very carefully and you should not have any issues whatsoever. You definitely have to play around with the temperature as well as the timing at first though. We ended up getting some pizza rolls and bagel bites and stuff like that to just sort of play around with because we figured if we burnt them then no harm no foul. I’m getting the hang of it but I still overcook some things here and there lol. It took me like two or three times to realize that because it’s a smaller device rather than a huge oven you really do not need to use the exact same temperature that a lot of frozen foods require for an oven, as well as the timing. clean up is a breeze, just use a sponge with warm water and a little bit of soap and if you scrub it right after it cools off then you’re good. I believe The instructions said you can put the basket, the small basket, into the top rack of the dishwasher (definitely read the instructions when it comes to that though!) but I was also told I could put this new set of knives that I got in the dishwasher as well and they started rusting really fast so I’ve just been hand washing the basket and drying them immediately after. Prior to buying this air fryer I saw a lot of people who did use them use foil in the small basket as well just to help with the cleanup afterwords. I tried that with bacon just as a test but unfortunately because of the amount of fat and grease that came off of the bacon it didn’t really crisp up very well and I ended up having to leave it in the air fryer for longer than recommended. Overall you just have to play around with the settings, definitely do the test run of the instructions tell you to to begin with just so you get the hang of it. But I absolutely love this and I’m really excited to make more with it than just frozen food.",Now I don’t have to wait for my oven to heat up!,Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,47,68,Public,474914.0

Over time, this will wear off and the drawer will not fit - and the air fryer will not turn on without it closed all the way.

Fried foods are my favorites, but I hate cleaning up the mess.  Even though I am on the keto eating plan, I still don't like cleaning up the mess of frying food, especially bacon.  I knew a year ago I wanted an air fryer, and it took me awhile to pick out which one was right for me.  I researched, and I read reviews.  Finally I decided upon the Cosori.  The main reason I picked this one were the reviews, not only for the air fryer, but for the positive Cosori customer service reviews.I waited to write this review because I wanted to see how I liked it.  I've had it for two months now, and I purchased it at the regular price.  I also have not had any reason to contact their customer service.  I have used it everyday now, sometimes 2-3 times a day.It is sooo easy to clean.  After cooking, any grease I pour into an old coffee container, and then wipe it with paper towel before I use soap and a sponge (the soft side, not the scouring side.)  The baskets can go into the dishwasher, but so far I have washed it by hand each time because I use it so often, and I don't run the dishwasher every day.I have cooked bacon, steaks, sausage patties, frozen chicken wings, frozen chicken breasts, hamburgers, hotdogs, vegetables, etc.  I plan on experimenting with desserts eventually ... just haven't done it yet.  The first week of using the air fryer, I overcooked a few items, especially frozen vegetables like broccoli, trying to figure out the time of cooking.  No big deal.  I ate it anyway.  It has preset times, which I use every so often, but I wanted to understand the fryer so I experimented more.  I only cook for three people, sometimes four, so the size is just right.  If there is something in particular that I want to cook in it, I read air fryer recipes and ideas from others, then I adapt it to my likes and eating needs.  I am so very happy with my purchase!!!!

Clean up is a breeze especially if you followed instruction to not over marinate your goodies hahaha (guilty of not reading it well enough haha but the food still tasted good!)Overall, I give this unit the full 5 stars for performance, there's a bit of a fan noise but not enough to be a bother, I like the design as the square shape makes it easier to squeeze in my pantry. With Amazon's amazing exchange/return policy, try it!But I have a feeling you will keep it.Cheers!",Worth the money!,Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,,188,136,Public,244432.0

Perfect for households of two or three, or even four.  Easy and fast chicken breasts or thighs or tenders, shrimp, asparagus, jicama fries, etc.  Haven't tried steak since I prefer sous vide slower cooking for those followed by a quick pan sear, but burgers were good.  Most pics show french fried potatoes, which are good, but don't overload the basket like those many photos show---that won't work well.

The wifi capability and app control is a nice bonus.  Caution that it runs a bit hot--we had to shorten the length of most recipes by around 30% or else food would get burned.The real issue is it doesn't seem to be built to last, and most of the fryer's externals are made of pretty thin plastic.  After only around 6 months of use, the buttons on the air fryer itself stopped responding, so we could only use the phone app to control the air fryer.Not long after that, the plastic latch that engages when you put the cooking basket into the fryer broke off, so now it gives a ""basket not inserted"" error and refuses to cook.For this price, I would have hoped for a product that would have lasted longer than just 6 months, so I'm hesitant to recommend Cosori until they make some much needed improvements to the quality of their air fryer.","Worked well at first, but barely lasted 6 months :(",Color: Black-WifiSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,,,

I have found that cooking fresh potatoes in the air fryer first is a bit disappointing.  They don't get nearly as crisp.

My wife got an InstaPot a while back and it slowly became the bane of her existence. She went through Six-dozen eggs just trying to get consistent hard-boiled eggs, ruined two roasts and a litany of other dishes in a little over two weeks. She experienced firsthand the fleeting victory of accomplishing what she set out to do only three times. THREE. Needless to say, once she’d finished going through the multiple stages of grief, rage, depression and finally acceptance, I came home from work and saw the thing in pieces scattered across my driveway. She vowed “NEVER. AGAIN.” and that was that.Until this...Months had passed and she’s started noticing her friends using air fryers. She liked what she saw but the PTSD from the InstaPot was holding on strong. She was leery at first, then decided to pull the trigger... which may or may not have been helped along when I saw the pics of fries and chicken wings... fast-forward two weeks and I came home to ridiculously mouthwatering smells and tears. Only, this time, they were tears of JOY. I looked over and our kids were savagely attacking heaping mounds of fries, nuggets, wings, corn dogs, everything. She even fried half out veggie drawer. The table looked like a cartoon version of thanksgiving, only it was a Tuesday and only a week into the Covid quarantines. My 7-year-old told me to hurry up, sit and eat before she came to her senses and took it all away. To this day, our family has known no greater homemade feast.Five stars.

He kept seeing the one TV infomercial but I when I read the Amazon reviews on it. I didn’t like the ‘toxic death smell’ comments.  So after many days of research and reading reviews, I finally settled on the Corosi. First, I liked the supposed size of it.  And I also like the reviews of the preheating and shake features that make a difference from other fryers.  When it came in I was surprised at the size.And after a couple of months of owning it and using it - I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS.  Size is perfect for family compared to others.  I like the squared deep basket. It is big to keep out on my counter but no biggie to pull out of pantry when needed.  The nonstick basket is easy to clean and I even purchase paper cooking liners for it that help with things sticking.  Why you should buy: 1-Preheat. If you preheat like an oven you giving food a jump on being crispy. 2-shake feature.  No it does not shake for you. But half way through cooking it beeps to alert you to move, flip, toss, shake, shimmy - whatever your food.YOU WILL NEED A LITTLE OIL FOR MAXIMUM CRISPNESS. I bought an oil sprayer that allows to spritz the food with enough to cook/crisp food.  We have used a lot for frozen items instead of using oven.  Tip: for exception of potatoes like fries - keep things in one layer. If you throw in on top items, the bottom items may not crisp up enough or you will doing a lot of turning. Takes one more run maybe but it’s worth having crispy spring rolls or taquitos when they are cooked in one layer.Did cook burgers once. Feel like it really shrunk them but they came out ok.  Did hot dog and those came out great.  My husband has done frozen chicken wings and he loved how they came out.I did buy the additional kit that has a pizza pan and other items so will need to try those considering in lock down due to COVID-19 right now.UPDATE: I have read other reviews of basket handle breaking/cracking.  With all things you cannot manhandle it.  It should not be dropped.  All it takes is a gentle push of the button and slide out.

I purchased two, one for the main course and another for the side dish. I like that I only need a light spritz of oil (I use avocado oil) to get a super crispy coating on fish, chicken, and pork. This air fryer also does a nice job with vegetables, like carrots, green beans, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower - and of course french fries or homefries. I bought it to make chicken wings, and it’s the king of chicken wings. They always come out juicy, crispy and flavorful. You feel like you’re having something sinful, but there’s nothing sinful about a Tsp of oil for a meal to serve four people.I’m a baker, and so was pleasantly surprised to learn that most things bake nicely in this mini convection oven; muffins, cheesecake, and banana bread, wow! They all come out great. My blueberry-raspberry streusel topped muffins bake up in just 10 min in a 4-muffin tin. (see pics)Clean up is mostly a breeze, depending on what you put in there. I’ve learned to brush a light coating of barbecue sauce on chicken with only three minutes cook time remaining, so to avoid food burning and staining/splatter where I can’t reach to clean well. I’ve noticed that splatters sometimes do make it above the cooking element to the fan and above. It’s not easy to clean there, but a wet q-tip works pretty well. Mostly I want to avoid having something too saucy in there that will send splatters up where I’d rather not have to clean. Also, I worry about the lifetime of the unit in that regard.Cleaning the basket is usually pretty routine, except I’ve noticed that non-stick spray is a big no-no. It tends to gum up on the basket after a few meals, and is difficult to clean off without marring the non-stick coating. The “fins” design of the basket is ideal for allowing the hot air through, but not for cleaning. Don’t let that scare you away from buying, just be aware that you may need to soak the basket for a while. The bottom piece has never been a problem to clean.Cosori’s air fryer is a great addition to my kitchen. I imagine that it will be a huge blessing on hot days when heating the oven (and the kitchen with it) is the last thing I want to do. The Cosori staff and chefs have been great and quick about answering multiple questions.

We made several dishes but was stuned to learn it takes at least 25 minutes to preheat the air fryer. Then when we took the 1st dish out to shake and redistribute food half way through, we didn't realize how heavy and awkward it was to do this. After finishing the first dish we had the food prepared for the second dish, not realizing it doesn't hold heat therefore had to restart another 20 plus minutes of heating before getting to the proper temperature.  2hrs later we are sitting down to eat. The food was good, but not sure about the value of time especially with time to preheat. Actually can cook healthy in less time conventionally.

I sent a video and they told me that was completely normal...so I did not return it & trusted what they told me. I did question other things about my unit, as I had watched every video I could find showing un-boxing of the unit...etc. and there were slight variations in the way mine was packed & boxed. My unit also had some scratches...etc., on it’s face, which I let slide.

I am so happy I don't have to waste time waiting for an oven to heat up or a fryer anymore. I decided to get this air fryer due to fatty liver and I am so happy I did. So far I've made greek chicken kabobs, cake, tater tots, homemade fries, frozen fries, meatloaf, and entire chicken. Everything had a little crust or nice crunch to it. French fries look beautiful and taste great. You can taste the healthy cooking with this. I cook with alot of seasonings and flavor, so just enhances all the flavor. Frankly everything seems to hold the flavor just perfectly. When I cooked the whole chicken in it, I was expecting to find the juices in the bottom tray and there was none. I thought it may have dried out the chicken. Lo and behold after letting the chicken rest for 10 minutes I cut into it and all the liquid was still in the chicken, perfectly crust, and perfectly cooked. I have fed 5 people with this machine no problem. I do not put in dish washer and will continue to do that. It cleans up very easily, after every use, no scraping, necessary. The best thing of all is that I have no oily messy cleanup on my stove, etc. Wish I would have done this before. I cook alot and this makes things easier. Now I will just use my stove for boiling and cooking eggs- very little cleanup. Hopefully, my health will improve and this machine will last.",So far so good!

I love how big it is and the square shape. However, what inspired me to buy it was the fact you can press a release button and the basket comes out. This makes it easy to dump the food right onto a plate or dish, my old ninja (which worked great) just had an attachment that fit snug in the bottom so I couldn’t dump the food out with out getting the crumbs, juices, and oil that had accumulated at the bottom on top of all the food. This is easy to use also. There are pre-set settings or you can change the temperature and cook time manually (just have to press a button once or twice) I have made frozen snack type food in it and food i battered or breaded myself. Both come out amazing. I bought an oil spritzer off Amazon and fill it with olive oil or coconut oil and spritz the food every 5 minutes then shake the basket and continue cooking. That really makes a difference in the final product when it comes to homemade breaded dishes. If you are thinking of buying an air fryer I highly recommend this one. This is even great to reheat leftovers. (Pizza may even be BETTER the next day if you are warm it up in the air fryer). I haven’t had any issues but I have only had it for like two weeks. With in those two weeks I have used it almost everyday. My kids love it and my 9 year old uses it by herself constantly.

Cooking is actually fun again -- no more sticking my hands in a hot oven or getting burned by splattering grease on the stovetop.  The steaks come out juicy and tender on the inside, as they should, yet they are still cooked properly.  And don't even get me started on the fantastic french fries.  I even cooked a whole chicken breast in there yesterday.  While it just fit in the basket diagonally, I did have to perform a little surgery on the sternum as the basket was not quite deep enough, but it was worth the effort.  I have had this air fryer for only a week and a half, but am using it daily to experiment with.  As for those complaints about these baskets falling apart easily, I am checking each time I use it to make sure both parts are latched together properly before lifting them, and being careful to not touch the release button (which has a built-in safety cover) until I have set the unit down.  It seems to be very well built and cleans easily.  Cosori even provides a customer-support phone number, which is rare these days, and they are also offering an extra year warranty for free, if the form they provide is sent in within two weeks of purchase, which I did.  All the directions are clear and easily understandable, and the recipe book is quite handy for learning of the possibilities.  Plus, the machine offers suggested temperatures and cook times on its dashboard, all of which can easily be overridden by any preferred changes.

I purchased the 5.8 quart size after reading reviews, and also considered overall reviews, the footprint of the unit, and the functionality for the cooking I wanted to do. I also wanted something that was dishwasher safe because many units do not have a dishwasher safe basket.I am very happy with the functionality and it does a nice job cooking food. Obviously this is key since it is the reason for the purchase.I also like the footprint which is smaller than mini units. This was important to me since the unit is a little bit large for my cupboard storage and I knew I would be leaving it on the counter. The unit measures 11 inches wide, 13 inches deep when you include the handle, and 12 inches high. Very similar in measurements to a coffee maker. I posted a picture with a coffee cup just to give some scale.My main disappointment is that The unit is very large to place into the dishwasher, taking up almost a quarter of my space in the dishwasher. See the picture I posted for reference, and my dishwasher is full size. That said, the size is also a blessing because you can cook for 2-3 people and the Unit gives you more flexibility. However even washing by hand I find a little bit difficult because of all the vent holes and it seems like it washes best with some kind of a sponge or brush so that you can get into the grooves to get it clean if you are not putting it in the dishwasher.Functionality for me rates a five, and I gave a four to the overall unit simply because of the lack of ease for cleaning in my opinion.",Here’s what to consider before purchasing,Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,784,91,Public,12700.0

Avocado Oil is a must, or any other high heat oil, this will keep your Air Fryer safe. DO NOT use the spray oil as it can harm your Air Fryer.

I especially enjoyed reading the review from someone who said she was not a good cook.  I do consider myself a good cook.  I ordered two spray bottles that I filled with oil and I already had a digital thermometer which I consider essential.  I will try to give you some different experiences I have had with the Corsi.I have cooked frozen biscuits at about half the time as in our electric range.  Preheating takes only about 4-5 minutes as opposed to 10-12 minutes in our range for the same temp.  I cooked frozen ready made Cordon Bleu and cooked itat the recommended temp for only 17 minutes instead of the 31-33 recommended for a regular oven.  French Fries are great, especially Steak Fries by O.  About 10 minutes using the FF setting and reducing the time.  Steak, Pork Chops, and Meat Loaf turned out great too.  I used my digital therm. to check the doneness.  I don't eat seafood so I cannot comment on that.  Left over Pizza takes only 3-4 minutes after you preheat and tastes just as good as the first time.  I have not try any recipes from their cookbook but do check it out for ideas.  I have not baked in it yet but I have taken part of an unsliced loaf of bread out of the freezer, thawed it for 30 secs in the Micro and then put it in the Corsi for 3-5 minutes in the preheated unit.  Bread is soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside which is true of many items cooked in the Corsi.  Originally I made a place on a shelf to store it but now it is on the countertop because we use it almost every day. Cleaning is a snap too.  I put the cooking trays into soapy water in the sink.  Nothing has stuck yet. Cleans up easily and dries quickly.  It seemed like a large piece to put into the dishwasher and we use it almost everyday.  I forgot to mention that I purchase plain donuts from the supermarket and put them in a preheated unit for 2-3 minutes.  They taste great hot!We live in Florida where summers are hot and we don't like to heat up the kitchen with the range.  The sides get warm but not hot except for the vent in the back.  It is a little noisy, similar to low speed on a range hood.  Overall, we like it and find this size a good choice because most foods for us can prepared in this appliance.  I especially enjoy the French Fries.","Quick Cooking, Tasty Results",Color: BlackSize: 5.8 QTVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,176,291,Public,
