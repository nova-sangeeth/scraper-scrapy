We have limited space in our kitchen, due to the size of it as a whole, so we put off buying a kitchen scale. After baking bread the last time around I decided that it was time to look to see if a scale could be found that would be small enough for storage, while still offering functionality to measure the weights as precise as possible. I looked at a few of the different scales available on Amazon and was definitely not interested in getting one that relies on a watch battery and also wanted one that didn't round the numbers up. This Ozeri Pronto has a small profile, uses two AAA batteries (which were included with the scale) and is precise within +/- 0.1%, based on the testing that another review for this product was able to determine.This Ozeri Pronto food scale was used for making both English muffin and Black Canyon sourdough breads. The English muffin bread was broken in to two loaves and the Black Canyon bread was broken into six parts. This time around I made three loaves, using our new   Freshware CB-104RD 6-Cavity Mini Silicone Mold for Soap, Bread, Loaf, Muffin, Brownie, Cornbread, Cheesecake, Pudding, and More           and broke the other three into another six parts in total to bake with ham and cheese stuffed inside.I noticed two aspects about this Ozeri food scale, which I don't see as an actual issue, but thought I'd mention. The first is that when I was changing the bread and the tare weight was zero it turned off in less than two minutes, as it felt like it took me about 30 seconds, but could've been a minute, between removing the one dough and had to stop before the other was almost placed on the scale. Basically, you'll want to make sure that any and/or all of the items that you plan on weighing are very much at the ready, otherwise you might need to turn it back on and set the tare up again. The other thing to note is that the ounces appear to change in increments of 0.03, which can make it almost impossible to get a truly precise measurement, but is still pretty close.For the first time since baking homemade bread, all of the various loaves had basically the same pre-baked weight and came out looking approximately the same size too.This Ozeri Pronto food scale works well and I look forward to using it for years to come.

At this point, I’m not sure about any of those qualifications.Firstly, the only metal in this thing is whatever was necessary to connect the batteries.  And the batteries.  That’s it.  As my photo shows, the scale bed is funky textured plastic.  I verified this suspicion by the application of a magnet, which just laughed itself off of the thing, and rolled giddily around the counter top.  Pretty sure this puts it in the “not sturdy” category.  The weird texture certainly nudges it into the “not cleanable” a lot further than if it had been simply smooth plastic.  Is it reliable?  Other reviewers, who had the energy actually to weigh known quantities say yes.  As I will never do that, I merely hope that it is consistent.  That will do.As for the colours, which appear to be geared toward matching current Kitchen-Aid themes - don’t bother.  I ordered the scale that appeared to be the lovely appley green of my mixer.

Grams and milliliters are identical. Pounds, pounds:ounces, and ounces are all the same number formatted a little differently.

It's one big advantage is the elevated weighing platform which means easier adjustments and reading of the display.  The display is black led and not back-lit, but it is perfectly readable.

I bought the Ozeri Pronto Digital Scale to measure the ingredients for my cat’s homemade food recipe. She has kidney disease so the weight in grams needs to be precise. Well, the scale is off anywhere from .01 to .99 grams (it’s impossible to know exactly how much it’s off because it measures in whole units only). The powder supplement I use comes with a scoop that measures 3.5 grams of product. However, when one scoop is measured on the scale (using the tare, of course) it comes to 4 grams!  That’s a big difference. The supplement was brand new, sealed, and just opened, so it’s not as if the powder had absorbed humidity from the air, making it heavier. The second reason I don’t like this scale is that the grams are measured in whole units only, as I mentioned above. So, for example, if you needed 3.5 grams of product, it would be impossible to measure out—even if the scale were accurate, which it’s not. I don’t recommend this scale.

My main usage is for weighing ingredients for homemade bread and other typical kitchen ingredients for food prep.  I had a similar scale (diff mfg) a few years ago, this one seems to work better. 1st reason I can easily see the read-out display even with a large mixing bowl on the scale.

It would be nice to be configurable.• sometimes the buttons seem to require a precise touch in a certain spot, then other times doesn't seem to matter.• 10ths readings are important on more than an oz.  It would be nice to have a tiny light when the weight goes over 1/2 increment ie gram 4 - 5  at 4.5 light comes on when at 5 off until hits 5.5.  I understand that to get such a fine weight amount for grams means higher cost, but adding $2 for that half point light would really be worth it.So far I have not tested with certified weights, however, one thing is sure, the results have me looking for certified volume and measuring of cups, tablespoon, teaspoon, 1/2 and 1/4 tsp.  Why?  Because,  not one tablespoon, teaspoon or even cup measurement tool I have, for volume when ingredients weighed matches, ingredient weights listed by Manufactures and other information sites on ingredients weight.All in All, I like the scale, would recommend it to a friend or buy as an inexpensive gift for someone.",Amazon purchasers seemed to really like the scale,Color: SilverVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful

(can weigh 150 grams)  Fluff and spoon in? (closer to 125 g).  It can be the difference between a great bread or cookies and a disaster!  So, if I find an interesting recipe that uses cups as its measure, I will use the toggle feature to note what the grams are if I scoop or spoon,  and mark that on the recipe.

Numbers rarely fluctuate (only if it's right on the border), and if I have 50g on there and take 2g away, it reads 48g, and then it reads 50g again when I put it back.* Battery life is good. I'm using the batteries it came with, and they've lasted 6 months of daily use.* Numbers on the display are big enough to read easily.* Can read in grams, ounces, pounds (decimal), or pounds+ounces. Having two pounds options is nice because sometimes it's easier to see (say) 1.7 pounds than 1 pound 11.2 ounces.* Having only two buttons keeps things simple.* Tare function works well.* Scale has no problem going into the negative. So you have the option to weigh how much you take out of a container. For example, you don't want to put a hot frying pan on the scale, but you can put a bottle of vegetable oil on it, tare it to 0, then if pour out a serving of vegetable oil into the pan on the stove and put the bottle back on the scale, it will read -14g.Cons, all of which are quite minor:* It's not quite big enough to put a dinner plate on and still read the display. Actually, you can if you put it at just the right angle. But you can almost always work around this using the tare and go negative trick.* Like most LCD displays, the display is harder to read from certain angles. But this is just how LCDs work. It also doesn't have a back light. Not a big problem in practice since I don't usually cook in the dark.* It has a power-saving mode that sometimes triggers before I've actually looked at the reading. I'd guess it turns itself off after maybe 3-5 minutes. You can work around this pretty easily once you get used to it.* It's plastic and it looks a little cheap, not bad but not really nice either. But for $12, I didn't expect anything different.

It works well however it has a flimsy, lightweight feel due to its cheap plastic construction. You must pause and press the “TARE” button patiently for it to respond. Other scales include savvy, no nonsense buttons. You won’t find that with this one. A tiny bit of patience is required. I used to have a quality Salter scale similar in size to this one however it was manufactured with stainless steel and had a much nicer look and feel. I wish I would have purchased a Salter instead.In case you are wondering what “TARE” means. Here from Wikipedia: Tare weight is accounted for in kitchen, analytical (scientific) weighing scales and other scales which include a button that resets the zero of the scale display when an empty container is placed on the weighing platform, in order to subsequently display only the weight of the contents of the container.By the way I only impatiently purchased this scale because I needed to weigh out flour and water (yes water; their ridiculous instructory calls for weighing water 🙄) in my effort to create a sourdough starter using the tutorial by Jovial Foods. Their tutorials are a wasteful, major pain in the “you know where” day after day.

As someone who's been overweight and still struggling to lose more, being able to measure my food accurately is crucial to helping with weight loss. Honestly, measuring a half a cup of something in a scoop and then comparing it to what it should weigh? I see little surprises all the time. Weight measure is the only accurate way to go when you're trying to count calories and lose weight.The Ozeri Pronto scales are fantastic. I have one for myself and gave one as a gift. They can even handle a fair amount of weight. I regularly use it to measure out the portions for my morning protein shake - and I start off by putting my SOLID GLASS blender container on top and zeroing out the scale!It measures Grams, Oz, Lb+Oz and even ml. Really helpful since most companies use grams but older recipes use oz or cups (8oz = 1 cup) and then some companies will only give you ml for measurements! Ugh! One thing I've taken note of, so far anything I measure in ml equals the same amount in grams. So, in my experience so far, if I have 200ml of something, it's also 200g.The scale body is plain plastic which helps keep the cost down and make it light weight - very easy to move around to where you want/need it.The only negative I can make note of is the fact that the plastic covering on the buttons wears quickly and it's not hard to damage it - so keep it clean and don't go jabbing at the buttons with sharp objects (like fingernails, forks, knives, etc! Guys, it's not a toy and it's not target practice...I'm only saying that out of personal experience. >.>)Anyhow, it's a great product at a great price, what else do you need? I'm actually considering getting a second one, just so I can have a backup should this one ever break.

I’m sure NO ONE is doing that, and although I can’t speak to its efficacy on that front, or to the percentage of you that purchased this for culinary/ legal chemistry purposes, it works just fine for my purposes.I got this scale for tallying my weight for backpacking and primitive camping because it can handle 11lbs max, though I never weighed anything above 7lbs. You can adjust the units of measurement, which is nice if you want to use metric (I weigh in both metric and English) or have lbs/oz next to each other (the most common function I use). It’s amazing how small items can add up quick to a lot of unnecessary weight.I’d recommend it if you want to have a more accurate idea of how much equipment you’re hiking with and how to balance your pack. It’s not going to break the bank by any means. You can generally use a small plastic crate or container, zero the scale, then pop your items in. I even weighed our packs.Sometimes items feel deceptively similar in weight or are bulky/their weight is distributed over a greater area. You don’t want a top-heavy pack, unless you’re into base jumping off a cliff face without a chute or tripping/falling over like an inebriated turtle.Additionally, it’ll give you a good idea if you have any wiggle room for luxury equipment (like that Syrian olive oil and laurel soap…skin is SO soft….:) or your trusty Springfield XDM for bears (and bigfoot, he doesn’t like the laurel soap, only Jack Links Jerky TM).Just pop it on an even surface and boogie-woogie.

I am measuring in ounces, primarily, and I suspect that the actual measurements is in something else (maybe grams?).  It also has a fairly large gap between two units when measuring in ounces, so the sensitivity isn't the greatest.  I would say the sensitivity is around 0.04 to 0.06 ounces.

I was so impressed by this company, not only in the value and specifications, but in what I could see was a remarkable customer service record. When I realized that a kitchen scale would be a great addition, I saw that the same company made these kitchen scales, and again I saw comments and noticed that this company also reaches out to consumers who may have had a problem, but did not let the company know that there was a problem and allow them to make it right.This kitchen scale is very easy to use and will weigh foods up to 11 to 12 pounds in weight. There are also other measurements  that you can shift over easily if your recipie requires other weight specification, with a simple push of the button. You can press the button to turn the scale on, place the container to hold the ingredients you are using and then press the Tare button and it will zero out the weight so that you are only weighing your ingredients. This is so easy that you don't have to be concerned about your ingredients rolling off the scale or inaccurate weights from trying to figure out the approximate weight of the container. This is a digital scale so thankfully you don't have to figure out the dial and where the hand is on the dial and with the older style scales the position of the food can actually effect the weight. The digital kitchen scale, like the digital bathroom scale are very easy to read, which in the case of the kitchen scale will make for correctly weighed ingredients. I tested the kitchen scale, and like the bathroom scale it displayed the same total weight when tested several times.As I stated before, this company is a very Consumer Service friendly company which is rare these days. Not only are they very helpful on the phone (I called them with a question about my bathroom scale), but they also reach out to reviewers who may have had a question about the product or had a problem with a product and never contacted Ozeri Customer Service for assistance. I, like many other reviewers recommend this Kitchen Multfunction Digital Scale.If for any reason, I find that I need to change my review of this product, I will update this review.",Consumer Friendly Company Plus Positive Reviews And Multifunction Capabilities Equals A Good Purchase,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,

When I teased her about that and reminded her to weigh, she said she didn't have a scale.  So I ordered her this one as a surprise gift.  I know I love mine and use it constantly, and I was sure she would feel the same.I was right! She loves hers too and agrees that it's the ease of use, variety of outputs (oz/lbs; g/kg), and compactness of the unit that makes it so useful.The scale is much lighter than ones I've had in the past, but it's very good quality and quite intuitive to use. The pressure plate on my last one came unglued and fell off each time I moved the scale around the kitchen.  That's simply not going to happen with this one.  The construction is much more solid, for all the unit's lightness.The clean black and chrome design went perfectly in my kitchen and my friend's as well (there is also one that is all chrome) and the AAA batteries were included (which is always nice).It's very easy to access/swap out the batteries, and the unit is compact so it doesn't take up a lot of valuable real estate on my kitchen counter.What's not to love?It may feel light, but it's definitely good quality.

I joined Weight Watchers to assist in this process. One afternoon, in making a sandwich with sliced deli meat (not prepackaged), I quickly realized I had no clue what 3 ounces of meat would be. That afternoon I purchased this digital kitchen scale.I have been using this daily for nearly a week and it has been perfect for my needs. The functions are very simple and streamlined. I love the tare feature. Just put the plate/cup/bowl on the scale, push tare (it reduces that weight) and then put your food in the container and your set. Navigating between the different weight systems (i.e. ounces, cups, pounds), is very easy and this can be done while the food is on the scale.I found I do not just use this for meat, but it has come in handy for measuring all types of foods. Yesterday, I was going to eat a portion (1 ounce) of Baked Lays potato chips, only the chips that were left in the bag were bits and pieces. There was no way I could accurately count 15 chips. Used the scale and was able to measure 1 ounce to know the amount I was consuming was exactly one portion. Excessive? Maybe, but when you are trying to lose weight, it is important to make sure the portion sizes are accurate.I highly recommend this scale for the price. I cannot speak of the long-term quality of this scale as I have only been using it a week. Should something happen and this scale flunk out of me, I will update this review.",Perfect for my needs,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I am a little bit crazy about weighing my food so I know how many calories I am eating.  It is so cool how I can place a slice of cheese on it and it registers the weight.  While it sits there, I can change it from ounces to grams and more.  This is so helpful when you are looking at the Nutritional Value on a label and it says 1T (12g) and you want to use half of that.  Also, it is so easy to place a container on the scale and hit the TARE button to zero out the weight.  Then you add what you want to weigh.  I recommend it.",Love the feature that zeros out the container!,Color: Teal BlueVerified Purchase,

We’ll see how well it holds up over time. I tested it by weighing my cell phone and various coins (a brand new penny should be 2.5g, a dime 2.268g, and a nickle 5g). In all the coin tests it seemed accurate to within a half gram— which is about as accurate as one would hope for a $15 scale and coins that have been used/worn. It was consistent on multiple weighings / different coins. It even fluttered between 2 and 3g repeatedly for a penny (which is perfect, since a penny is 2 and a half grams). The cell phone I used is supposed to have a weight in the range of 100 to 200 grams. (I got the exact weight from the website of the cell phone manufacturer). And in this test the scale was only off by 1 gram.The scale’s screen is a bit dim, but ok. I had to hit the tare button on first use out of the box (initially the scale read 15 grams when empty).. but not a big deal at all, and after hitting the tare button one single time, it was permanently fixed. I could see there being visibility/readability problems if a large object is being weighed which covers the screen, but I’m so far very happy at this price point. Will see if the quality holds.",Very accurate out of the box (I tested it a bit)— will see how quality holds up,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Nice and portable. The ""tare"" function, which lets you subtract the weight of containers and other things you want, makes getting exact measurements much easier. Also, I like how easy it is to switch between g, oz, and ml (I think that's all the measurements?) Have been using it regularly for a few months and would definitely recommend.EDIT -The top of the scale has been threatening to come off several times recently. Seeming a little wobbly. That said, I have been bringing it around with me on a few trips recently. The batteries also seemed to stop working for a while but might have been because they got wet. After a few days suddenly started weighing well again. Will need to be more careful now on with the top though!",Decent tool - EDIT,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,
