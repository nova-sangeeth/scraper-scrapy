The first one I bought years ago for me to use and, more recently, another one for my son's first apartment after college.For the price, I don't think you can beat cast iron skillets from Lodge.  If you google ""best cast iron cookware,"" you'll generally find Lodge listed at the top or at least as one of the favorites by different consumer research sites and publications such as Cooks Illustrated even when compared to cast iron at many times the price.The only cast iron cookware that I find to be of better quality than these are those manufactured many decades earlier.  I have a couple of smaller Griswold cast iron skillets made around 1930-1940 and there's a definite difference.  Good quality vintage cast iron cookware is generally thinner walled and slightly lighter in weight.  Many of the older pieces also have a raised bottom ridge, or smoke ring.  However, the biggest difference IMO is the smooth, polished surface on the vintage pieces.  Modern-day manufacturing of cast iron skillets (like these by Lodge) tends to leave a slightly pebbled surface.  Unfortunately, it's getting harder and harder to find smooth-finish vintage cast iron cookware that's in good condition.  And, when you do, it's usually quite expensive.An ultra-hot cast iron skillet is my very favorite for searing thick tenderloin steaks and salmon.  I put the skillet (minus silicone holder) into a 500° oven for about 10 minutes to heat it.  Then I apply a dry rub seasoning to both sides of room temp steak filets or to top side of salmon fillets.  Remove hot skillet from oven (extremely hot, so be careful), place on high flame or burner, and immediately place steaks or salmon onto skillet surface to sear to the degree of browning and crispness desired (usually just takes 1-3 minutes).  Flip to other side to sear and then place back into still-hot oven to finish cooking.  Amount of time in oven will depend on thickness of steak and/or fish and degree of ""done-ness.""  Salmon and other meaty fish don't take long and, since we eat our steaks rare or med-rare, it usually doesn't take more than several minutes in the hot oven to finish.While the pre-seasoning on these skillets (Lodge uses soy-based vegetable oil) is a nice way to start out without having to do that time-consuming step before using, you'll find that the surface of your skillet just keeps getting better and better.  For many things, I find them to be every bit as non-stick as a teflon coating.For cleaning, I use a scraper if I need to remove anything stuck on, but rarely does that happen.  I never use detergent on mine.  Instead I use hot water and a scrubbie to clean.  Always be sure to thoroughly dry cast iron pieces so that no rust develops.  And never ever put them in the dishwasher!The silicone handle cover is a nice addition for use on top of the stove.  While it can handle some oven temperatures, I remove it before placing in a 500° oven since that's higher than the recommended temp for the silicone.","For the price, it's hard to beat Lodge cast iron skillets",Style: Skillet with Handle HolderSize: 12-InchVerified Purchase,258 people found this helpful

But I felt the need to anyways.I have owned cast iron in the past, and honestly, I didn't get it. Everyone was always raving about how amaaaazing it was and how it's sooooooooo good for non stick.  And I would see videos of people sliding eggs out of the iron like it was a non stick pan.  I bought a FANCY iron skillet from a high name brand, and I was like....what?  What was I doing wrong?EVERYTHING. WOULD.  STICK.I basically called BS on the whole thing.  I then went online and learned all this special care for iron and how you ahve to never use soap, and not be too abrasive or you'll remove the seasoning, and basically all of these things where I wa slike....okay.  So.....my food burns onto it, and then.....I can't use soap or an abrasive scrubber to remove it?  So....what universe is everyone else living in????So I gave up on cast iron and happily went back to my anodized non-stick set.Well after a few years I visited a friend and was cooking at her house.  I learned that ALL she had was a full set of Lodge Cast Iron.THE HORROR.I was floored with fear because I am a great cook and was 1000% expecting to burn everything to her pans and destroy them.The cooking, changed my life that day.  It was SO. EASY.Her pans were so enjoyable to cook on that I immediately went home and ordered a Lodge skillet.  I was still nervous about it, but at the low price, who cares!  I am privileged enough that I can afford to spend $30 to see if I like a pan without going broke.It arrived, and it's been a life changer.  The cleaning is not that hard at all, I do avoid soap but I got a brush to clean it with and all is well.  I cook only using butter or bacon fat and the extra savory taste that all of my cooking gets from this pan and it's seasoning is just miles and miles beyond that of my non-stick.  I have gone from using a full 12 piece set, to basically only using one ceramic non-stick pan about 25% of the time, and my one Lodge skillet 75% of the time.  The best.  I want a smaller one too.","Huge Skeptic, I Was Proven Wrong",Style: SkilletSize: 12-InchVerified Purchase,34 people found this helpful

The day I received it, based on the instruction from Lodge's website, I used hot water to rinse it without soap, dried it completely using paper towel, and applied veggie oil.  I then put it on cook top, turned on heat to low, and slowly to high.  I then cracked an egg into it, and a few tomato slices.  I thought I followed every step correctly, but everything stuck on the pan.  It was super hard to clean.  I used a brush with nylon bristles, but in vain.  I then again followed instruction and boiled water for a few minutes, but the food still got stuck on the pan.  I tried boiling water three times and didn't help.  Very frustrated, I dried it and coated with oil.  I tried again the next morning with a Dutch baby pancake in the oven, and again was very sticky.  I wonder what I did wrong and how to fix it.

I have spent as much as $150 on a top name brand ""non-stick"" skillet only to be donated a year later to the thrift store! ~Never again.I needed a new skillet and decided to go with another iron skillet and purchase this one from Amazon. It arrived in a couple of days and in perfect condition. As with all my cast iron I treated it the same way out of the box. I scrubbed it with hot water and coarse kosher salt, rinsed, then set on a burner and turned the burner on low, then gradually increased the heat until fully dry. While the pan is hot, I take a little bit of Crisco Shortening (about a tablespoon) and drop it in the pan, using a pasty brush I spread the melted shortening over the full interior surface, then I take a paper towel and wipe out any excess (but not too dry you want it to have a slight sheen to it), then I rub the outside of the pan, including the handle, sides and bottom. *note* Do this every time you've used your cast iron cookware, and you will never be disappointed in its performance.NEVER - Use soap or detergent on your iron cookware you'll ruin the seasoning with soap. If you do have a sticking when the pan has cooled add hot water only, allow to soak for about 15 minutes or so and clean as usual. Properly cared for your cookware should last your lifetime, be virtually non-stick and extremely low maintenance.NEVER - Allow your cookware to air dry. This will cause rust and you will most likely need to scrub with steel wool, rinse, dry and re-season and you may to repeat this process many times to return it to a desirable condition.Iron cookware can crack if exposed to extreme temperature changes / hot to cold. Food should never be stored in iron, it is for cooking and serving from within a short time period only.I hope my long winded review/comment has helped in some way. I love my iron skillets.

This is not how cast iron cookware should be.  What you really need to do is:1) Scrub the pan thoroughly in hot soapy water with a green scrubby or steel wool to wash off any residual oil and black film2) Wipe the pan dry with a dry towel.3) Heat the pan on your stove top to warm it up and make sure its totally dry.3) Wipe a thin coat of oil all over the pan. (any cooking oil is fine)4) Wipe as much of the oil off as you can with a dry paper towel. What you want is an ultra thin coat of oil.5) Bake the pan at 400-450 degrees for at least an hour, then let the pan cool inside the oven.You should now have a well seasoned pan.

First off the pan is cheap, durable and generally non-stick.  Does this mean nothing will stick to this pan?  No but if you have the right temperature and use the right amount of fat/oil when cooking and take care of this pan it will take care of you.  I would say this pan excels at proteins first and foremost.  I have cooked bacon, eggs and pancakes right after one another and nothing stuck to this pan.  I would say vegetables are also a favorite in this pan as well because of the great flavor this pan helps create through the oil and char you can achieve with this pan.If you are the type of person that cooks and then puts the pans in the sink for a later time then cast iron might not be for you but I have left this pan in a sink for a few hours or on the stove top overnight and cleaned the next day so it is worth a shot.  If you are the type of person who lets pans soak in water overnight or puts them immediately into a dishwasher for cleaning then this pan is definitely not for you unless you are willing to make an exception with this pan.Did I have immediate success with this pan right away?  No I didn't.  I had food stick and I had issues with cleaning the pan and reasoning the pan and had to look for advice on the internet to solve my issues because not many people use cast iron so I couldn't ask them.Some of my mistakes were simple ones to make as I have always used either stainless steel or non-stick pans.  I didn't wait long enough for the pan to heat up.  Take it easy and heat this pan up on medium before you start cooking.  Don't think this amount of iron will be hot in 5 minutes.  You may need to wait 15 minutes to get this pan heated evenly but I would say put the pan on the heat before you start your prep.  The next issue is using enough oil.  You don't need a ton of oil but you should use a healthy amount.  If you are frying then yea sure use a ton of oil but generally your food doesn't need to be swimming in oil but coat the bottom of the pan.  I would advise against using black pepper on your steak if searing.  The high temps will burn the pepper causing smoke and burnt flavor on your steak.  You are better off using just salt before cooking and fresh cracked pepper afterwards.  Acidic food like tomatoes are okay in the pan but make sure you have a well seasoned pan.  I would stay away from sauces but cut up tomatoes in the pan for your first few uses should be fine.  You need to build a good layer first before tackling sauces.  This pan excels at bacon and frying so if you are in the mood to do either this pan will be your best friend.  The pan is shallow so it isn't meant for deep frying but I have done fish and chicken where I had to flip and it worked great.Also take care of this pan.  Scrub it down with soap and water.  Yes you can use soap I do all the time but I also rinse thoroughly and dry immediately over heat and spread another thin, thin, thin layer of oil on it too.  Every other month or so I give it a good scrubbing and then apply a light coat of oil and stick in a 500 degree oven, upside-down for an hour or so and then turn off the oven and let it cool.  This adds additional seasoning to the pan.  You can overseason the pan which I have done and all I did was heat, scrub, wash which eliminated most of the excess seasoning.  A salt scrub can help as well or if you really are in the weeds you can get a more aggressive scour pad and remove all the seasoning and start from scratch.  Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to strip and then dry.  The time in the oven will be what takes the most time but at that point its set and forget.  You just need multiple layers so it will need a lot of oven time like 6 hours or more depending on your diligence.The best advice is keep cooking and don't be afraid to experiment, keep the temperature lower than you think you need and don't rush the food it will be done when it is done.",I cook almost everything in my Lodge Cast Iron Pan,Style: SkilletSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,61 people found this helpful

I am sure this is a cost trade-off as making it smoother would probably require an additional machining step during manufacture.  Comparing side-by-side with our old timey 1920's skillet, the old one (which we use at home)  is much smoother on the inside.  With that said, Lodge's seasoning process does its job as advertised and, after 10 years of use, still provides a surface that is virtually non-stick.  Cleaning correctly is very important in maintaining that surface.  Pay close attention to cleaning instructions.  Never put it away without a light coating of cooking oil rubbed in to the surface.",A superior frying pan,Style: SkilletSize: 12-InchVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

When it came, I couldn't believe how tiny the skillet really is (trust me, you really need to see it to realize it yourself).  Needless to say, trying to fry an egg on it was a total joke.  The thing was so tiny that it barely sat on the stove properly.  Even with the skillet being hot and having a nice layer of olive oil, the egg still stuck to the skillet horribly.  It is SO tiny that the egg barely fit (cracking the egg into it was a crazy challenge), and trying to flip the egg was a disaster (pretty sure nobody's gonna have a spatula that will work).  After the failed experiment of frying an egg, it was pretty much impossible to clean, so I ended up throwing the thing away.The only way I can see this particular skillet being of any use, would be to use it for baking.

The major defect is a 3 mm wide and deep hole on the surface of the skillet pan. I don’t know how the Lodge Quality Assurance employees allowed for this skillet to leave the manufacturing plant. It’s a big hole that can be seen from a few feet away. My concern is that such a hole could develop into a crack and hot contents such as oil could seep out the bottom and cause a kitchen fire or bodily injury. The skillet also arrived with a second hole in its exterior side.I’m just really disappointed because after doing a lot of research, I decided to choose Lodge for my journey into the world of cast iron cookware. I was planning to fill my kitchen with several Lodge products, but now I’m having second thoughts.

I have spent as much as $150 on a top name brand ""non-stick"" skillet only to be donated a year later to the thrift store! ~Never again.I needed a new skillet and decided to go with another iron skillet and purchase this one from Amazon. It arrived in a couple of days and in perfect condition. As with all my cast iron I treated it the same way out of the box. I scrubbed it with hot water and coarse kosher salt, rinsed, then set on a burner and turned the burner on low, then gradually increased the heat until fully dry. While the pan is hot, I take a little bit of Crisco Shortening (about a tablespoon) and drop it in the pan, using a pasty brush I spread the melted shortening over the full interior surface, then I take a paper towel and wipe out any excess (but not too dry you want it to have a slight sheen to it), then I rub the outside of the pan, including the handle, sides and bottom. *note* Do this every time you've used your cast iron cookware, and you will never be disappointed in its performance.NEVER - Use soap or detergent on your iron cookware you'll ruin the seasoning with soap. If you do have a sticking when the pan has cooled add hot water only, allow to soak for about 15 minutes or so and clean as usual. Properly cared for your cookware should last your lifetime, be virtually non-stick and extremely low maintenance.NEVER - Allow your cookware to air dry. This will cause rust and you will most likely need to scrub with steel wool, rinse, dry and re-season and you may to repeat this process many times to return it to a desirable condition.Iron cookware can crack if exposed to extreme temperature changes / hot to cold.

What you really need to do is:1) Scrub the pan thoroughly in hot soapy water with a green scrubby or steel wool to wash off any residual oil and black film2) Wipe the pan dry with a dry towel.3) Heat the pan on your stove top to warm it up and make sure its totally dry.3) Wipe a thin coat of oil all over the pan.

I had a Kohls' Food Nightwork cast iron pan before this.  Both were the same price on during Thanksgiving sale, but I ended up keeping this instead.  The main advantage of this pan is that it has lips for pouring liquids, and the assist handle on the front.  However, while the Kohls pan was only 10'', the Kohls' bottom was bigger and fully covers both rings on my stove.  Nevertheless, this Lodge pan has taller, perpendicular sides, which are more useful when baking or cooking more food with less risk of the food being pushed out of the pan.After reading several professional reviews on cast iron pans, I found the Lodge had the best price / quality ratio.  One review mentioned that the default seasoning on the pan is merely adequate, and additional seasoning was recommended to have the pan nonstick.  I took that review to heart and added some extra oil when I first got the pan to season it before I cooked anything.  After that initial seasoning, I cooked an omelette in it no problem.A few things to note for people not used to cast iron (like I was): this thing is heavy -- you definitely want to use the front assist handle (with hot pads) when moving it.  Cooking in it requires pre-heating -- the pan also retains heat for a long time, so handle with care.  Do not cook on high in this pan, medium or low is enough for me on just about everything.  After the oil starts to smoke, consider turning the heat way down and just let the pan's  heat retention supply the energy. This thing seems to be OK on my glass electric stove.  I carefully checked the stove for scratches before and after use, and I haven't seen any yet.  Still, I'm careful to not slide the pan around.

I like a big pan for family meals or when you just need the room such as making multiple pancakes in the same pan. nonstick/teflon pans are simple to use but they are not made for high heat and the nonstick coat will only last for a few years then it needs to be replaced. I mainly use a large pan for braising or frying meats and vegetables and sometimes adding sauces to them once cooked, like when I cook chicken thighs until browned and then drain oil and add teriyaki sauce to finish the dish. I was going to get another nonstick pan but I have recently started using my Cast Iron pans more so I decided to get the 13.25"" Lodge Skillet at under $40 it is a fantastic deal. I was happy with the size, but beware it is a very heavy pan so my wife can only move it with two hands. Cast iron requires care and knowing how to wash and prevent staining and rust, a few extra steps will keep it great shape and you will have a pan that last decades.I have also seen people doing extreme re-seasoning on these pans to make the sandy texture perfectly smooth on the cooking surface, they are stripping or sanding these pans down. My experience after using this pan for many meals is that it works Great, and there is no need to go to the trouble of resurfacing it. What I did was Wash the pan thoroughly when I received it with warm water and dish soap (this is the only time dish soap is required) and then put it on a medium flame to finish drying it for a few minutes, while it is still warm (carefully) add buzzywaxx or crisbee seasoning all over the pan in a (very very thin coat), put your pan in the oven for 1 hour at 400 degrees and let cool afterward in the oven for another hour, once the pan is cool put a very thin coat of canola oil on it, and your pan is ready to store or cook with! It should be nonstick for the most part but you have to some cooking skills to properly use the pan in accordance with the food your cooking. After cooking just use hot water and a soft brush to clean thoroughly, dry pan and heat on a medium heat until completely dry and let the pan cool then apply a very thin layer of canola oil before storing it.  I have cooked eggs, pancakes, meats with sauces, french fries, country potatoes, fajita steak etc... and I have had no problems with cooking or sticking, just great food and a pan that will last forever.","Big Size, No need to do extreme re-season.",Style: SkilletSize: 13.25-InchVerified Purchase,15 people found this helpful

Once your cast iron is well seasoned it is non stick . I paid about $15.00 for this skillet and five years , 7 months  later it is in perfect condition and likely will never need replacing .  In the same time prior to having cast iron the non stick skillets would have to be replaced yearly  . I also bought the lodge cast iron griddle , in fact bought that one first a year before buying this skillet .  The cast iron griddle  is the best for cooking pancakes .

It keeps food hot a long time and I love that about Cast Iron,  going back for second helpings out of cast iron  your food is still hot enough to not need to be reheated .  Buying the Lodge cast iron serving dishes for that very reason .

In addition the ""pre-seasoning"" was flaking off in chunks, and there were bits of burnt charcoal chunks stuck to the pan, presumably ""seasoning"" that wasn't applied properly, but I could have easily fixed both of those by stripping the seasoning and re-seasoning the pan.

I have two pans from Great Gatherings (Big Lots store brand). One is a large and deep welled 11-1/2 inch pan and one is a smaller 10 inch pan. I now wanted an even smaller pan to round out my collection, but Great Gatherings doesn't make a smaller size, so I decided to go with the 8 inch Lodge pan. Lodge is a name that many people associate with cast iron, and it is an extremely popular (and costly) brand, so I expected a top quality pan for my money.When I opened the box and felt the heft of the 8 inch pan I was surprised. It was heavier than expected. Not a bad thing for me. And it was much thicker than expected as well. Again, not a bad thing. In fact, it was slightly thicker than my two other pans, which is why it had more heft than I expected.I ordered two pans, one for myself and one for my daughter, so I compared the finish and quality of both...that is where I was disappointed. Although I expected the pans to be rough, all cast iron brands are rough these days, (except for one or two brands that are extremely expensive), these were even rougher than I expected. But even that I could live with because with proper seasoning, and continuous use, the pans will smooth out and be slick. yet, I was surprised they were much rougher ""out of the box"" than the inexpensive Big Lots brand I already owned.Most cast iron come from the factory pre-seasoned, but anyone who owns cast iron cookware knows, you still need to season your pan before use. Usually the pans arrive lightly, yet evenly pre-seasoned, but both of my Lodge pans arrived with uneven seasoning and with heavy doses of oil on parts of the pan, that was sticky. That should not be, so before I began to season my pans I had heat them to soften the seasoning and smooth them out with a metal scrubbing pad. It took a while to do, but I got the job done. Then I took to giving the pans two rounds of seasoning to get them cook worthy.I used one this morning and it was fine. I made fried eggs in it (yes, you can make eggs in today's rough cast iron pans) and sticking was minimal as expected. One reason my eggs stuck was I cracked them into the pan before the pan was fully heated. And second, I used a plastic spatula to release them from the pan instead of a metal spatula. The trick to cooking on cast iron is knowing when the pan is hot enough to add your food, and using the right utensils. Also, it is important to know when to gently shift your food in the pan...example, if you are frying up some chicken wait until it has cooked a while before you nudge pieces to shift them in the pan...nudge them too soon, and they may resist and stick slightly, but get out your metal spatula and shovel it under after the chicken has cooked a while and it will slide without sticking.In conclusion, I expected more from Lodge. I expected the pans to be rough, but not so rough, and that they would be better, and more evenly seasoned. But in the end, if they last a lifetime, as they should, I won't remember the misgivings in years from now.",Expectected More!,Style: SkilletSize: 8-InchVerified Purchase,15 people found this helpful

Lots of TLC required. Versatile. Multi-generational. Reasonably priced. Lodge seasoned CI-made in USA.First of all, for those of you who care about country of origin, rest assured that Lodge seasoned cast iron is made in the USA (the enameled Lodge cast iron however, is made in China).Before I delve into the review of this LCI, let me just warn my readers that CI is rather heavy! If you have arthritis or a weak arm and had, you may want to consider a lighter-weight cookware.Now on to the “meat” (pun intended) portions of this review…Cast iron is a forgiving but high maintenance mistress! She will forgive almost anything (even allowing her to rust!!!), but she does require a little TLC before, during, and after each use.  The TLC she needs is:1. Before using: season CI1) Cast iron must be seasoned before any use; luckily, Lodge double seasons its cast iron so that customers may use the product right out of the box, but if you need to re-season the cast iron product, follow these steps:i) Scrub CI well in hot soapy water.ii) Dry thoroughly.iii) Spread a thin layer of oil (I like avocado oil, but vegetable or canola will suffice) over the CI (interior, exterior, handle, all parts).iv) Place CI upside down on a middle oven rack and turn on the oven and allow to heat to 550°. (PLEASE refrain from placing the CI into an already heated oven; the CI heat gradually in the oven as the oven works its way up to 550 degrees F)(1) ***NOTE: temperature depends on the oil being used to season (AO has a high smoking point, but VO and CO have lower smoking points; this means that if you are using VO or CO, you need to set the oven to 400 degrees instead of 550).v) Place foil on a lower rack to catch drips.vi) Once the oven temperature reaches 550 degrees, “bake” the CI for 50-90 minutes.vii) Turn off the oven and allow the CI to cool inside the oven.***Reminder: temperature depends on the oil being used to season (AO has a high smoking point, but VO and CO have lower smoking points; this means that if you are using VO or CO, you need to set the oven to 400 degrees instead of 550).2. During usage: use a “fatty food” the first time you use the CI implement.a. Personally, I love any excuse to fry bacon, so I always “break-in” my CI with bacon slices; however, there are many amongst you who are unable to partake in bacon for religious, moral and ethical, or environmental reasons.  For those amongst you who cannot use bacon, cook a food that requires deep frying.b. Pre-heat the CI before using (every single time) or your food will stick and crumblei. NOTE: Although I ALWAYS pre-heat my CI for cooking, I rarely do so for cake-baking; for cake-baking I used a very liberal amount of my home-made pan release “goo” to fully coat the pan, and I pour the cake batter right into the pan; works every time!3. After using: wash and re-season (NO, not the detailed steps mentioned above)a. After using the CI, and while it is still hot, wash using scorching (wear heat resistant gloves as to not burn your hands) water and salt (refrain from using chemical cleaners)i. NEVER wash in a dishwasher (OMG)b. Dry completely and thoroughlyc. Spread a thin layer of oil over the CI (interior, exterior, handle, all parts) and place the CI on the stove top to heat for about 10 minutesd. Store CI in a moisture free environmenti. NEVER store food in CIii. NEVER store CI in fridge or freezerSo that is the TLC required for a CI pan or pot, but there are still several things to keep in mind:A. NOT everything should be cooked in cast iron!(1)  Avoid cooking acidic foods in CI (yes, it is okay to finish the dish with a small squeeze of lemon (not when skillet is hot) or a few drops of vinegar, it is okay to add tomatoes and tomato paste to the dish you are cooking, but it is NEVER okay to stew tomato prolonged periods, deglaze with  vinegar, or lemon juice to foods while they were still hot on the skillet)(2)  Avoid (at least in the beginning when your cast iron is still getting TLC) sticky foods (fried eggs, omelets, pancakes, scrambled eggs, fried rice, crepes, etc.) as they will definitely stick to your CI; this is not to say that you will not eventually be able to fry eggs or make crepes on your CI, I do all the time, but you will need to have reused and reasoned you CI many times before it becomes fully non-stick.(3) Avoid cooking delicate fish (flounder, tilapia, etc.)  In CI because the delicate fish will not tolerate the heat retained by the CI (an asset when searing steak) and will fall apart when flipped.(4) Avoid (particularly before your CI becomes super well-seasoned) using the same pan for savory and sweet as the CI does retain flavors; in other words, using the CI to bake a vanilla cake immediately the day after using it to make garlic chicken may make your vanilla a tad too garlicky!(5) Avoid using CI to cook foods that require lengthy periods of simmering, boiling, or steaming as the lengthy simmering, boiling, or steaming will strip your CI of its hard-earned seasoning.Are you still reading? If after reading the previous portions of this review, you are concerned about the TLC necessary to maintain CI, then I really recommend you consider other cookware options. (Caphlan non-stick is a viable alternative); if on the other hand, you are still reading, then you are not dissuaded from investing in CI cookware, and I am glad of that!There are numerous benefits to cooking and baking in CI:1) Cast iron is extremely sturdy and is very difficult to ruin. (If you do ruin a CI pan, you can restore and reclaim it!).2) Cast iron heats up evenly and retains heat incredibly well, which makes CI excellent for searing meat, baking corn bread, making pies, baking crusty bread, etc., and for keeping food warm as you serve it!3) Cast iron is healthy; yes, that is true! During the cooking process a trace amount of iron is absorbed into the foods, and when the foods are consumed by you, you are getting some iron into your system (a healthy by-product of CI cooking).4) Cast iron is quite versatile.  You may use CI for almost everything (you make slow cook a lamb leg to perfect or make a three-layer birthday cake for your daughter in CI). Additionally, CI goes from cupboard, to stove-top, to oven, to camp-fire, and to dinner table! Talk about versatility!5) Cast iron is of heirloom status; it lasts for generations!  I personally have a huge collection, and I plan to bequest my CI to my daughter (it shall be written in my will-not kidding).So, to re-cap:CI is a rather heavy type of cookware that offers great versatility, heats evenly, retains heat well, requires pre-seasoning and re-seasoning, and is multi-generational.  And, of course, Lodge is an excellent CI brand. Lodge was founded in 1896 and is one of the very few remaining companies that still produce seasoned CI in the US (in the Lodge foundries in Tennessee). Lodge products are sturdy, versatile, heirloom-quality, and of course reasonably priced (as compared to the more expensive companies).I have been using CI (especially Lodge) for two and one-half decades (yes, ¼ of a century) now, and I will NEVER use anything else! A purchase of Lodge CI cookware and bakeware is a very sound investment indeed!**If you found this review of use, please “like” using the thumbs-up button below.

Lodge does not even list a skillet/deep skillet that is 6in deep. The deepest they list is 3.975in. Most of the skillets at the Lodge website are between 2in and 2.25in.This specific skillet sold at Amazon as a deep skillet, is in fact the normal Lodge 12in skillet which has a cost of $39.50 at the Lodge website. So, basically you get a typical Lodge 12in skillet plus the silicone hot handle for the same price as the skillet at the Lodge website (e.g. no savings).I just feel that Amazon/Lodge should just be upfront about what is really being sold.

The side bar to the recipe rated this Lodge skillet as the top brand for cast iron. So I ordered one and made the cake per the recipe. The cake came out perfectly, not only in look and taste, but also in release from the skillet. My husband did help me turn the pan upside down onto the cake stand which I held up next to the pan as he turned it. (He wanted credit for his efforts.) And like the info in the listing said, this skillet was ready to use straight from the box. I did wipe it out first with a damp sponge and did not oil it as my recipe called for making a buttery topping in the pan and additional greasing/oiling would have been redundant. Clean up was a breeze. My parents had a big cast iron skillet that they cooked in regularly and I disliked it because it was so heavy and industrial looking. Now I think I understand their preference. Yes, it's heavy, but the additional lift handle makes picking it up much easier. And, of course, the weight is part of the reason the pan works so well. So, you might say that at long last, I have become a believer. I am thoroughly happy with my purchase of this Lodge skillet and look forward to using it many times in the future.

If you have never tried cast iron, you should. I have used (far far more expensive) ""swiss diamond"" nonstick pans in the past, and while that doesn't scratch as easily as other nonstick pans, it still wears out. Even with a lifetime warranty, you still pay shipping when the screws wear out. This pan, on the other hand, is indestructible. I have left the heat on and forgotten about it, no problem. I can use a sharp metal spatula without worrying. The iron even seems to add a bit of flavor to the food. As for non-stickiness, the other day I cooked an egg in it with just a tiny bit of sausage grease. The egg didn't even try to stick. For cleaning, it is a breeze as you just run some water over it and brush off any gunk. If you find out a way to get something to stick to it, you can just put it in the oven to burn it off, and reseason. Try that with a nonstick pan.Last but not least, this is the new weapon of choice if a burglar comes.","Nonstick, worry-free pan at a great price.",Style: SkilletSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,27 people found this helpful

And after all that I began the seasoning process, I use flax seed oil for the initial seasoning then grape seed oil for maintaining it. I seasoned it three times and after that the beast was non stick and I could slide an egg around in it.

Second of all, you don't have to worry about any PFOA or other types of coatings coming off in your food and you ingesting them in some way.  Third. cast iron cooks extremely evenly, and does an amazing job in browning all type of foods.Personally, I use it for cooking sliced fingerling potatoes in olive oil.  The 10.25 size allows for more than enough potatoes, and doesn't require you to use a bunch of expensive olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan for frying.  If you buy the pan, you'll have to try this -- the potatoes are easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Also, for the issue of splatter - I've found that my Swiss Diamond glass lid fits pretty good - not perfect, but since I already have it, and I don't need to store yet ANOTHER lid, I highly recommend using another glass pan lid if you have one rather than having to buy a new one.  I also purchased the Lodge silicone handle, at only five bucks - it makes dealing with these hot handles much easier and at that price, I highly recommend it.Finally, you have to love that this is a 100 + year old legendary American made and owned brand.  The fact that you can buy this at the same price as some no-name Chinese pan is a huge bonus, and you really have no excuse not to buy the Lodge.Enjoy!",American Made - High Quality Cast Iron - for same price as Chinese no-name pans,Style: SkilletSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

I’m not that strong of a person so maybe others are fine, but this skillet is not something I can easily hold in one hand while cooking. Luckily for the most part of cooking it is either sitting on the stove or I am just tilting it slightly and letting the stove hold the weight. That being said, the second part to remember is…Cast iron gets HOT!  That’s a good and bad thing. It gets hot and retains heat all over with even distribution, which means make sure you are using something to hold the handle. If you aren’t used to cooking with cast iron, you might forget this and accidentally touch the VERY hot handle after cooking which depending on how long ago you turned off the burner might result in a burnt hand.So now you have a very heavy, very hot pan which in some circumstances is a bit difficult to maneuver with. I originally purchased it for cooking steaks, specifically for sous vide steaks (I wanted that quick sear for the outside of the steak!). I use the method of lots of butter and ladling that butter with a spoon over the steak as it finishes searing. This was slightly tricky for me because of the weight and heat of the pan (I was tilting it and I had a cloth over the handle to hold it with, but it was still heavy and I could still feel a bit of that heat threatening to burn me if I slipped up!). I feel that with time I’ll get better at it, but man it’s a bit nerve wracking!Finally, the cleaning. Now I can be pretty ambitious and pretty lazy with things I do, including cooking. When I heard you have to do extra steps to keep your cast iron skillet in good shape, I put off buying one for a year. For those who don’t know, cast iron pans need to be seasoned before cooking and after cooking sometimes if you want them to maintain their non stick coating… or something. This Lodge cast iron comes preseasoned and you should be able to cook with it immediately, however many sites suggest seasoning it at least once anyway. I don’t know if I’m doing correctly, but I followed guides online and used vegetable oil, rubbed a thin layer all over my cast iron, handle and bottom too, and stuck it in an over at 450 degrees for an hour. Just in case I also put a baking sheet under it on a different shelf to catch any possible oil drippings. After an hour I turned off the oven and let it sit there until it was cool enough to touch. After cooking food with the cast iron, I read that soap and water can remove layers of the oil and in order to clean it you can either just wipe away the grease and food particles with a paper towel, or if food is stuck on, you can pour some salt on the pan and scrub it with a little bit of water. The salt acts as an abrasive and removes the stuck on food. You then rinse and dry as dry as you can because cast iron is prone to rusting. I do the extra step of hearing it for a little while on the stove top to dry off all water. And then finally, after turning off the stove burner, while the cast iron is still hot, I use a paper towel and again rub a new thin layer of vegetable oil all over it again. From what I understand, you don’t have to reseason your cast iron every time, and that cooking with oil does it anyway. However since I bought this thing, I feel like I want to keep it in good condition!Cast irons are niche and there are alternatives to cooking to get similar results, but i do like my purchase despite the heaviness and hotness and the seasoning. The sear on the steak turns out great after some practice, and  I just recently tried baking with it, which was really awesome!",Cast iron skillets are heavy!

But after some research online I'm slowly getting a better understanding on how to use and care for this type of pan.  When it first arrive, I lightly cleaned the pan to wash away any residue from shipping (the box was very beaten up when it arrived).  The first thing I cooked was a fried egg and it did stick a little to the pan.  The key is to wait until the pan is hot before adding the oil and then the egg.  Depending on your stove type you'll need to figure out the strength of your fire (if a gas stove) or the heat on an electric stove.  The advice I found online said the skillet hasn't developed it's non stick surface yet.  So I made a few more fried eggs later in the week and it started to improve.  Each time I used the pan, I cleaned it right away with hot water and very minimal dish soap.  Then I placed the pan on the stove to dry off.  If the surface looked dull, I added a coating of oil.  A week later I cooked some bacon and that helped season the pan a bit more.  Today I made some fried chicken and after cleaning the pan of excess oil, my skillet is looking to be taking on a good surface.  It's not greasy or sticky.  I know eventually I'll get to sauté some vegetables, pan fry tofu, or make a few pieces of french toast without them sticking to the bottom.",This pan requires patience,Style: Skillet with Handle HolderSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

When I went to get a replacement because they were guaranteed for 10 years, or life depending on who I asked, I was asked if I had been using oil and subsequently told that even though they were hard-anodized and didn't require oil, I should have been doing so. For health/ nutrition reasons, I had started to use ghee about two years ago so I did some more research and decided to throw away the hard-anodized (since it didn't stand up to what it says it does) and try cast iron.This is the second Lodge skillet I've purchased. With the first, I didn't know what I was doing and I struggled. Food stuck and clean up was a nightmare. Since I no longer had the hard-anodized to fall back on, I decided to really try with the new cast iron skillet (this one) by following recommendations I read on several websites for seasoning and cleaning (including buying a stainless steel enmeshed silicone sponge, scrapers and a scrub brush).Now, everything is great!! Food no longer sticks (although some things do still leave a little residue, e.g., scrambled eggs and salmon) and clean up is a breeze. I seasoned both skillets (bought the cast iron oil, which is really just flax seed oil I think, and put them through 5 seasoning cycles) and try to use both regularly. I clean them by rinsing with warm water immediately after cooking using the stainless steel sponge or brush; initially I was afraid the food would get cold, but the skillets clean in no time. Then I dry them well and put them back onto the stove top or in the oven to let the residual heat dry off any remaining moisture (I've read that rust can be a problem).The skillets do get hot and they hold the heat really well, so I've had to learn to cook a little differently, but nothing has burned, yet anyway. I do use a little ghee every time and try to make sure that I get it into and up on the edges as it melts. The red silicone handle that comes with the skillet is great at protecting my hand from the heat although I am careful to have another potholder nearby.When transferring the skillets to the sink to clean, this skillet is easily managed with one hand, but the original one I bought, which is larger, can wobble a bit due to its weight so two hands are needed.I know this is long, but I was so afraid of cast iron before really learning about it and wanted to share my experience to help anyone else thinking the same.I'm so glad I made the switch. From what I've read, it should get easier and easier to use as time goes by.

Cast iron pans are so versatile and if you take care of them, will last a lifetime.First off, the seasoning it comes with is not the greatest. If you want, wash it off with warm water, some mild soap, and a wire/steel brush. Ensure you SEASON it after.In the beginning (first 20 uses), I would highly recommend you SEASON after EVERY use. It may seem excessive but it pays off, trust me.I prefer to use Flax-seed oil (not refrigerated), a rag (a few I have set aside only for this purpose) and a HOT oven. Go on youtube on how to properly season and do it religiously in the beginning. If you do it enough, afterwards you won't have to season every time (maybe every 3-5 times) and it'll have a beautiful non-stick layer.For cleaning, I've learned the best method is the following:1. Buy a Stainless Steel Chainmail Scrubber.2. Buy heat-resistant gloves (I already had some for my BBQ)3. Buy some regular sea salt if you don't have any (Mortons works well).Now, here's the process:1. As soon as you're done cooking in the pan, (food has been taken out), pour some salt into the pan (enough to cover the surface), throw the chainmail scrubber in there, and add about half a cup of water (enough to bring the water level to cover the entire bottom of the pan). Doesn't matter WHATS in the pan (eggs residue, fish, steak, chicken, sauce, etc.), this is the best way to start.2. Turn the heat on your stove to Low and let the water and salt warm up in the pan. I usually let this stage happen while I'm eating.3. When the water is hot and almost boiling in the pan, grab your heat resistant gloves and take the pan with the water, carefully, off the stove and over to your sink. While you're holding the pan with one hand, use your free hand to work the chain scrubber all over the pan and rinse under HOT water. If the pan is too heavy for you, you can let it rest on a heat-resistant mat on your counter or on your counter if you have marble/granite or any heat resistant counter-top.4. As you work the chain scrubber on your pan, the salt and hot water should basically help get everything off the surface of the pan. Run the pan under hot water and keep scrubbing until it's clean. Never use dish soap to clean the pan.5. Dry pan with specific tower or rag (this should not be a tower you would use for any other purpose as it will stain) and if you still want to dry more, put on stove top and turn on high for a few minutes to heat up the pan and evaporate any remaining water. Ensure your pan is DRY as any remaining water will RUST the pan.6. Season if you need to.All in all, excellent pan and after 2 years, still looks new following the process above. I've used it for eggs/breakfast, salmon, steak, fish, pasta sauce, potatoes, frying, and pretty much everything else and it's as good as day 1.I've seasoned it enough now that without any oil, I can cook eggs on it and it will not stick.

I'll sand it down, idc. But just so everyone is aware: you do not have to smooth it down. This is a personal preference. And if you do, make sure to season the whole deal all over again.

I would use anything that can be cooked in medium heat on Teflon pans.In conclusion,I would use Teflon for things like eggs, omelettes, cheese, where you only need medium heat to cook.I am now ONLY going to use Iron Skillet pans for any kind of meat cooking, stews, stir fry, that requires High heat cooking, and I will NEVER have to replace another Teflon pan again.",Teflon vs Iron Skillet,Style: SkilletSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Up until last year it was my only pan. I cooked fish, pizza, sauces, meats, eggs etc.  About a year ago it started having sticking issues. I fought with it on and off trying to get it to reseason.  I finally fixed it yesterday and had scrambled eggs sliding around better than a nonstick panIssues: smoking is a problem, it heats up real hot and the oils you add start smoking. Sucks if you don’t have great ventilation which is us.  So I had a lot of trouble getting a reseason as I cant use the oven to do it without filling the house with burnt oil smell.  There doesn’t seem like to be a way around this unless you have a grill or good ventilationI used my charcoal grill fired up to 500f for three hours after scouring the pan and put on  thin layers of flax oil every 45 mins.  This morning it was better than our non stick pan which is definitely seeing its end of days after one year of use. So after five years it’s like brand new which is exciting.

But I love very crispy breakfast potatoes, and I’ve destroyed non-stick and ceramic pans because of it, and everything just sticks to stainless steel horribly. So I tried this and I’m glad I did. The best trick I can tell you is, start with low heat, and stay there. Just accept it’s going to take a while to cook. I have a gas stove and medium is too high to cook with this thing, food always gets burnt, but medium-low is perfect. And don’t wash it. I use it at least once a week and all I ever do is pour a little more oil in after the food is done, leave it over the hot burner, wipe out the oil and food bits into the trash when it’s cool, wipe with more oil if there’s still food bits left, and store it in the oven so it doesn’t get dusty. That’s it. It’s been great. The only time I use water and soap on it is if it gets gross and sticky (you’ll know when) and don’t scrub it that much, make sure it’s completely dry with paper towels, reheat it with oil, cool and wipe again with oil, and store it with more dry paper towels. Oh and I bought a bunch of stuff with this that I thought I needed to take care of it (cast iron plastic scrappers, chain mail scrubber, silicone gloves) you don’t need any of it.

My biggest tip for care and cleaning is to always warm the pan and oil after cleaning, and to get a good ""chain mail"" scrubber to remove stuck on food.  Contrary to what some say, you absolutely can use water on cast iron, just be sure to dry it completely and oil afterwards.  Putting it back on the stove for a few minutes is a good way to ensure that you get all the water dried off of the pan.This pan is great for home and camping use, and really helpful when cooking a large meal on a fire.

Really not enough to rate a 4 star rating, but it's an old USA brand that I think is a notch above, or a half star above all the other cast iron skillets that have the same problem,  a very rough cooking surface. The $20 lodge would be probably a $100 plus skillet if the cooking surface was machined to compare with the skillets of 100 years ago. I have a FINEX 12 inch iron skillet that's like a piece of art. It costs $195 and is worth every penny. If your'e just frying chicken the $20 LODGE works just as well. But if you want a slick non stick cooking surface for all your frying needs, and you want to save $175, Here's the deal. Buy the Lodge. At HOME DEPOT you can buy a AVAVTI PRO Quick-AStrip Disk, for about $6.50, It's a thick semi rigid aggressive grinding disk that fits 1/4 inch drill that will will smooth the iron surface. You can save a couple bucks on a similar product if you have a HARBOR FREIGHT store nearby. While your there, pick up a 3 inch wire brush for your drill, Grind the loose seasoning with the wire brush. Then spent about 2-3 hours as necessary with the grinding disk getting the cooking surface and the sides of the cooking surface smooth. When it's smooth to your satisfaction, you'll see a much smoother surface with swirl marks from grinding. These are minute abrasions left on the surface. If you finish with the wire brush attachment, it will remove the surface irregularities shown by the swirl marks and add to the finished smoothness. You'll end up with a non stick skillet to rival you grandmothers 50 year old GRISWOLD or WAGNER skillets. And it cooks just as well as my $195 FENIX. You definitely want to use an effective particle mask and eye protections for all these operations.

Everything stuck and now it is impossible to get clean. There is baked on crud that is resistant to everything I've tried to clean it. I have spent more on the Lodge cleaning tools than the pan cost. I tried the chain link scrubber with the silicon pad inside. That did nothing. I tried for 15 minutes and hurt both of my wrists trying to scrub it. It did not budge. Next I tried the Lodge brand scrubbing bristle brush. That was totally useless. A waste of money. I also tried a brillo pad which helped a little. I sent a message to Lodge asking for help. They acknowledged receiving my message but no one has replied. That was 2 days ago. Then I did their online chat. The person told me to boil water in the pan. Then she was gone. End of conversation. I boiled water - hoping that it would loosen the crud. I was optimistic because there was a lot of bubbling. The crud remained when I tried to scrub it again. Next I tried sprinkling with baking soda and salt and a little vinegar. And I scrubbed again and again. The brillo pad yielded the most results but I think I've now taken the finish off the areas where there was no crud burnt on. I seasoned the pan again like the instructions said to do. It is sitting on my stove top. I so regret buying this and the cleaning accessories that don't appear to do anything and I'm disappointed that I still haven't heard from the company.

No kitchen is complete without a cast iron skillet.------Now that's out of the way, if you haven't cooked with cast iron you're missing out, and you've also got a lot to learn, so here's a crash course to help figure out if this skillet is right for you.Advantages of cast iron:* cast iron has a high density, thus is retains heat extremely well* it's great at distributing even heat* properly seasoned cast iron can perform with the best non-stick pans* they are built to last longer than you, many are passed down generation to generation* you could rearrange a home intruder's face with a good swing of a cast iron panDisadvantages of cast iron:* unseasoned cast iron will rust quicker than you imagine* takes longer to heat up than your nonstick or steel* will probably crack if thermally shocked or dropped* they are heavier than any other type of cooking vesselA lot of the disadvantages of cast iron are easily addressable with a bit of common sense. First and foremost, cast iron has to be completely seasoned. This means the cooking surface, the bottom, the handle, everything. The good news is, this is pretty easy to do and the more you use the pan the better your seasoning gets.Seasoning your cookware:There are many discussions as to how to properly season cast iron. A recent post on lifehacker sums them up best. Basically what everyone agrees on is the vessel is covered in a layer of fat, and is put under high heat until the fat polymerizes. You let the pan cool, and repeat until you have multiple thin layers of polymerized fat. The discrepancies are what type of fat to use, the baking temp/time, and the best practices to maintain your seasoning.Traditionalists will argue that lard is best, because that's the way it always has been done. I've seasoned with bacon fat, and I'm a big fan of it. It satisfies the inner animal in me and makes me feel I'm cooking in the manliest way possible without putting a whole animal into a fire - not that I'm insecure about such things. I've also seasoned with vegetable oil, and found that it produces almost identical performance that lard does. The food science crowd suggests using flax seed oil, because it polymerizes easiest. I haven't had a chance to try seasoning with flax seed oil, but it's what I plan on doing after my next move in a few months. Another point to bring up, is that cast iron used to be offered polished and unpolished. The Lodge skillet comes unpolished, meaning it has a textured surface. I think before I do the flax seed oil seasoning, I will likely use a dremel/sandpaper to smooth the cooking surface purely for aesthetic purposes to flaunt that I take care of my cookware. Polished cast iron does offer the benefit of more exposed internal pores, so the seasoning sticks better, but I've never had an issue seasoning so this point is moot.I've done both high heat and medium heat for seasoning, and I find that the hotter the oven the better the seasoning. If you fail to season above 350f, you will likely end up with a browned pan that is slightly sticky because the fat didn't form a polymer, and will make you leave an unnecessary low star Amazon review and never know the benefits of cast iron. My suggestion is scrub the skillet with steel wool and soap until the water runs clear and you're sure there's no soap remaining on the cast iron. Dry the skillet completely, and cover with oil; make sure you get the handles, bottom, and top. Place a cookie sheet below the oven rack to catch any drips so you don't burn the house down. Heat the oven to 400f to 500f and put the skillet in there and bake for an hour - not including the preheating time. Putting it in a cold oven may be unnecessary, however this is the thermal shock downfall I mentioned earlier. It's better to get into the habit of avoiding massive temperature changes so you can pass the skillet down to your children's children. After the hour, shut off the oven and allow the skillet to cook down. This initial seasoning layer isn't quite ready for primetime, if you were to cook something with tomatoes, lemons, vinegar you could very well screw it all up because of the low PH reacting to the thin layer of fat polymer and possibly penetrating all the way to the cast iron. Too much science for me, so to be on the safe side if I'm going to be using the oven with temperatures in excess of 375f I make sure the cast iron gets another layer of fat and gets re-seasoned. Usually after about 3 or 4 trips to the oven, it could withstand just about anything.Now that you're seasoned, how do you not screw this up? First and foremost, I use metal utensils on it because it inevitably makes it easier to clean if stuff isn't stuck to it for very long. Providing you're not trying drill for oil through the pan, the polymer should be hard enough to not flake off and ruin your day. Next, make sure you invest in a large thing of salt. I don't think it's anything chemical about salt that allows it to clean the pan, but it's an edible scouring powder. I've read that because we generally don't use dish soaps that contain lye, they should be gentle enough to use on cast iron. I cannot confirm or deny this, because I find just using salt and a bit of oil to make a paste works just as well. Get a paper towel and polish down the dried bits of food until it resembles how it started. It may not have the same shine, but you should be completely drying the skillet and applying a real thin coat of oil to it. There's your shine. It's important to continuously use the skillet to maintain the coat. This doesn't mean every night, but treat yourself to a steak for dinner or pannekoeken for breakfast once a week - your skillet and taste buds will thank you.",Great cast iron skillet,Style: SkilletSize: 12-InchVerified Purchase,45 people found this helpful

It is 12 inches from rim to rim and the internal cooking surface is 10 inches.  There are a lot of different meals you can make right in the pan and it goes straight in the oven and the finished product is awesome.  I bake a whole chicken with 2 halves of a lemon inside  slathered in avocado oil sitting on top of sweet potatoes that are coated with avocado oil as well along with sea salt and pepper for both.  It comes out perfect every time.  My first homemade pan pizza came out perfect and super cheesy, notice in the side view how the cheese caramelizes on the sides.  It's also a quick and easy clean out, scrape off any food in the pan and use hot water and a regular brush to scrub out the pan.  Dry well and just add a touch of oil and spread it around, than wipe off the excess and it's ready for the next meal.  If your food sticks you may have to season your pan again which is easy to do.  Heat up your pan on a stove burner at medium/medium high and turn your oven to a temperature that's past the smoke point of the oil you are using, usually 450 or 500 degrees.  Once your pan is hot use an oven mitt so you can handle the pan, put some oil in the pan and carefully wipe it around the entire pan inside and out with folded paper towels, it will smoke some and that's fine.  Than grab a few more paper towels and fold them again so they are thick enough to where you don't burn your hand and wipe off all of the excess oil inside and out.  Than place the pan upside down in the oven for an hour, afterwards just shut the oven off and leave it in there to cool.  That's it.

I've had it for months now and have cooked all sorts of things in it but it's mainly been used to toast buns for burgers, make grilled cheese and quesadillas, and sear steaks.  I did make a deep dish pizza in it that turned our surprising well.It don't have any other iron skillets to compare it to, but my mother in law tells me this is seems like a good one for the price.  Personal observations is the skillet definitely gets hotter in the middle than on the sides.  I cook over a gas cooktop and while the skillet does distribute heat, it's not ever going to be a perfect distribution across the pan.  Cleanup is fairly simple.  In most cases I just scrape it out and wipe it down with some oil and a paper towel.  Get in the habit of cleaning the skillet while it's still warm (not hot) and it's a lot easier to clean and care for.The one thing I absolutely LOVE about this skillet is how well it works for grilling buns or sandwiches.

I have a 12-inch burner on my stove, and this skillet fits just right.  The 13.25 inch measure is across the top, and the sides slope inward so the bottom is 12 inches.  If you don't have a 12 inch burner, this is not the skillet for you - it will not heat properly on a smaller burner.

I took some 150 grit emery paper on a sanding block and sanded the bottom of the skillet for about 10 minutes.  I ended up with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dust that I washed out, then generously oiled the skillet.  The next time I used it, the bottom seemed smoother, but not completely smooth like my old Wagner ware.  My spatula no longer snags anywhere.  Because of the size and weight of this pan, I leave it on the stovetop most of the time.  If I have to move it, I put it on a rack next to the stove, so I don't take a chance of chipping my granite counter with it.  I have to lift it with both hands.

I'm looking forward to when we can have a party again, and plan to bake a humongous cornbread in it!  Bacon and sausage often leave residue stuck to the bottom, so to clean it I will pour in about a cup of water while it's hot,  then take it to the sink while still warm, and run hot water into it and scrub with a brush.  I put a dishcloth or dishtowel on the sink divider to protect it from scratches, and rest the skillet on that while washing.  No soap is needed most of the time.

You have a few options. You can strip it down and re-season it (This is my recommendation. I never like to trust the factory seasoning), you can just use it the correct way and it will eventually come out smooth as butter, or you can give up right then and there and send in a 1 star review.#1- Follow the steps to season your pan, but do some google research! There are people out there that have used these things for their whole lives, and their grandparents used the same ones before them. If you season it correctly and care for it correctly, your pan will never die.#2- Slow heat!! This one is very important! Don't turn your burner to medium-high, throw a pat of butter down and spread some pancake mix. In the words of the illustrious South Park ski instructor, ""You're gonna have a bad time"". Start your heat on low, let your pan warm up evenly and then start to cook on it.#3- Regardless of what people say, unless you're seasoning your pan, there's no need for soap. It won't necessarily hurt (Lodge even says specifically just to avoid high amounts or strong soap) but you don't need it. Run your water in your sink on hot, rinse the pan off, wipe it with a brush, use a stove burner on low to dry the pan and, if you want, put a very very thin layer of oil (crisco is my preference, just wipe off any excess oil after you apply the thin layer) on the pan and you're good to go for next time. You won't die from anything you previously cooked on the pan.#4- If your pan cracks or has an issue, contact Amazon/Lodge and they will replace it.. These things are prone to damage in transit simply because it's cast iron. This isn't some stainless steel pan coming in the mail. If you hit the pan against something or it gets damaged in transit, just ask for a replacement instead of posting a poor review. (On that note, these pans are ground on the edge due to the casting process. If your edge is a little rusty, scrub it with some steel wool, season it and you'll be cooking in no time.I'll stand by these pans. I've treated mine right and they've been the best pans I've ever owned.-----------------------------------------------------------------------As these reviews cover a variety of Lodge pan sizes, I'll post about all of the ones I have!I can't say enough how incredible cast iron pans are. They cook flawlessly, they clean up in under a minute and they're versatile! (I season them with a thin layer of Crisco and it works great every time).I use the 3.5 inch pan for eggs! A sliver of butter in the pan (while it's sitting in a larger pan for nice heat distribution and the ability to easily cover) on medium heat for a few minutes makes a great egg!The 6.5 and the 8 inch pans I use for a ton of different things but the tastiest thing is a nice warm skillet cookie!I use my 10.25 inch pan mainly for smaller single size dishes and (even better) pie!

My review is the same for both sizes!The first thing I did before using it was washing it in boiling hot water (no soap), and using a stainless steel scrubber. I then dried it and seasoned it by rubbing a generous coating of bacon fat all over the inside and out, placed it on a drip pan, then ""baked"" it in the oven for an hour at 475°F. I repeated this process every time I used it for the first few months, (mostly using coconut oil instead of bacon) and eventually it became slick and nonstick.This skillet allowed me to produce crispy crusts on apple pies, gorgeously brown crusts on corn bread, roasted vegetables, crispy fried chicken and roasted whole chickens, quiches, and delicious frittatas, to name a few.Unlike my experience with the Lodge Dutch Oven, there was no horrible metallic taste to foods and no rusting. The skillet is heavy duty, heats up, and retains heat well and was made in the United States.Overall I highly recommend Lodge's Cast Iron skillet in both sizes.

I didn’t use them very much at first because they were very heavy and frankly didn’t really know how to season or maintain them. However, after watching some seasoning videos, I feel like I have a new hobby. There is something about creating your own seasoning on these that add a personal touch to the cook ware and make you feel good when you watch stuff come off them with little to no stick. I like making omelettes on these because it cooks the eggs slowly. I tend to leave a mess when I flip omelettes but these cook more of the egg on top with out burning the bottom. I noticed a difference with using these for making pizza crust in the oven. I clean my pan by using a non abrasive sponge, water, wiping them dry, heating them in the stove to make sure they are super dry and oiling them. Seems to work to prevent rust and keeping it non stick. A little more work than normal nonstick but some people use theirs often enough that they don’t even wash them everyday and just wipe them. Sound gross you say? But apparently heating these to 300 degrees kills all the germs.Cons: they are heavy. So maneuvering and washing these are kind of a hassle.the handle is short and get super hot which can make taking them out of the oven kind of dangerous and difficult for a small wristed person with no upper body strength.

If you just take care of your cast iron, it will do you a great benefit.Cast Iron is really good for you in general, as you can cook using high heat and it won't release chemical fumes unlike using a teflon coated pan. You can also use metal utensils on cast iron when cooking, I would limit the use, but again no teflon chemical poisoning. It also cooks very evenly and distributes heat nicely, while aluminum pans may also do this, there is a lot going around about aluminum leaching into food while cooking, you should stick to anodize aluminum instead.Just do your research before you buy the cast iron, it's wonderful, and even better if you use induction cooktops.","I LoVE Cast Iron, I Love it",Style: SkilletSize: 8-InchVerified Purchase,11 people found this helpful

I've never owned a cast iron skillet before so I did some reading. I followed the tips that Lodge says to follow and it was pretty simple. The surface a two dings in it that were fairly deep. I'd say about 2mmx2mmx2mm so not huge. The surface isn't machined but it's already so much better than the many so-called ""non-stick"" skillets I've tried. Those eventually all failed horribly. The issue with this thing... I needed a better spatula because the eggs literally slid away! LolIt will need seasoned as the factory coating is just a starter. I used vegetable oil. Stuck it in the oven while it heated up to 500°. I let it sit at that temp for about 50 minutes and then turned off the oven. I left the skillet in there (door closed) for two plus hours ""cooling"". In quotes because man does it hold heat! I applied another coating as soon as I could handle the pan with a pot holder comfortably but while the pan was still fairly hot. Put it back in the oven and repeated that heat up /cool down process. The second time I let it cool completely in the oven over night. If you just remember to do every inch of the pan, super thin coatings of oil, and give it time - seasoning is pretty easy. :)",Great pan for the price,Style: SkilletSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

It heats evenly and quickly, and cleans up beautifully. The food doesn't stick to it at all.  I just seasoned it before using it the first time; and then, after each use, season it again with either olive or vegetable oil after washing and drying it. Seasoning, for those who are new to this, is just putting a small amount of oil inside the pan and spreading it around with a paper towel or napkin to give it a light coating...that's it.  The cast iron is fine on your Corelle cook top; it does not scratch or damage the cook top; I know because that is the cook top I have.  This 6-1/2 inch size is perfect for 1 or 2 eggs, a toasted cheese sandwich, a pork chop, etc., or for cooking and sauteing things to be added to other dishes you may be preparing.

I plan to buy another in the 10"" or larger size but will only buy the Lodge because it has proven to be great for me.  There is a hint of iron taste at first, but that is one of the reasons for an iron skillet - adding iron to your diet. That taste has dissipated with use, though, but you still have that iron added to your food.  Price: Amazon always has the best prices. I don't think this is returnable though. You may want to check that if you prefer that option.  At the price I paid as an add-on item of a little over $8, I wasn't concerned about that.

Freeze dried eggs simply don’t cut it.  That’s why I bought this little cast iron frying pan, because eggs need to be cooked on the spot.  As I will only need to prepare single servings for myself, this 6.5” size seemed to be the answer.So, I started by seasoning my new pan.Martha Stewart recommends using Crisco shortening to season the pan.  She says that a vegetable oil that is solid at room temperature works best, so, trusting Martha, that’s what I used.  Here’s how I did it.1) I thoroughly washed the new pan with hot water and dish washing detergent.2) Dried the pan thoroughly by wiping it off and then by placing it for several minutes in a preheated oven at 200°.3) Coated the pan thoroughly with Crisco (including the handle).4) Placed the pan upside down on the middle oven rack and heated it to 450° for one hour.5) Allowed the pan to cool down for one and a half hours.Now to cook an experimental breakfast!I have read reviews that eggs will stick!  (Extra cleaning chores are inconvenient on a camping trip)I decided to begin with two slices of Spam.The 6.5” pan size will hold exactly two slices of Spam……...so far, so good.And it cooked them just fine in a little margarine.Now for the eggs.I was curious to find out if the 6.5” size would handle 3 eggs; scrambled.A little more margarine into the pan, then pour them (pre-mixed up) into the pan.This little pan EASILY handles 3 eggs!And as I scrambled them in the pan I could see that the pan seasoning was doing it’s job very well.NO sticking!Excellent!Clean up was a breeze.Don’t wash cast iron in water!Just wipe it out and then re-oil it with a bit more Crisco.Bottomline; mission accomplished!This little cast iron skillet works perfectly for my intended purpose.

But I love to cook and like how certain foods turn out in cast iron.  So I gave cast iron one more try and purchased a 10-inch skillet.  I christened it with bacon and then hashbrowns. Crisp outside & tender inside of potatoes reminded me why cast iron is great. Seared steaks and even fried eggs, after I seasoned it a few more times.  It does require just a little special effort but it's not that bad really. I wash it with just a drop or 2 of liquid dish soap, with a soft brush. Rinse and DRY real well. I place it on hot burner for a few mins to make sure all moister evaporates. They pour a just a very little cooking oil or bacon grease on it, rub it on all sides with paper towel until there's just a very thin film, and then I place it in a hot 350 over for 30 mins and turn oven off.  it cools and sits in my oven till the next time I need it.  Just never let it sit in water or moisture, and follow the cleaning steps above, and it gets better each time you use it. After I had used it 3 times and seasoned each time afterwards, I fried eggs on it the 4th time. You want to make sure you always use enough fat or shortening and those eggs did not stick and came out great. Also, while it doesn't distribute heat evenly, it does hold heat.  So the trick is put your clean pan on the heat, wait till it's good and hot (a few drops water sizzle & evaporate right way and it is ready). Now lower your heat to your required setting, add enough oil/butter/shortening of choice, and cook your food.  Fantastic results.

Big selling point for me every time.  If you have a glass stove top (as we do) you must be careful not to drag or shake the pans on your stove top as the cast iron WILL scratch the glass.  Care is easy as well.  You can give it a quick scrub using cold water and then just wipe it out with a cloth or paper towel.  Never use soap on it.  Sometimes I'll put a tablespoon of kosher salt in the pan as a scrubbing agent.  Make sure to re-season it with oil (I use olive or avocado oil) before putting it away.

As for using the Egg Rings for Pancakes, our favorite server at our neighborhood restaurant told us that if we can't get the Real Restaurant Pancake Mix, use Sprite or 7-Up in the place of water, when we make our Pancake Mix. Not only will they have a sweet taste but they'll be nice and fluffy too. One more thing, if you like to cook outside on a grill over a log fire out on the pit, there's nothing around that beats a cast iron skillet.

Not everyone in the household is as an*l about caring for the pan so I’m going to be honest, I can see a slight silver of rust showing up.I honestly don’t think any rust would show up if you are very careful of caring for your pan as I’ve described above.  At least at this price, I don’t have to worry about it and it is well worth paying 1/10 the cost of an enameled pan which after reading lots of reviews, they simply don’t make them like they used to make them 30-40 years ago so why bother.The proof in the pudding is if we ended up passing these down to our grandkids or not! :D","at 1/10 the cost of enameled pans, it’s worth the spin!",Style: SkilletSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

But how to cook without drying them out?We Googled ""How to cook thick pork chops"" and came across several recipes. The main thing they all had in common was the use of cast iron.Basically, you pre-heat your oven to 425-450 degrees. Meanwhile. put your cast iron skillet on a stove-top burner set on high. Season your olive oil coated chops with Kosher salt (sea salt) and coarse ground pepper. Once the cast iron skillet begins to smoke, sear your chops on both sides (about 2 minutes per side).Immediately transfer the skillet (with chops) into you pre-heated oven. For 2"" chops we bake 5 minutes per side.That's all there is to it. Moist and delicious. Since then, we have followed the same process to lamb chops and fish...adjusting time in the oven.PS: If you make spaghetti  sauce from scratch, use a cast iron pot. Why?

This is the standard size (10.5 inch) and depth, great for frying, searing or baking.Cooking and Recipes: Most recipes call for a 10 or 12 inch pan. Definitely use the right size pan with your recipe, it should state what size you need. A 10 inch will hold three chicken breasts, 12 will hold four. Lodge skillets are a little more rough textured than other brands but they still work great and are affordable. I use bamboo utensils on my pans as those are soft enough but not easy to damage. Cast iron skillets work by retaining heat, you can cook on a MUCH lower temperature and attain a more even and quick cook. You also need to match the burner size to the pan size, if your burner is too big for the pan, the pan will not heat properly. You can fry or sear on the stove top and then pop this straight into the oven to bake. It's really a great way to make a one pan meal!Protection : Cast iron IS heavy, I can barely lift it with one hand, which is why this brand makes a helper handle on the opposite side. You need to make sure to use a pot holder for this pan, and leave the potholder ON the handle so that you don't accidently grab it while it is hot. You can make or buy cast iron handle covers that fit perfect. I've made my own :).Cleaning: Take your still warm (but not hot) cast iron and wipe it down with a paper towel to remove debris and oil. Rinse the pan out with warm water, use only a small amount of soap and make sure to wash it all out. You can use a soft sponge or a dish brush. I suggest a brush as sponges like to flake off on the pan's rougher surface. Just be gentle, it doesn't take much to get stuff off and you don't want to damage the surface. Dry the pan off with a towel and place onto a clean burner on medium until it is dry. This prevents rusting.Seasoning: After drying, put 1/2 teaspoon veggie oil in the pan and rub all over inside until it is black and shiny. I use a small tea towel to do this as it won't leave reside, but you can use a paper towel. Just be warned it will probably leave little bits of paper in your pan. You can use tongs to hold your towel if the pan is too hot. Your pan will still be warm, I pop mine into the unheated oven to cool down and stay clean. That's where my little cast iron lives now, in his little oven cave.",Happy :),Style: SkilletSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,45 people found this helpful

Will last for years too!So when I was a little kin in the Boy Scouts I still remember going on camping trips and we would have cast iron skillets and dutch ovens. I remember distinctly reading that the cast iron skillet had Lodge on the bottom and one of the troop leaders said that skillet has been with the troop for over 20 years! If you are just getting into cooking with cast iron skillets, its a game changer that's been around for years and years.I'm sticking with the old school style of treating this like many BBQ enthusiasts do: don't wash it! Clean it with water, scour off food and keep it seasoned when not in use. This thing is such a breeze to use, a breeze to clean, and its the best tool in my kitchen next to the wooden spoon. The heat distributes evenly so cooking with all sorts of food will be easy since there are no spots that heat better than others. Also, the surface is nice and roomy so I can fit a lot in it.Lodge will run into a problem eventually because this more or less is a one-time sale. I don't think I will need to buy another one for 20+ years. But I'll be getting them as gifts to my kids so they have a lifetime kitchen tool.

This is my first cast iron skillet, prior to this I had been using non-stick and stainless steel. Have to admit, I was always intimidated by cast iron because of the care it requires. Realized how wrong I was after cooking with it! I wanted to start making dishes that required stove top to oven cooking and had read that cast iron was perfect for just that. After doing some research, I decided on this one for the quality and affordability. First dish I made, I seared some meat and finished cooking it in the oven. Sidenote: I love how this process only uses one pan -- less to clean! I was initially worried that the meat was going to get stuck to the pan -- but it didn't! Produced the perfect sear that my previous skillets cannot even compete with and the meat turned out delicious! Next, I was concerned that it would be difficult to clean, since there was some bits burned and stuck on the bottom. When this happens in my stainless steel pan I'd have to soak and scrub and scrub...I was amazed when I only had to use a bit of water and some light scrubbing and rinsing to get it up. No soap needed! Took about a minute and the skillet looks just as good as brand new, can't even tell I used it, and it is still well seasoned. Which is another thing I'd like to remark on -- Lodge did a phenomenal job preseasoning! I can't wait to put this to regular use in my kitchen. Also, I used silicone oven mitts when cooking with this and it made it so much easier to transfer the pan, with the grip and the heat resistance.

It is sturdy and seems to heat evenly. I bought it because I wanted a pan that could easily transition from stove to oven or vis versa and could get a nice sear on meat.A lot of reviewers complained about rust, but that can easily be avoided with the proper care. First is to ensure you clean it quickly. I usually let mine cool down significantly, add some water and let it sit a minute before washing. Second is to not let it air dry. As soon as it has been washed, dry it with a towel! This is the biggest factor in getting rust. Once dried, rub it down with oil and either put in the oven or on the stove until the oil has begun dissipating. This will ensure the pan does not get sticky from excess oil.

Years ago, I relegated this skillet to storage because it was a bit overwhelming in my micro-kitchen with 'doll house'-size stove.  Anyway, moved to a new place with normal kitchen and rediscovered the skillet hiding in the back of the pantry.  I hadn't used it in about a year, and the cooking surface was completely covered with rust.  I asked the skillet for forgiveness, and my penance was a good long while of sandpaper-ing that rust out.  Once the rust was gone, I re-seasoned several times by wiping lightly with oil and baking in a 450 degree oven for about 30 minutes each cycle.  Came out looking like new!But now came the test - how would she cook?  I've picked up some more cooking wisdom over the years, and changed my pan frying skills a bit.  This seems to do the trick: preheat on MEDIUM-LOW to LOW heat with a teaspoon of oil, and it's ready to cook just about anything.  The skillet and I have finally come to an understanding, and the cooking surface is as slick as teflon.  Even cheesy scrambled eggs slide right out. After each time I use it, I wipe it out with paper towel/scraper/salt, maybe give it gentle clean with barely soapy water on cooking surface (yes, I'm in that camp), and towel dry thoroughly.  Then I put it back on burner over HIGH heat, and add another teaspoon of oil which I rub around the cooking surface with a wadded-up paper towel.  I leave the heat on until the oil in the pan BARELY starts to smoke, then shut off the heat and give the pan one more wipe with the clean side of that wadded-up paper towel.  Leaves the skillet looking show-room beautiful and ready for the next meal.Original Post:  I was so excited to get my first cast iron pan!  I've been trying to care for it exactly as the Lodge website (and most of these comments) suggests.The silicone handle is great - doesn't get too hot, and slides on and off easily.I've been cooking a lot of bacon in the pan to help with the seasoning, but sticking is still a bit of an issue (tried some hashbrowns the other day...didn't work so well).  I've also noticed that the bottom doesn't quite heat evenly, even after ""preheating"" before placing food on the pan.

I used a high smoke point olive oil, butter, and I rendered plenty of the fat from the steaks while searing. They came out great!

She clearly didn't know how to make proper scrambled eggs and burned them and MADE them stick to the skillet.

Additionally, make sure the skillet can fit in your sink to be washed. It may seem silly to stress this point but I forgot to measure my sink and lucked out in that the skillet fits, but with only an inch to spare! So far I love this versatile skillet and reach for it at every opportunity. It is roomy enough to put a great sear on a large roast, the sides are tall enough to deep fry chicken, you can make gravy, beautifully caramelize onions, whip up a party-sized batch of cornbread, and the list goes on. I've had absolutely no problem cleaning the skillet. Let it cool completely so that it's safe to handle, pour any remaining oil into an appropriate container, and use a pan scraper to remove as much residue as possible. To avoid damaging your sink, especially if it's enamel, line it with kitchen towels and then transfer the skillet to it. Fill the skillet with very hot water and let rest for a few minutes to soften stuck-on food before using a scraper or non-abrasive scrub brush. Pour out the water and repeat the process as necessary. Give a final rinse and  thoroughly dry with a lint-free cloth. Moisten a paper towel with some cooking oil and apply a light coating to the skillet before storing it in a dry location.

These were shipped together in the same box, too, even though they were ordered in different orders at different times, which was surprising.  I don’t know if cast iron pans can be damaged by clanging together in a box.  Since it’s such a heavy material, I feel the pans should have been ok.

It's almost impossible not to burn the pan as it doesn't distribute heat well enough. There is a trick you can do with oil to prep them that works well, but it of course takes more time and the underside of the pan will still burn and have to be cleaned. I switched to the anodized, which works better in comparison with no prep needed. However, the cast iron is a step beyond. It heats just as you would expect and is a great even cook and takes less heat to get results. The only minimal challenges are:1) you need a pot holder or sleeve for the handle, it gets real hot.2) you need a pot holder square glove to store it if you plan to hike after, as it will still be hot.3) the weight, but the 3.5 inch is quite lite and if you have ultra-light gear already, this is not much of an impact.These three things are fine with me for the cooking results. Thus far, I've test cooked drop-biscuits, eggs, cookies and fish cakes, all with amazing results (see pictures). I'm cooking with isobutane on an MSR pocket rocket.

I always had some good memories with Lodge...grandma's pancakes, a hearty stew cooking in a Ben Franklin wood burning stove and so on...  I love my Le Creuset (the only enameled cast iron I'll buy), but I have been wanting to bring back some old family recipes, prepared in their traditional way...with Lodge...still made in the USA...I had to get some pieces.I've always hated nonstick, Teflon coated and the like cookware.  I even tried enamel over metal pans...they work ok, but I like cooking with fats and oils...and that tends to make the enameled layer not so nonstick and the flavors just aren't right.  So, back to Lodge...I almost forgot how inexpensive and easy these are to care for.  I  started with this 10.25"" skillet.  It was easy to clean with mild soap before use.  I did a quick seasoning (although it is pre-seasoned well) with an organic cast iron oil...super easy!My first ""dish"" made in this was a custardy French toast for my daughter and I.  The heat was easy to attain, and our French toast cooked evenly and to perfection.  --Absolutely no sticking.  I seriously wasn't expecting nonstick effect upon first use!!!  The butter and coconut oil I used melted beautifully...no scorching and the oils were evenly distributed in the dish, while cooking.  I was also able to use stainless steel utensils without fear.  I've always made a good French toast, but this batch was my best yet.  The egg mixture that overflowed and surrounded the toast was delicate and fluffy (as it should be)...not the hardened crispy fried egg effect (gross).The most beautiful part of our experience with this Lodge fry pan....clean up...everything wiped out with just a simple paper towel, mild soap and water wash, then quick seasoning on the stove, wipe out excess, put away.  This seriously is the best no frills, no stress, ""no need to sacrifice or skimp on flavor"" and ""healthy for you"" nonstick cookware...and it's just about as inexpensive as the throw away, unhealthy nonstick cookware at your local discount store.What I love about Lodge cast iron...it can be put on a campfire, grill, wood burning stove or firepit and still keep it's appearance with simple care (no worries over pretty enamel getting ugly or metals losing it's shine or luster) and STILL be able to use it on the stove or in the oven...no warping.  It's an inexpensive investment that I'll be able to pass down; along with my more expensive investments like Le Creuset, All Clad and Mauviel.  I also love that Lodge cast iron is made in Tennessee, USA.  (*their enameled items are made in China)  It's not ""beautiful"", but I love incorporating it's rawness with the beautiful...nice balance in a functional kitchen.I also purchased the 5qt Lodge Dutch Oven   Lodge L8DO3 Cast Iron Dutch Oven, Pre-Seasoned, 5-Quart          .  --The lid fits my 10.25"" fry pan perfectly, and I don't need to spend $20+ for a special fitting lid.

I used it the next day, and it perfectly cooked a fried egg with limited sticking (cast iron gets more stick-free the more you use it). I was able to flip the egg without any problem (and with a metal turner/spatula!). And it should get even better over time.Cleaning was easy. I used hot water and a little soap (no, soap doesn't 'remove' the seasoning--seasoning polymerizes the oil and it adheres to the surface). Lodge says you can use soap if you want with no harm. Then I completely dried it off (cast iron will rust!) and reseasoned it (it's always a good idea).I used cast iron decades ago, but for some reason stopped--not because of any problems. I always enjoyed the non-stick qualities, rugged durability, and easy cleaning.Keep in mind, these cast-iron pans are HEAVY. If you're used to stainless steel or aluminum, you're in for a change!

I've used most cookware, aside from copper and nothing I've tried comes close to providing the searing/browning ability of these cast iron skillets. Meat, roasted vegetables and stir-frys excel in these pans and the ability to go from stove-top to oven makes them even more versatile.But there are some drawbacks: they are quite heavy and somewhat high maintenance (ex. you can't throw in sink to clean the next morning, you're better off just leaving it on the stove then washing when you're able). They have to be completely dried after rinsing. Eggs are a challenge until it's very well seasoned and even then I don't think I'd use cast iron (I'm not down with brown eggs anyway). Acidic and tomato based items can also absorb the flavors of the pan and ""un-season"" it, making those types of food undesirable to use with these.And anyone complaining about serious sticking probably needs to revisit basic cooking science...the pan has to be preheated hot and what's going into the pan should patted dry and brought to room temperature, NOT directly out of the refrigerator cold. Also: you have to let things be. For instance, a steak (or whatever you're searing/browning should only be flipped once and it will become way easier to flip when the temperature of the pan and the food become close to the same",Best pan for high heat searing and roasting,Style: SkilletSize: 8-InchVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

I've had the pan about a week now and love everything about it.As a first time cast iron user I read a lot of the reviews here and seasoned it in the ""cathartic"" method (nice review bud!) - heated the pan, rubbed it down with oil and then let it preheat in the oven @ 475, left it for an hour after it preheated and then shut off the oven, left it in there until cool.  Did this three times over a couple days, got a lovely black sheen.  I even ""messed up"" the first time, using too much oil and too little time - to help anyone else who makes the same mistake if you end up with a ""tacky"" pan, simply lightly oil it again and bake it off in the oven just as if you were seasoning - came out perfect!As far as cooking goes - I've had a blast using it.  My first ever meal was steak and cheese - got that nice hard crispy brown ""steak shop"" crust on the shaved steak, delicious!  Next up was attempting a filet and ribeye - again awesome hard brown (not burned!) sear on the exterior and perfect medium / midrare on both (filet went in first, ribeye shortly after).  The last thing was an omelet.  With all this, I've heated up the pan on medium low, added in fat after smoking then added in whatever I was cooking... and it's come out perfectly.  The omelet floated right up above the bacon fat and slid right out of the pan when done!  Awesome!One thing I was worried about was cleaning - knowing I can't use soap and fearful there'd be tons of grit on the bottom had me thinking post-dinner cleanup would be a pain - but it's been so simple.  There's very little stuck to the pan (even the omelet left only a small amount of egg) and the stainless steel ""chainmail"" scrubber I bought with the pan works wonders.  It hasn't been a chore to clean at all, and it was something I was worried about (would the pan never hit the stove if it was a 30 minute process to clean after cooking, eating, dishes, etc?).  Instead, it's almost fun to go through the ritual of scrub, dry, heat and oil (yes I heat the pan after cleaning then rub it down with a tiny bit of oil).So, overall this thing is a bit like a kitchen gremlin, what with all the initial rules and such... but the results are fantastic so far.

This is perfect when cooking for one.  The texture is rough and it does come pre-seasoned.  HOWEVER -YOU MUST SEASON FURTHER!!!!  Cast iron rusts easily, so take the time to re-season a few more times.  Easiest by far is to ALWAYS leave a teaspoon or two of your favorite oil in the skillet, and leave the skillet on the stove.  Heat up your skillet before using with the oil, and it will naturally season itself over time.  The other option is to do 3 or 4 coats of seasoning by placing a light layer of oil, baking the skillet at 350 or 400 degrees for an hour or two, let it cool and repeat.About the rough texture; after seasoning further, it does not cause any problems.  It still becomes non-stick.  We use metal utensils on it, and over time our larger skillet has become very smooth, but there is no difference in non-stick ability.If you have an electric stove - BE CAREFUL - Iron skillets will warp if you leave them on ""high"" for more than a few minutes.

A sturdy, solid, cast iron skillet. The only things that could be slightly improved: the handle of the skillet is a little shorter than I was anticipating, which means it's sometimes difficult to get good leverage on the pan (especially when hot) and the skillet is really heavy. I would personally have preferred a slightly longer handle / lever to make gripping / lifting / tilting a little easier on the wrist.

Stick-free pans are a no-brainer; put in some olive oil and cook.Cast iron requires some skill and attention. You have to maintain a seasoned, oiled pan; you must preheat; and you must know how to cook your food. With a non-stick pan, you throw in the food, play with the heat all you want and out it comes. Not so with cast iron. For eggs, you need just the right temp, not too cold and not too hot. Too cold and your eggs with stick as they eventually cook. Too hot and they will stick when they hit. Not hard to do if you know what you're doing.Ditto large skillets and other foods like breaded chicken cutlets and meatballs where you want some browning and want the brown bits to stay on your food.Best practice is to use these skillets a lot so they build up a good oily seasoned skin.They are much heavier than non-stick so not for old folks with wrist and elbow issues. You need a pad in the sink to wash otherwise you will scuff up the sink, especially white sinks. You cannot hold the large skillet and wash with the other hand.Definitely buy the rubber pot handles. The handles get too hot to use when cooking. Get two or three if you do major cooking with multiple skillets going.Also buy stock in a vegetable oil company. You will be using lots more to season the skillets. Lots more.",Great for eggs,Style: SkilletSize: 8-InchVerified Purchase,

You do have to let cast iron warm up before you add oil or whatever you are cooking, but when I follow that procedure I get perfect eggs (that have little to know sticking) every time!  Then as soon as the food is done (while the pan is still hot) I run very hot tap water over the pan and give it a scrub either with my non scratch scrubbies, my stainless steel chain mail, or with a sturdy brush.  After its clean I dry it thoroughly, then I put it back on the stove on medium heat until the rim of the skillet is hot (this way it has time to dry completely) then I apply a thin layer of grapeseed oil all over the inside surface (I've been using a bandana to do the job) then I use a clean portion of the lint free cloth or some paper towels to remove any excess oil that was not absorbed by the pan (otherwise the surface will become sticky) then I just let the pan cool completely while it sits on the stove before I put it away.

Because of that it is a challenge to handle when cleaning or storing. The bottom surface is more like a griddle because it is so large and flat.

It is a good size to cook three ribeye steaks, though.I've used it to cook fried eggs and oven-seared steaks.I love that this skillet is preseasoned. You DO NOT need to season this skillet when you first start to use it. If it needs seasoning later, just put a little oil and heat in a 500 degF oven until thoroughly heated. Wipe out and repeat as desired. The cooking surface may seem ""rough"" but, as other reviewers have noted, really the ""peaks"" keeps eggs from sticking as they would to a completely smooth surface. Lodge knows what they are doing.I DO clean it with a LITTLE dish soap, then dry on medium high heat for a few minutes. When cool, I wipe olive or vegetable oil on a paper towel throughout the interior.One caveat -- it is very large and heavy.

It's absolutely beautiful. I'm transitioning to all nontoxic items in the kitchen, so I chose cast iron because it's so safe. There is a learning curve with cast iron. It has to be seasoned-which means you coat it with a healthy oil and buildup a layer of protective coating to prevent sticking. You can bake it in the oven between coats if you want to. It's perfectly fine to just wash this with a little soap and water, dry it, and re season it when it arrives. I've made eggs, rice, veggies, meat and casseroles in it so far. Things will stick at times-it just depends on the seasoning. It will take some getting used to, but it's worth it. Seasoning and caring for the pan is simple, but does take effort and patience. Once you're accustomed to it, it's easy. The food tastes great, and I love the peace of mind of it being a healthy cookware item.Just a heads up: okra turns black in cast iron (it looks weird, and you won't want to eat it), and cooking acidic foods like tomatoes will leach more iron than usual into the food and it might taste more metalic, unless really well seasoned.

As a mid-line, no frill, non-fancy-work-horse case iron product maker, Lodge does it very well.  If you are looking for a solid cast iron without all the bells and whistles and you are going for best bottom line (dollar wise), Lodge is the way to go.  This is not your enamel cast iron.  This is not your French ferrous iron.  This is good ol'e American standard that will last you 3 generations.

The factory seasoning will last about 3-4 cooking and it will wear off.  Then apply own seasoning and continuously season with every cooking session.  Many youtube videos on how to season a cast iron pan.Now, I just came across a video about using soap on cast iron and I had been pleasantly surprised.  Yes, you can use soap on cast iron ( a little bit of soap and gentle wash).  Look for that video as well.  Spoiler:  basically a proper seasoning is polymerization of oil onto metal.  You all have burned oil/grease on your pots and pans that don't come off despite soap and hard scrubbing, right?  Well, if it is that difficult to get that stuff off, why do you think we continue the old saying you can't use soap on cast iron?  Why wouldn't the soap dissolve the grease right off that pots and pans you spent hours cleaning?  Hmmmm.  Think about that for a little bit.So, watch that video.  You can find it on you tube.  Anyway, I have been using a light soap and it's been fine.  Nothing is happening to the seasoning.  MAKE SURE YOUR SEASONING IS CORRECT.  You want that same layer of oil film that sticks to your pot that doesn't want to come off.  Then the soap you use to wash off food won't wash off that seasoning.  Same concept.Anyway, for the $$-- a great purchase!","No frill, no joke; good ole American standard quality that will last.",Style: SkilletSize: 10.25-InchVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Next day made a pan of southern corn bread. Poured the batter in a hot bacon greased pan and tossed it in the oven. WOW! The best cornbread ever, and it slid right out of the pan! I’m excited to try other things. I guess the key to good results is knowing how to use the pan correctly. Watch some videos if you’ve never cooked in cast iron.

I did my due diligence and read up on how to use and care for a iron pan, and to be honest, it is no worse than taking care of any other pan. It cleans up super easily, and after a few uses, it has proven to be just about as non-stick as any of my non-stick pans, but cooks better, more evenly, browns nicely, and cleanup is a breeze. I clean it like any other pan, with some mild dish soap and a plastic scrub, dry it, then apply a very light coat of oil before storing it. That's it. No magic.

The 8-inch is VERY small, but it's perfect for searing meat or cooking small portions of something in a pan that you don't have to baby with gentle sponges and nylon utensils. It's very sturdy, very heavy, and retains heat extremely well. And since it's cast iron, you can scrape metal utensils over it all day and, short of annoying the heck out of your significant other, it won't be any worse for the wear.The only big ding I can give it, and the reason for 4 stars instead of the perfect 5, is that the ""pre-seasoned"" label was an absolute lie. When I first got it I tested it with an egg (which I didn't expect to work particularly well anyway), and it was an absolute disaster. After I managed to get all of it cleaned off, I decided to try a pork cutlet instead, and it was also a disaster. Completely stuck to the bottom and requiring a lot of scraping to get unstuck (and then flipped and stuck again).Once I realized that the ""pre-seasoning"" was either not done or just terribly done, I spent an afternoon seasoning it 4 times in a row in the oven. Total time was about 5 hours, but ""my"" time was about 5 minutes. Wipe some oil on it, put it in the oven for an hour, let it cool. Wipe some more oil on, another hour in the oven, repeat.Lodge has very good instructions for seasoning it on their website so I had no trouble at all. And while 4 seasonings back-to-back may have been a bit overkill, I'm happy to say that after months of use and abuse this thing is still holding up like a champ. I use a ""chainmail"" scrubber to get stuck on bits off, the scratchy side of a sponge for softer things, and *gasp* even the occasional dash of *soap*! And yet it just keeps on working flawlessly with no need to re-season it.Just don't leave it sitting out wet, and don't put it in the dishwasher, and you should be fine for years.",This has very quickly become my favorite skillet.
