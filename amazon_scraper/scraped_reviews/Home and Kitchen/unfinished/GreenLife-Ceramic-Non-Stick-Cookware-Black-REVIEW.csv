These are very pretty and the silicone handles are useful when cooking on gas stove. The small fry pan and medium fry pan have stained and no matter what effort I make on cleaning these with soft cleaning agents (as recommended by the manufacturer) and gentle elbow grease the stains are there to stay. Like I said I followed the directions on the packaging. The large fry pan and other deep dish, medium fry pan have not stained. What I don't understand is that when using them on the stove top one must use low to medium heat. However, these are made to withstand temperatures in the oven. Huh? Inside the middle and bottom portion of the medium pot got burned and dry crusted when I accidentally let it dry up during a steaming of vegetables. That was able to be cleaned easily. No stains. I don't use a lot of oils in cooking either so I don't know if there were manufacture issues in the 2 that stained or what. I have another big grey fry pan manufactured by the same company that was given to me which triggered me to buy this brand and type in a complete set of red with the silicon handles. The grey fry pan has stained also on a small section of it if you look closely. I cook a lot of vegetables and I'm not sure if the bottled garlic is bad for these pans or if its something else. When they don't stain they're awesome easy to clean! The red tint on the outside of the pan is easily scratched if bumped against something a little more rough, like the protective grid plates around the gas burners on the stove top.","Pretty Pans, STAINS Easily",Color: RedStyle: Cookware SetVerified Purchase,76 people found this helpful

Those that complain about it being difficult to clean, ceramic is a low/medium heat only, and my guess is they cranked that heat up and ruined the pan. Since then my dad has transferred over to this set upon my  request in the red color, and he absolutely LOVES the easy cleaning of this pan and the non-stick properties. My boyfriend, who barely had any cookware and it was driving me nuts is the most recent addition to my conversion. I asked him to buy the set in navy (I tried convincing him to do pink but for whatever reason he wouldn't have it....) and he loves them as well. As with anything sometimes people are going to have problems, but I can confidently support this product as I've seen it used many times, in many situations, on different stove-tops, and it's always maintained a high quality and exceeded my expectations of such an affordable set!","I have a set, my dad has a set, my boyfriend has a set...

Pros and cons.  Be careful. The edges are sharp - as if the metal was just cut & not buffed before turned into a pan. My friend cut her finger hand-washing them.Description says dishwasher safe, but label warns that the dishwasher removes the non-stick! Must be hand-washed immediately after each use or the bottom stays brown, and gets darker with each use. The non-stick surface scratches very easily. Plus side- They are really easy to clean, can even use a paper towel! They do distrubute heat evenly, and the pan heats quickly. Fried eggs really do slip right out of the pan! Great for minor cooking, like eggs, grilled cheese, steamed veggies, etc. Thin metal makes them light weight!  Color is a true, soft pink. (That makes it totally worth it!)Bottomline: If non-toxic is important to you & really want pink pots and pans (I did!) & if you don't mind carefully hand-washing, (sharp ""lip"") & don't expect them to last forever, these are terrific for the price. Hard to find a true non-toxic, non-stick set for under $100.

This set was in my top three and I went with it over the others because of the pretty teal color. [Which isn't the best way to make a decision, but I am a sucker for aesthetic and it matched the rest of my kitchen stuff]Anyway, I held off on writing a review for several months just to make sure I was giving them a fair shake, and now I am coming to tell you all: these pans are THE best pans I have EVER owned!The care is easy--let them cool before washing, use a soft nylon scrubber or your hand, and if there is anything stubborn on the on the outside of the pan you use a magic eraser very lightly to remove it. I have always handwashed my pans, so that wasn't an issue. I was worried about staining, but I have fried in these, cooked curry, tomato sauce, and other kinds of foods known to stain, but they have cleaned up beautifully, even after sitting out overnight!I only have one minor gripe, and that is that my smallest fry pan came with a chip off the interior side due to back packaging [it was struck by another pan] but since it is so high up the side I use it anyway and it cleans up just as well as the others. I use less oil and butter when I cook, and I am able to use high heat on my electric glass cooktop occasionally without any issue. None of the included tools scratch or melt, and the handles stay nice and cool. I am glad I bought them despite the few bad reviews I read about catching fire, burning, melting, etc.I love these pans. Seriously. I plan to buy a larger saute pan to complete the set since the included one is slightly small for what I like to use it for.

They have smooth inner surfaces (no bumps where the screws hold the handle on) so they're even easier to clean because there's nowhere for food to get caught. Plus they're gorgeous. My only complaint is that the stock pot is only 5 quarts instead of 6, definitely not enough room to make a family-sized soup or stew. But luckily my old stockpot from my Teflon set was in good enough shape to keep and the colors coordinate well.

If you can afford to replace them every couple of months, then by all means. This is the set for you. If you're looking for that really great set that will last you a few years... keep on looking. Bought these in May, they went to poop by August. We were so extremely careful to follow all of the instructions for heating and cooling them down properly and cleaning them... never used harsh cleaners, never used abrasive surfaces. One pan we've only ever boiled water in for pasta and they all turn out the same. Whatever coating on them that makes them amazing for a minute seems to fade quickly despite best efforts and stuff sticks to the bottoms and stains them something really really terrible. Our biggest frying pan is completely brown on the bottom, but super smooth to the touch!

Lots of chips and scrapes. We never use metal utensils on them and do our best to store them safely. Really disappointed in the durability of the coating.The saute pans have become stained, likely from using oil and butter to cook with, which after some research seems to be a common problem with ceramic coatings, especially when using high heat. We use medium heat for most of our cooking, and it seems that shouldn't cause the type of damage these have.The sauce pans and larger stock pots are great for boiling water and cooking vegetables, pastas, and other low-impact cooking.

I have a small electric stove/range (coil inserts for the cooktop) and wanted to find a nice set of kitchen cookware that would be easy to clean, be durable and somewhat scratch resistant, while delivering even heat  preparing small to large size meals. I test drove this cookware set for yesterday for Thanksgiving, and each piece performed perfectly.  My main go-to is my cast iron cookware - but in my opinion, if you want to achieve slow cooker results, in taste, texture, appearance and full bodied flavor of what you will prepare - and excellent stove top results to boot - this wonderful set of pots and pans is ideal and a necessity in my and in any kitchen.The Trick is to NOT overheat the pots/pans that you chose to use. Slow and even medium heat applied is where this cookware really shines! I completely agree with the many reviews that strongly suggest low to medium heat to cook, and the manufacturer, Green Life has stated on the care and use guide enclosed with the set. It is normal that the non stick properties will diminish significantly due to prolonged exposure to high heat applied during cooking, especially when the prolonged use is from cooking oils which begin the breakdown into the carbonization process. This measure alone rapidly accelerates into severely damaging the ceramic finish and the aluminum double plate heating system on the bottom. I prepared a number of dishes, and chose to deep fry crab Rangoon implementing the 5 quart pot. The oil heated quickly over medium heat (the number 6 setting on my stove dial) and the Rangoon browned beautifully; very light and crispy. No oily touch or cold oil residue tastes. Systemic great design - the heating and ceramic coating mechanism performs very well!  I found I had always even heat -  quick, even and adjustable when needed to be -resulting in fabulous results in whatever you may choose to prepare. Sautee and stir frying works exceptionally well, and preparing tomato or non tomato based dishes (red and white varieties) were perfect. Great results! If you can use butter or a light oil in small application - that is on the mark!The set has a nice selection of sizes for the skillets and pots and pans. The smallest skillet is a perfect fit for a mini omelet or one fried egg wonder - The mini omelet in this little champ was pleasantly surprising - and also performed well when doing a mini crepe.Please be sure to allow adequate cooling of the cookware BEFORE you clean them. A simple wipe down with a soft clean cotton cloth or pre-crumpled paper towels to ""tenderize"" the coarseness of the towel before you hand wash them. There is a limited 2 year warranty, but with some TLC , this cook wear set will last a long, long time and have a wonderful extended life.The set comes with recommended utensils to prevent scratching and damaging of the ceramic surfaces. The glass lids and well balanced and have a great weight to them. In my opinion, the glass appears and performs as heavy duty, (though I would have liked to have had a port/vent in each lid to release steam). The heat resistant handles are a big plus in addition.I would NOT recommend oven use, as you would jeopardize and compromise the heat resistant handles, the heating plate technology, etc. in their construction and design. This set is ideal for non professional use and low to medium heat applications. Each piece well performed to the conditions /variables I have applied thus far. Stay away from dishwashers (in my opinion). I treat this set of cook wear as I do my cast iron - and it will and has paid off beautifully!I am only an intermediate experienced cook, but this cookware set is perfect and ideal for the paces I put it through.

A lot of other people suffered the same issue.  At least I got my money back.  Sad, because it was a pretty set and I loved the non-stick and healthy PFOA AND PTFE free features.I bought this cookware set (in Dec. 2018) in hopes of cooking healthier.  I did my homework, did my research, and this brand name came HIGHLY rated as being in the Top 5 ceramic cookware on the entire internet.  So I ordered me a set.  When I got it, the pots and pans looked like they were sized for children; very small...not even standard sized.  The product page listed it's features to sound like it was a normal sized cookware.  But the negatives don't end there.  I overlooked the size and cooked in them (starting in March 2019).  So first I boiled one simple egg in water.  The pot (as you can see in my pics) started to catch on fire!!!  I have a gas stove, but the flame was UNDER the pot, not licking up the sides of the pot, yet it still almost caught fire.  I contacted this manufacturer, GreenLife, and the representative, Jeanne, didn't seem to care too much to contact me back right away.  I emailed her pictures of the damage and she responded several days later saying they would not honor the warranty (my set was only a little over 3 mons. old and had only been used once).  She directly blamed me for having my flame too high where it went on the outside of the pot touching the pot handle.  She was not there!! I was!!! I know what I did, but for this manufacturer to not honor a warranty replacement on defective materials and workmanship has left me shocked.  I can't use it now or it will catch my kitchen on fire!  It's trash.  I was simply boiling an egg!!!!...on medium heat!!!....with the flame contained under the pot!! I'm just shaking my head at the absurdity of this manufacturer.  I wish I had read ALL the 1 star reviews before I purchased this.  I feel like such a fool now for not listening to them.  Proof is in the pictures and use of the pots.  If you purchase this set, be ready to squabble with the manufacturer who is acting like a scammer, scamming money out of buyers by not honoring their own warranty, and the buyer gets stuck with defective pots and pans.  Buy at your own risk.  Maybe I can use it as a pretty flowerPOT outside.  Oh, and by the way, they scratch VERRRRRY easily.  The finish on these will not last a week.  I found several scratches on the bottom of the pots where they'd slid around on the burner grate.  Just ate up the finish.  Horrible finish.  The only positive thing I can say is: Pretty color and I love the ceramic coating.  I will find those features on another brand however.",VERY poor quality of materials and workmanship!,Color: LavendarStyle: Cookware SetVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Let me start by saying this: people who left the reviews about their things burning up and sticking don't know how to cook. They are either overcooking or undercooking... or God knows what but that's... whatever. Don't listen to them. If you, person that's reading this review, actually know how to cook or hopefully are learning to cook I want to tell you I use them everyday and I mean it when I say Every. Single. Day. and these are sturdy cooking ware I can say they really do their job just fine. My food doesn't stick and it always has a great taste. I waited to see a few months before leaving this review just to see if I see any fading (which is completely normal in all of the cooking items) and nothing has happened. The only thing that I do not recommend to cook in any nonstick cookware is rice (advise from a Caribbean that cooks rice pretty often).You are obviously not supposed to use metal against them because it'll scratch them. I thought that was common sense but some people here just need to read it. It happens with all of the nonstick cookware that if you use metal against the pan it will scratch off the nonstick ceramic. Use wood, sturdy rubber or silicone cooking utensils; preferably wood. Also the color pink is pretty and it matches my all white and pink kitchen. If you want an overall comparison it's similar to the Tasty pink pot that Walmart sells.",Pretty and great!,Color: PinkStyle: Cookware SetVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

After the mixed reviews, I have decided to be deliberate in my use and care for these and really give them a good review after using them the way they are designed.Day 1, I washed them in the dishwasher and put them in the pots/pans cabinet. The pans fit together strangely in that the handles seem to be placed in a way that doesn't allow for the most efficient usage of space when stacking.After the first wash, I have hand washed the pots/pans with a non-scratch dish wand and dawn. I am mindful of the finish when I'm washing them and endeavor to not scrub more than I have to. So far, I haven't really cooked anything that needed me to really apply much force when scrubbing. I have noticed a few discolorations on the outside of the bottom of one of the pans, it seems to just be a blemish of the paint, I don't see metal or anything yet so I don't know if it's from a scratch or what.The silicone handles are a pain! These pots and pans specifically say they are rated to be used on gas stoves but these handles are sensitive to open flame. Like all silicone handles, if you just place the pan on the heat and don't take care to notice that sometimes the flame licks up the side of the pan, your handle will become discolored and bubble. This is not a fault of the mfg. necessarily, just something that gas stove users tend to forget, especially when switching to silicone cookware from metal. I wish there was a way to send them back in to be replaced or a replacement part could be purchased... One handle is now a little charred and no longer lavender. Sad.I mostly poach fish in the pans and haven't really had any bad ""burnt on"" scenarios, or times where it looks like the finish has been damaged.Will write more in the coming months of use.",So far so good,Color: LavendarStyle: Cookware SetVerified Purchase,

Also it's dissapointing that it comes with plastic cooking utensils...with the brand being focused on eco friendly products they should have included eco friendly non toxic cooking utensils as well.*Update after almost 2 years of use*Do not put these in your dishwasher unless you want the non stick ability to go away as well as chipping in the pan to occur. Also do not heat them above medium heat as that could also cause the enamel to chip and it will heat the handles to where they give off a very bad chemical smell and they'll get hot. Must use on a burner that is not larger than the pot or pan you are using otherwise the heated handle becomes an issue.

I was only cooking at 350¬∞, so no idea what caused that. The skillet was stained after the first use, no amount of hand scrubbing gets it clean, and frankly I bought these on the promise of them being dishwasher safe.

However I don‚Äôt know what it was about these pans but it constantly burns whatever I cooked. Sometimes I would switch pans midway cooking a dish and I would have the same results even on a lower heat. To say that these are non-stick is an absolute joke.

These are great and easy to clean. Non stick as well. Accidentally left rice in a pot playing video games and all the water boiled out. Didnt burn the rice or stick to the pot so im convinced these are the best set of pots and pans i got.,Should've been had these.,Color: TurquoiseStyle: Cookware SetVerified Purchase,

They get hot fast, super easy to clean and the ceramic coating works amazingly well. BE CAREFUL WITH THE HANDLES THOUGH, those are not heat resistant and if it‚Äôs super close to the flame, they‚Äôll start to turn black. Just keep the handle part away from the middle of the stove and you should be good. The color is still lovely too!",Cute and Amazing,Color: LavendarStyle: Cookware SetVerified Purchase,

Read mixed reviews before buying but took the chance and am SO glad I did! They clean SUPER easy, food just slides off with warm water and the soft side of a sponge. They cook so quick, the pan heats evenly and fully on 4/5. I have not gone above a 5 heat setting with these, even for boiling pasta water! It‚Äôs just not needed. Definitely would recommend to anybody. They are an amazing product, and an amazing deal at the price they are listed.",AMAZING PRODUCT!,Color: Black & CreamStyle: Cookware SetVerified Purchase,

Great!!! meaning full nonstick. Then I washed the pans. too my suprise water did not stick to the inside of the pan. I wipe it with a paper tower and the paper was not wet. Sweet!!!! I cooked a slice of cheese in it, it did not stick. I cooked gravy in it and let it dry in the pan over night. I was able to move the dried up gravy ith my finger. Now I just want to see how long the nonstick last. But for the price if they last 4 years super. the last more expense $500 set i bought only lasted about 3 years of heavy daily use.
