At about $7 per bottle though, it was costing me more to buy it that way rather than brewing my own hot coffee and adding ice. It wasn't until I was perusing YouTube and saw one of my favorite YT'ers pouring her own cold-brew out of a refrigerated container. I immediately toggled to Amazon in a search for one similar and I found this product. After comparing prices and reviews, I decided to give this one a try. 3 weeks and several brews later here are my takeaways:Pros: Easy to clean and use, coffee tastes great, not going back to buying pre-made!Cons: Durability seems fragile as the soft foamy plastic on the handle is coming up already, it will leak if you don't screw the lid on tight so beware, since it has to brew laying down it takes up more space in my small fridge than I'd likeOverall though, it's a much cheaper alternative to pre made cold brews and you can control the strength and taste of your coffee by selecting the brand/grounds/roast you want and by adding more or less ground to the filter.Special Note: I read through a lot of reviews and it seems the main issue most people had was the coffee grounds seeping into the liquid. It appears from reading the replies from the manufacturer and by my own experience with this, that they have created a smaller mesh filter and have stopped shipping the product with the old style. The new style is so good that I'm using fine ground coffee and have had NO grounds in my end product. So please disregard older comments about this issue if you're ordering this for the first time.Another main issue is about the leaking but if you screw the top on securely and shake any excess out into a sink before placing it back into the fridge that will prevent leakage. For just in case, it's good to have a paper towel under your brewer when placed on its side.",Easy and Cheap Way To Make Cold-Brew Coffee,Size: 2 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,"1,089 people found this helpful","3,809",376,Public,4758.0

I make my coffee on the weekend so that I don't have to deal with it on weekdays when I'm busy getting ready for work. I thought 2 quarts would give me 4 servings (I drink at least 2 cups of black coffee in the morning) but it only gives me about 3 servings total.Secondly, there is no fill line indicated anywhere on the pitcher so you'd have to eyeball how much water you are putting in (unless you pre-measure your water, which is an extra annoying step I don't want or need). The instructions say you pour water up to 3/4 of the bottle (before coffee) but that depends on how much coffee you have in the filter because once the coffee grounds absorb water, of course they add volume to the total. So you end up with more or less water than you want and have to adjust it accordingly, which means you have to screw and unscrew the filter and pull it out or tilt the filter so you can pour your water.  More annoying additional step.  You can draw a line with a sharpie on the bottle but that's besides the point.  The brewing system needs to be where you put the coffee first and then pour the water over the coffee, without having to mess with the lid, etc., not the other way around.Thirdly, the spout malfunctions every time. It is poorly designed. When you pour your coffee, it ALWAYS drips outside the spout, making a mess, not to mention, wasting my expensive coffee.Fourthly, they claim this is a top rack dishwasher safe. Think about it. In what dishwasher top, could this long pitcher possibly fit vertically? If you lay it flat horizontally, does that clean the inside of the bottle? Of course not. What a stupid claim is this?Lastly, the overall pitcher feels flimsy and has a slight sticky feel (I don't know how to describe this). It certainly does NOT feel like it is a BPA-free material (in comparison with other quality bottles made by Nalgene).Not. At. All impressed whatsoever.

We had been putting off getting one for so long. We have a keurig and simply put brewed coffee in the fridge overnight. But as our keurig seems to be dying, it was time to explore other options. I wish we had done it sooner! This system is so easy to use - add your coffee of choice and water, place it in the fridge and wait for the next day. That's it!!  So easy, great tasting coffee that goes far enough for both of us. It easily fits on a shelf or the door. We're considering buying a second because of how much coffee my husband drinks or if we have company.UPDATE:After a couple weeks of use I've noticed 2 flaws to call out. When inserting the filter into the water the grounds sometimes pop up to the top of the filter. This causes the grounds to get stuck and not submerge fully into the water to brew properly. I'm not terribly picky and haven't noticed a huge difference in taste or quality. The fix is easy - insert the filter into the water slowly and if needed tap the filter firmly on the side of the carafe. With a firm tap the grounds should fall to the bottom of the filter.Also, when you insert the grounds into the carafe and twist shut it will push water out if you’ve overfilled it which some reviewers have identified as “leaking”. Simple solution is to screw on the top and tip it over the sink to pour out any excess water. Once that’s done I haven’t had any problems with leaking.Given that these issues are easily fixed, have become 2-3 extra seconds of my routine, and there is no noticeable difference in taste/quality, I'm leaving my rating as 5 stars.",Should've bought it sooner!,Size: 1 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,734 people found this helpful,"1,128",123,Public,60212.0

I know a lot of people use Mason jars, however, I wanted something easier to grab from the fridge and more lightweight (and cheaper!). I have used Takeya products before and have been impressed with their durability as well as the easiness of cleaning them. This cold brew jug has only 4 pieces; the jug, the handle, the lid, and the coffee filter. The coffee filter has an extremely fine mesh and it has not let through even the finest of coffee grounds. It is really easy to clean! The filter, after filling it with your favorite coffee (I find non-flavored coffee to taste best during the cold brew process) then screws into the lid. After you have filled up the jug about 85% of the way with filter water, you place the filter (already attached to the lid) into the water filled jug and screw it on! The coffee will have a great flavor within 8 hours, however, it is most potent by 24hrs and stays fresh up to 72hrs in my opinion. Remember, you are brewing a coffee concentrate as about 1 cup of grounds are used to brew. Mix with 2 parts water or you will... well, be like me that didn't read the directions and was up until 3am with a caffeine high, lol.

I personally fill the filter and place it in the empty carafe, then pour water through the filter and grounds until the carafe is full.

Basically water never really seeps through completely, resulting in basically the top 14TBsps coffee being wasted. I can imagine the 1 QT design works fine. But this is so flawed.

At first I used the instructions with the amount to tablespoons for each, but found the taste and strength lacking compared to cold brews I would have from ones from coffee shops. After reading on the internet, I got a better understanding on ratios of coffee to water. Here are some things I learned.1) If you grind your own beans, you want it a bit coarse, this will help with extraction and prevent coffee grounds ending up in your brew.2) If you have a measuring scale, this will help to replicate success every time. (they are like $10 on Amazon, I already had one for other food stuff already)3) The makers are 1 quart and 2 quarts, which coverts to approximately - 1 quart = 32 oz = 946 mL - 2 quart = 64 oz = 1892 mL4) Most Cold Brew Ratios say 1 part coffee to 8 parts water (1:8) all the way to 1:4 for stronger concentrates.This is where I have an issue with the Takeya brewer. The included filters are not wide enough to back enough coffee grounds. The filter are the same for both the 1 Quart and 2 Quart sizes, with the 2 quart size having the extension piece. Filling the filter up to the brim, you can fill to just over 100 grams, I got to about 104 grams.- At 104 grams, a 1:8 ratio needs 832 mL of water. At a strong 1:4 ratio, it's 416 mL. Which means a brew would get you approximately 28 oz or 14 oz for a strong brew. For a 1:8 ratio concentrate, that's about 3/4 of the bottle and less than 1/2 for a strong concentrate.- It's even worse for the 2 quart size, even if you fill up the coffee bean into the filter and the extension, you can get about 140 grams or so... but who knows if the beans in the extension are being extracted. At 140 grams a 1/8 ratio is 1,120 mL of water, and 1:4 ratio is 560 mL. At 1:8 ratio concentrate, you get about half the capacity of the bottle, but to let it brew overnight, you have to leave if on its side in order for water to be in contact with the coffee, which it barely covers and is impossible with the 1:4 ratio.With the proper ratio, you get a great tasting and strong cold brew to your preference. The issue is the size of the filter and amount of coffee you can fit in it. The 1 quart version is usable, especially at a 1:8 ratio, but the 2 quart version is not really usable because you can't utilize enough coffee for it. I'm currently using the 1 quart version to brew for now and and the 2 quart to contain my brew to repeat another brew in the 1 quart. I'll continue to use this for now until I find a better option.",All about the ratios.,Size: 1 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,43 people found this helpful,118,51,Public,2290986.0

It wasn't to say that it was bad. It just wasn't the strong concentrate I wanted. For each of the batches, I followed the instructions from the takeya video, as well as the measurement instructions from the cold brew coffee companies I purchased from. And then with a little trial and error, I've been making steady improvements.First problem, cleaning. It warped slightly in the dishwasher, Not enough to be unusable, but enough that it leaks a little when I pour when I'm not careful. The pitcher was too tall to fit on the top rack, and I think having to put it on the bottom was what did it. Since then, I just put in a spot of liquid soap and water, screw the lid on, and shake it clean. Air dry upside down.Second problem, I followed the Bizzy coffee's recommendation of 3:1 water to grounds for a super concentrate. This will work in a French press, but not the Takeya. Three cups of water won't reach the top of the filter, and no more than a cup of grounds will fit in the filter. And if the water can't reach the top of the filter, it can't steep all the coffee, giving you weaker, rather than stronger coffee. Keep to the 4:1 ratio Takeya recommends (4 cups will take it right near the top with the filter in).Third problem, dry grounds. Even following the Takeya recommendation of swishing the filter about, I still had batches where I detached the lid, and the top grounds were dry.  As a result, my concentrate wasn't very...concentrated.And now, my process. I keep to the 4:1 ratio. However, I only put 3 cups into the pitcher. After putting in my cup of grounds, I slowly and carefully pour the last cup of water over the grounds, letting it trickle through the filter. This is my way of making sure all the grounds are saturated for maximum flavor. When I lower the filter into the pitcher, I'll even top it off with just a little more water to make sure it reaches the absolute top of the filter. I brew it in the refrigerator for 36 hours, doing the little filter swish 2-3 times. Even when the coffee company recommends room temperature brewing, I prefer it this way. Room temperature may be shorter, but colder makes it sweeter and smoother in my opinion.*edit* I should add that I couldn't tell you exactly how concentrated it is. I pour the concentrate over ice then add cold water until it's the shade of deep translucent brown that I personally like, and top off with unsweetened almond milk, which I believe is close to a 3:1 concentrate.","Some tries and experiments, I have my method.",Size: 1 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,13 people found this helpful,510,631,Public,6843.0

This unit will do it, if you do it right.I bought my 1qt on December 17, 2018, no issues so far. I thought the filter screen might be the first thing to go, but it and the carafe have held up to countless hand washings/rinsings just fine, never in the dishwasher.Here's what you need to know. The coffee shop cold brew you love is probably brewed in a Toddy. The thing about a Toddy, as well as most cold brewers, is you are brewing a concentrate, to be diluted with water at serving. If you go to Toddy's website and read their instruction book, they give you their recommended brew recipe, but more importantly they give you the recommended ratio to dilute the concentrate with water, for serving.If you extrapolate the Toddy ""as served"" data, here's the recipe you want with this 1qt brewer.1. Weight out 100 grams of dark roast, coarse grind coffee. If you don't have a kitchen scale, buy one.2. Stand the filter in the carafe. Spoon in 1/2 your coffee into the filter (I use a small funnel), then drizzle the coffee grounds with 1 regular size (16.9 fl.oz./500ml bottled water. Spread the water around, as we're trying to eliminate dry grounds.3. Spoon in the remaining 1/2 of your coffee grounds into the filter, then drizzle the coffee grounds with another  regular size (16.9 fl.oz./500ml bottled water. Do this step slowly to let the wet grounds settle without overflowing the top of the filter. In both Step 2 & 3 we are trying to insure there are no dry grounds.4. VERY IMPORTANT: Once the 100g coffee and 1000ml bottled water are in, slightly lift the filter out of the carafe and screw it into the top lid. The filter has a threaded top, and the lid is threaded inside to accommodate it. Screw it in tightly, as this keeps grounds from overflowing into the carafe reservoir.5. Screw this assembly tightly into the carafe, then back off 1/2 to 1 full turn to allow the brew to de-gas for 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes, screw lid on tight and let brewer sit on counter top 18-24hrs. Do not refrigerate yet.6. When brewing is complete, remove lid and unscrew filter for cleaning. With the filter out, the carafe will be 2/3 full of concentrate.7. Add one more 16.9 Fl. oz/500ml bottle water, stirring it in to the concentrate. It will almost overflow, but it will not spill. Serve over ice, or refrigerate carafe for later.8. Dump grounds and rinse filter, let dry on paper towel on counter top.The above ratio of 100g coffee to 1500ml total bottled water gives you almost the exact ""as served"" ratio as Toddy recommends. The above ratio is actually slightly stronger than the Toddy brew, but were talking a negligible 2 decimal points difference. Short story: 100g coffee to 3 500ml bottled waters.

While the last part is definitely not true, the former two are.Let's be honest here... we're lazy sometimes. We've been using a Keurig for years because ... well ... it's convenient. It's also wasteful as heck. Yes there are a few places that offer recyclable K-Cups, most are not recyclable at all. This means they're all being tossed into landfills cup after cup of coffee.We've had a bag of ground coffee in our fridge since Christmas. We just don't brew coffee normally because, like I said, we're lazy. Plus it's summertime, so who wants HOT coffee? Certainly not us! We decided to get in on this ""cold brew"" craze. It's been love at first steep.The way you use this contraption is to fill the clear portion of the container MOST of the way (I leave ~1/2 an inch from the top) with FILTERED WATER. We use the water from our fridge b/c it's the best we have. The instructions state the amount of coffee you should use in terms of TABLESPOONS, however by the time you convert it out, it ends up being a CUP of coffee grounds. I'm bad at counting, especially when it's something boring like 16 tablespoons, so we decided to make a paper funnel and pour the cup in all at once. Screw all the pieces together, and give it a good shake. The instructions don't say this specifically, however about halfway through I give it another quick few shakes, which changes the clarity considerably. After 12-24 hours, pour the brew into a container, and dilute with another liter of water. This is important because what comes out of the coffee maker is a CONCENTRATE. Because of this, you wouldn't want to drink it straight.The flavor of the coffee is pronounced, but not overwhelming. It's not bitter at all. My parents go the same coffee as I did and their reaction was, ""It was just OK."" The cold brew made it amazing. We keep our cold brew in a plastic jug after brewing (the ones most ppl use for KoolAid) and shake it up. Typically this sort of thing stays good for about a week, so we should be good for a while.The only problem I have with this is the filter portion is kind of narrow, so it's difficult to get a *good* clean for it. Granted you can rinse it out really really well, but giving a scrub without specialized equipment isn't possible. I would have also preferred glass instead of plastic, because I feel like less flavor will seep into the plastic for a later time/date. The rubber on the handle is ... awkward. It almost looks like it can/should come off, but at the same time you can tell if you do remove it, you'll likely never get it back on.","GREAT tasting coffee, wish filter area was a *touch* wider",Size: 1 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,16 people found this helpful,"2,816",576,Public,1850.0

Buy this for cold brewing coffee if you love lazy convenience.2. There should be a glass option, but I understand the cost could vary.3. Coffee stays fresh and, as per cold brewing, dramatically less acidic equaling healthier coffee.How do you use this?You simply fill the coffee grounds holder with your favorite coffee (I like Bulletproof because it's clean & imo trusted, but any ground coffee will work), fill the jug with water, screw on the lid to the coffee grounds holder, and then screw on the two jug and lid so that it's airtight. At this point, it's advised to put your coffee in the fridge for 8+ hours. From my experience and preference, 8 hours is perfect, but feel free to experiment - you can tell from the color of the water where the state of the coffee is from a little bit of hour by hour observation :).For non-chilled coffee, you don't have to leave it in the fridge over night - theoretically this could speed up the dissolution of the coffee extract into the water.Overall, no point in not picking this up due to it's price and quality if you cold brew or know someone who cold brews (as a gift.)I got the 1 Quart, which gives me about 6 cups of coffee when filled fully. Pro tip: don't fill the water all the way to the brim, but rather leave about one inch to account for the volume taken by the lid. I'll probably end up getting the 2 Quart just because it would be nice to have when people are over.I highly recommend you transition to cold brewing your coffee over acidifying your gut, just for your own health <3",Coffee drinkers need this,Size: 1 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,85,30,Public,1192675.0

I kinda wish it was glass, but BPA-free plastic is OK too I guess. :)  The coffee maker works exactly as advertised and makes the best tasting cold-brew coffee! Of course it helps if you buy organic whole bean coffee and grind your own fresh, but that's a another topic. I read a few reviews from others saying the grounds tend to float to the top of the filter basket and stick to the lid. Well, I found if I followed the direction, I did not have that problem at all. The instructions that came with mine said to screw the lid/filter basket on the top, shake the entire thing, and store in the fridge ON ITS SIDE.  Then every so often, take it out, loosen the lid and twist back and forth a bit. Then tighten the lid again, and put back in fridge on its side.  I did exactly that, the pitcher never leaked a single drop, there wasn't a single coffee ground in my brew, and it tastes absolutely amazing.I would have given a perfect 5-stars, but there are a couple very minor complaints.  I already mentioned wishing it was glass. Aside from that, the way the spout is designed causes it to drip on the counter no matter how I try to pour it. No biggie.  And the way the plastic threads are designed on the filter basket and lid are a little cheesy and hard to get them to screw together. They tend to cross thread and go crooked very easily. It takes a few tries to get it right. I got the 2-quart model, so my filter basket has the extra little extension piece, which doubles the trouble when trying to screw all of it together. However, once you get the threads lined up right, it seems to screw together tight enough to not let any grounds into your brew -- and THAT is the important part.Anyway, I highly recommend this cold brew coffee maker to anyone looking for one.

The carafe is unbreakable -- the last two I had were glass, one broke and the other developed a crack.  All the parts are easily cleanable.What I don't like:  The mesh on the infuser has come loose at two spots near the top.  The delamination is not complete (yet) and does not allow grounds into the brew, but I think it's only a matter of time before it lets loose completely in those two spots.  Also, I like to suspend the infuser over the carafe to allow all the coffee to come out, not an easy task with this infuser.  So I have to sort of 'lean' the infuser over the open mouth and balance it against another upright object.

Kona, Sumatra, etc.All in all, however, it's a pretty darned good cold brewer, I just wish I could buy another infuser for it.  I may try a home repair with a non-toxic glue, but haven't figured out what to use.EDIT UPDATE:  As I mentioned above, one of the ""cons"" about this brewer is that the mesh lining for the infuser is coming loose at the top.  It has not quite pulled apart YET, but may eventually give way.  I tried to contact the seller Takeya, but it is almost impossible to do so, at least via the Amazon site.

I assumed that getting coffee grinds in your cold brew coffee was normal. I had coarse grinds too; large particles, yet whether I filled the water in the container before or after putting the coffee in, I got coffee grinds in my water either way. Every time you twist the top to pour your coffee, it gets more and more grinds in your water. Plus, the filter membrane can't keep all the coffee contained. Sometimes I'll have as much as a quarter of an inch of coffee grinds settled at the bottom of my Takeya cold brew container, so I have to be careful to pour it very slowly so as to not disturb the settled grinds. It was when a friend came over to my house was disgusted with my coffee drinks with all the grinds in it that I started researching if there was a better way to cold brew. I'm much happier with the ""The Original Cold Brew on Tap by Willow & Everett"" gallon-sized cold brew container that I recently got; it has a very fine metal mesh that i couldn't get the coffee grinds to go through no matter how much water I poured onto the coffee grinds. I'd check into that one too if I were you. I really don't say bad things about products unless I really think something is wrong, and given how many of these Takeya cold brewers I bought, you'd figure I've eliminated the possibility of a defective(dud) product; they all operated the same way.","works, but only if you're ok with coffee grinds in your coffee",Size: 2 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,246,113,Public,627470.0

If you want something fancier, with buttons and functions and fill lines...this is not the product for you. And that's totally cool!. If you like glass and precise measurements, there are a ton of cold brewers that will fit the bill. However, if you're more like me, and are OK eyeballing the amount of coffee you put in and don't mind spending an extra 20 seconds slowly pouring a little water through the grounds to get them completely wet before screwing the filter to the lid and then filling the pitcher the rest of the way up with water and screwing the lid onto the pitcher (by the way - it took me longer to type that sentence than it takes to perform those tasks) you're in the right place. I add course ground coffee until the filter is about 3/4 full, and leave on the counter to steep for 48-ish hours, during which time I give it a good shake whenever the mood strikes. The grounds need space to absorb, expand and move a bit during the shaking process - so if you're packing the filter to the brim, you should not expect a tasty result. Since I steep for 2 days, the resulting brew is concentrated enough that I can top the pitcher off with additional water resulting in a full quart of cold brew that is to my liking. It took me a few tries to get my approach down pat, but I like figuring stuff out so that's part of the fun for me. As mentioned by other reviewers, and if I look reallllly hard, I can see little lines in the clear part of the pitcher that look like hairline cracks, but I haven't experienced any leakage. Bottom line is, this pitcher is easy to clean by hand and small enough to fit in the door of my fridge. I've had this for nearly 2 years, make 1-2 batches per week and we're still going strong.

I think for this pitcher being plastic and the design flaws it's a little over priced. I would have loved one of these in college but not sure if I would have spent the money on it. The lid could be improved. It would be nice if there was a way to open the top part of the lid without having to take out the filter so you can pour water over the grinds. Not a HUGE deal just would be a good way to improve the product design.At first I though 2 quarts is too small but if you only have one glass a day 2 quarts is a good size. However if you don't want to dilute your cold brew the 4 quart might be better for you since if you do the 3/4 cup of coarsely ground coffee to 4 cups water ratio(which fills up the pitcher 3/4 of the way as they instruct) you will be left with 1/4 space left in the pitcher when you take the filter out after it's done ""steeping"".  I top it off with water but if you add water your cold brew will not last as long in the fridge and needs to be finished in 2-3 days or else the flavor starts to change(for the worse).This tucks away nicely in my fridge though!My ideal coldbrew pitcher would be a way to flash brew it the japanese way. A compartment for coffee grounds, ice and a glass pitcher to hold the delicious results! Wishful thinking. This is working good in the meantime though. compact, affordable(but maybe not so much so for the more casual coffee drinker).

I have tried several products to make my own cold brew rather than getting store-bought cold brew and they have all failed and have been returned.  Until now.  I have had the large Takeya cold brew maker for less than two weeks, but I can tell you, this one is a keeper.  I have already made about 10 batches and I'm now having fun trying different coffees.  Right now, I am trying 2 blends and comparing.My process is simple, I fill up the pot with filtered water to about an inch from the bottom of the white rim. I load up the filter with coffee ground coarse to the top of the filter.  I attach the extension and then the lid, and slowly dunk the filter in the water.  I tighten everything and swirl the water around for a minute or two to wet the coffee.  Don't shake too hard or tip it around, well, unless you like grounds in your coffee.I leave the Takeya on the counter for the day, swirling it one in a while.  At night, I place it in the refrigerator and the next morning I transfer to cold brew to another jar, clean up the Takeya and either make another batch right away or just put it away until the next time.  Usually, I start another batch because it doesn't last long.The clean up is pretty quick.  I dump most of the grounds directly in the garbage.  I know some people use the grounds for other purposes, I don't, but I also don't put them in the garbage disposal.  I then clean and dry all the parts with soap and water, rinse, dry and assemble.My observations:1- The extension is sometimes finicky to connect to the filter.2- I'm not sure how sturdy the actual filter fabric is and I treat it very cautiously.  Thankfully, it's not an expensive unit and it's made of plastic so it shouldn't shatter.3- Sometimes find a small amount of residue at the bottom, but since I've only been swirling and not shaking, that seems to have mostly gone away.  I have had batches with no residue whatsoever.  Just gotta be diligent.4- It's actually pretty neat to see the coffee permeate the water over a few hours.

Around here,  it's hard to come by. I started just buying the cold brew bottles and putting them into my reusable cups. I would get frustrated because they would be sold out time to time,  so i would have to buy 4-5 (i drink 2 cups of hot in the morning fresh ground,  1 cup of cold in the afternoon when it's hot,  and finish off the day with a decaffeinated hibiscus blend hot tea). At roughly 5/ bottle,  each bottle lasting 2 days,  that's roughly 2.50 a day. That's quite a lot when you add up how many hot months there are down south (basically April to part of November depending on the year and mothers nature). You can see how this adds up quickly, not to mention the plastic waste, for something that is OK. I have my own espresso maker (which i do make amazing coffee might i add), so why not this. I researched several.  I didn't want to spend a lot on something that i wouldn't really dedicate myself to,  and this fit the price.  Honestly,  I wish I had purchased the bigger one available,  but I was holding myself accountable.  When i first opened it,  it felt cheap to me.  I rolled my eyes, and figured you get what you pay for.  That was not the case here at all. The center holder for coffee was measured perfectly and even stands straight to easily fill.  Super easy to take apart and clean. Simple sleek design.  No slip handle grip.  Simple twist top. Great pour spout. I am impressed by this.  It takes roughly 1/4 of a standard sized bag of coffee, so roughly 2.50 to fill plus water,  shake,  refrigerate, and wait.  I pour into a double walled Insulated Stainless steel cup with a straw roughly 1/2 full and the rest with water.  I get to use my preferred beans (if using whole bean, grind as if you are making for a standard drip coffee pot). Make sure you shake it before pouring to fully mix.  This makes roughly 4 cups. Now that 2.50 a day has been changed to a more palatable 0.675 a day.  I recommend using a blonde coffee bean,  as a dark bean can be a shock for some to drink black.

I have yet to still find a very good brewing time for my coffee and different coffees have different characteristics and reaction to brewing management. Like with aeropress, I am still experimenting, though I have quit that method for quite a while now. I would like to get back with the aeropress some of these days. You can view cold brew as a sort of meal prep; you'll have coffee for days before brewing another one, unless you're in love, or need a lot of coffee. Whereas the aeropress, even though it's quick, it still can be served in a relaxing manner if that is your sort of thing, I'm for sure not like that every day as some days you want to rush the start of the day like there's no tomorrow lol.Now with my cold brew, a day and a half gives me a good brew, usually, with the coffee container almost full and the water about an inch to the brim(the visible, not the threaded area). I like it when I store it at room temperature as it gives me the general cold brew taste. I can't remember trying it in the fridge, but I heard you just have to give an extra day or hours. And I've mentioned, you can have mugs of the brew for days and I am not joking, this thing does store a good amount, granted, you do dilute the concentrate with water. For that, I commend this item for its effectiveness.

I have full control of the strength and flavor, I can even get creative and combine different coffee grounds to make my own brew. My only complaint is the filter piece is difficult to clean. I have tiny hands and cannot reach down in there with normal hand-washing methods. The other plastic pieces are pretty easy to clean, I can even fit my entire arm into the pitcher section to clean it with a soft sponge.

Even  better, the absolutely airtight and watretight seal of the lid, when closed, means that the cold coffee may be brewed while the device is lying on its side, which is something that the manufacturer recommends.One more incrediblly helpful design feature: the center immersible filter screen cylinder has been designed to hold all coffee grounds BENEATH the surface of the liquid during brewing/steeping, thus insuring complete immersion of the grounds (many other brands of cold brew coffee maker do not do this, thus creating a recipe for disaster!).Amazing product!

This leads to all of the coffee floating to the top of the device. I instead manually hold the filter in place, then pour in the water, finally screwing onto the two piece lid. The design of my (sadly broken) glass carafe was superior. But I won't buy glass again.Also the O-ring system is inconvenient. After the initial wash, I could hardly get the O-ring back on (success after a few ""humorous"" shots across the kitchen). I'm afraid to even try taking it off to wash again so I am leery about cleanliness.And it definitely LEAKS if leaning sideways, fortunately found this out over the sink!Hubby (primary user) has trouble seeing when the cover is open for pouring, but he is mechanically challenged, so most people probably would not have that problem.Most annoying: my previous (broken) carafe had a filter that actually screwed off at the bottom.

At 24 hours I was rewarded with a deep black pitcher full of cold brew. The flavor is fantastic, the coffee is smooth and strong (this will of course, depend on your coffee of choosing and grind size).A few notes:- It is easy to take apart and clean- It does indeed fit in the door of my fridge- The 2qt model suggests 28-32 tablespoons. At 28 tablespoons, the level of the grounds when dry is higher than the filter itself, nearly up into the extender which is why I stopped there. I do not know if I would ever use more than 28 for fear of wasting coffee.- Pour spout does not drip while in use. It opens about 1 full turn to pour coffee, you can continue to open it but past that point you are actually unscrewing the entire lid/filter.- You do need to remove the filter/grounds when the brewing process is done so it does not become bitter.

Most folks recommend a ratio of about 15-20g of coffee for every 100ml of water.  The filter only holds at most 120g of coffee, which means 800ml of water, producing a low concentrate of 15:100.  Fine, I could like with that.

However, once I start using the spout to pour tea and return it to the fridge, some liquid always gets on the fridge shelf, but that is probably something I am doing rather than the product.Super happy with the purchase as I was mostly looking for a large pitcher that could handle boiling water directly poured into it, fits nicely in the fridge door, and is easy to clean. Bonus points for multiple uses as a flavored water maker or coffee brewer.After a few months of use, I would definitely recommend to friend, and I already have.",Happy with purchase,Size: 1 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,9,23,Public,2453725.0

Made my first batch yesterday morning and poured myself some today... came out exactly how I would of hoped even with cheaper supermarket coffee (wasn't gonna waste my good stuff experimenting)! Couple key points... since the filter is attached to the top, its not the easiest to pour over your grounds in order to properly stir and ""bloom"" them. If done correctly this refines the flavor and smoothness of your brew. I get that's a hot coffee deal but it does make a difference for cold brew as well. I added 1 cup of course ground coffee, then ran cold water over them into the container and let it sit for 15 minutes... instead of stirring I bobbed the filter in the water and agitated the grounds before adding the next cup. Repeated the process now with a full container and all grounds associated with the recipe. Brew sat refrigerated for 24 hours before serving.

My wife never drank coffee because she hated the taste of it.  Well after a couple trips with her co-workers to the local coffee shop my wife became addicted to Ice coffee.  Now, If you have children you will understand what it is like to truly be perpetually tired.  This ice coffee addiction quickly became a $75 a week bill, so much that we were literally added it to our bill spread sheet.  We realized this was a problem so we decided to try a cold brew coffee concentrate from the local Aldi's.  My wife was in love.  The thing with Ice coffee is that it is brewed strong and then cooled with ice.  My wife, not liking the flavor of the coffee, would add an absurd amount of cream and sugar.  Cold brew coffee has a different flavor.  Sorry I am by no means a connoisseur of coffee but I didn't know that until I started doing some research.  Cold brew lacks the bitterness you get from hot brewing the beans.  We fill the 2 quart coffee filter with coffee to the top of the screen part of the filter, add just over 1 1/2 quarts of cold water to the maker, seal it up and lay it on it's side (per instructions) and let it sit for 12 hours.  My wife then mixes it 2 parts coffee to 1 part water and stores it in a glass container.  In the morning she simply pours from the container to her mug and adds a dash of french vanilla creamer.  No sugar.  I have long been a hot coffee drinker, I now drink these cold brews the same way.  10/10 would recommend this product to anyone else.  I am a little concerned with how long the filter will hold up, and the handle does seem a little flimsy if you try to pick the full pitcher up by it.

My biggest issue, though, is that there's no good way to squeeze excess water/coffee out of the grounds once you're finished. I've tried leaving the filter in a big cup or mug for a while to let the water drain out to then add back to the jug, but I eventually settled on transferring the grounds to some cheese cloth and wringing it out by hand.Another issue I had is with the instructions. You're instructed to fill the filter/infuser pretty much completely full with grounds, which for the 1 quart jug would make it about a 1:4 ratio of coffee:water, which is a concentrate. But the instructions don't tell you to water it down before drinking. If you like your coffee strong, this is fine enough, but for most people you'll probably want to dilute that concentrate by about 1/2 before drinking. Or as an easier option, just only fill the infuser about halfway, and the coffee straight from the jug should be just right.","Easy and convenient, with some caveats",Size: 1 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,,29,31,Public,3562826.0

I can only guess that reviewers who have issues didn’t read the included instruction booklet. Which I admit- I didn’t at first either but was able to remedy the issues I had. Overall if you love cold brew and are looking for a good zero-waste device that you can use over & over this is it!Important things to remember- 2 Cups of COARSE ground coffee. Yes the mesh is fine and I don’t think fine grounds would leak through it, but they will escape when you shake / swirl the pitcher. In the US, prior to COVID you could ground coffee beans in most grocery stores specifically to Coarse or “for French Press.” The only brand I could find in my Kroger store that was coarse ground is Gevalia their Guatemala variety.* to easily add this 2 cups to the infuser the Ball mason jar funnel fits perfectly. Otherwise you’ll have to go spoonful by spoonful- Fill with 7 cups of water BEFORE you put the infuser back in. Some reviewers complain they have to measure the water. But you could do it once and then put a mark on the pitcher to see where you filled it to. It’s an extra step but I don’t think it’s worth taking a star away-Once pitcher is filled with water, twist the infuser into the cap FIRST. Then lower the infuser by the cap into the pitcher. If you don’t twist the infuser into the cap first the grounds will float out. Twist cap close- Swirl the pitcher and let it sit for 12-36 hours. This makes a cold brew concentrate the longer you let it sit with the grounds in it. So be sure to add water to taste to the concentrate when you go to drink. Unless you like super strong brew.* the pitcher was too tall to fit in my main fridge standing, but fits PERFECT on my door.

For stronger coffee, you can ""steep"" as long as 24 hours before the coffee grounds become repugnant from what I gather.

I absentmindedly left mine in the fridge for approximately 18 hours, had agitated it as suggested but only three or four times, and it came out great. My only peeve is that it has to brew on its side which takes up room and I really had to crank down on the lid to get it to not leak.

First, the filter is not quite fine enough to keep the coffee grounds out of the liquid. This is an issue with many cold brew coffee makers, but with this one it is substantial enough that I have to shake the container prior to filling each cup of coffee, or else the last cup at the bottom will be undrinkable from the amount of grounds left over. Secondly, there has been a leak that has developed in the seal for the container. Its nothing major, but when I shake the container to agitate the grounds or before pouring a cup (see my previous issue) liquid will come out of the container even when sealed tightly and even after adjusting the seals multiple times.Again, for the price this product is a great start to get people into cold brewing and it has definitely gotten me into the process.

Heed my warning, it is a lot of work. But it makes the best cup of iced coffee I've ever had - & depending on where you live, that might be highly necessary. See the below:-Start making it the night before the day before you want the coffee. If you want it Monday, start Saturday night. 36 hours is the key - I've tried 24 and I've tried 48, they were either too weak or too bitter (respectively). Usually, when I have one day's serving left I put it in a mason jar so I never have to go a day without.-Scoop 22 tablespoons of full beans (I do not know the measurement once its ground). Sounds like a lot, but if you buy a 2-tablespoon scooper it's not bad. I buy the Costco whole beans with the cat on them - lasts about a month for ~$15.-BUY A GOOD COFFEE GRINDER. I used to do this with a small, hand-controlled one (estimating what was considered ""coarse"") and it was terrible. I think after the second time I gave up & bought a conical burr coffee grinder (I set it to a coarseness level of 13/15). Best money I've spent for this, makes all the difference. The actual pitcher is pretty cheap, so it's easy to justify the extra cost.-Fill up the pitcher higher than 3/4. Figure out with a sharpie where the max you can fill it up without it overflowing is. Otherwise, you're just wasting beans. If it's accessible to you, filtered water will always be better than tap.-Put the grounds in the mesh, screw it all together, and put it in the fridge SIDEWAYS. Then, shake it every few hours (no set formula there - just whenever you remember. Maybe every 4-6 hours, except for the overnight).-Once your 36 hours is up, unscrew the top and hold the mesh filter slightly above the pitcher. Press GENTLY to release about 6oz or so more of cold brew that gets stuck in there (we do not waste in this house).-DO NOT PUT THE WHOLE THING OF GROUNDS IN YOUR GARBAGE DISPOSAL. You are welcome. After that, it's pretty easy to clean!BAM. It was a mission but you're done. This usually lasts me 3 days (& after the second day, put remainder in a mason jar & set it all back up). It's a lot of work, but I find it worth it. It's all about what you consider best for you!

I have never looked back.  It's a great product, and I even purchased a second so I could make two different coffees every few days.  I noticed that Jessica M. pointed out that when putting the grounds in the filter, the water causes them to float.  An additional fix for this is to invert the device (it is airtight and watertight) and swirl.  This usually gets all the grounds wet.  Here in New Zealand, the coffee is packaged in 200 gram bags.  The Takeya Cold Brew Iced Coffee Maker will hold 100 grams, so each bag is two full brews.  Always remember that the brewed coffee needs to be diluted with water, ice, and/or milk.  Drinking it straight makes my heart beat too fast, LOL!  There is another filter you can buy from Takeya to make iced tea, which uses different filter material (a wire mesh instead of silk cloth).  Be very careful cleaning it, as the silk filter material can easily be punctured (which renders the entire thing useless, as coffee grounds will seep into the brew).  The container is dishwasher safe on the top rack, which is perfect for cleaning (thought I recommend not putting the filter through the dishwasher, or rinsing it afterwards to remove any excess detergent).  I also just rinse between brews during the week and just run it through the dishwasher on the weekends.  That's it.

If I hadn't already used the carafe, I would have returned it and buy a different one--I didn't realize how much these two things would make me prefer a different product, but then again, I guess I wouldn't have known how irritating it is without having used this one!

I had one previously that was another brand. It was glass and broke. The biggest reason I like this one is that it’s not glass, but does feel a bit more flimsy. It is very simple and easy to use, just put in ground coffee, water, let sit. I make a pitcher and it lasts me for two days so usually after the first day I’ll pour it into my coffee cup for the next day and make another pitcher to be ready in time. One thing that is a bit annoying is the piece intended to hold the coffee grounds, While it attaches to the lid, the coffee grounds float. Previous brands had you slowly pour the water over the grounds to saturate completely. This one you put the water in , put the grounds in the filter then screw the filter to the lid and push in. This causes some of the coffee grounds to stay afloat above the water.

When we originally started making cold brew at home, it was messy and time consuming to use a series of bowls and strainers to remove the spent coffee grounds.This lightweight pitcher has no bells and whistles so to speak, but it does exactly what you want it to do with little fuss and hands-on time. You fill the filter with coffee, fill the pitcher 3/4 with water, shake well, and refrigerate. After the coffee has infused to your satisfaction, you take the lid off, remove the filter, and you have cold brew concentrate. You really only need minutes of hand-on time from start to finish.The filter is ultra-fine, so even if you are using a very finely ground coffee, it keeps everything out. (If the coffee is a very fine grind, a minimal amount of sediment may sink to the bottom, but it's easy to avoid.) The lid screws on tightly and truly is leak proof. I feel confident that we could take the pitcher of coffee with on a weekend trip.While I wish the pitcher was slightly larger, it is so easy to get a batch going that we don't mind making it a little more often. He's the only coffee drinker, and a pitcher has been lasting him several days. However, in a household with several, habitual coffee drinkers, this pitcher may prove to be too small on its own. But it's still so easy to use, so I'd just recommend getting a second pitcher.All in all, I recommend this product for anyone who loves cold brew and saving their valuable time.","Small, but does exactly what you want it to do with minimal effort",Size: 1 qtColor: BlackVerified Purchase,,8,5,Public,12297710.0

I used New England coffee, and steeped for about 20 hours. The brew's strength comes wholly from its flavor and NOT from any acidity. There is not a hint of acidity, which is an issue I face getting cold brew at some cafes. The blueberry notes from the grounds are expressed in a pleasant and creamy fragrance, and I am surprised by how much caffeine I am getting considering the weakly acidic profile.My complaints so far are centered on how much solid material diffuses into the water while brewing. I definitely surpassed the recommended brewing time of 12-18 hours, and did do regular shakes to strengthen the diffusion, so I will try single shakes and shorter brewing times to see how much this affects the smoothness of the brew at the expense of strength. This is by no means as bad as drip coffee, although the by-product seems to be more noticeable in this coffee than say in a cafe-bought coffee. I would attribute this to the filter quality, and am interested in seeing how the issue develops over time.For now, the pronounced flavor profile, strength, and low acidity merit 5 stars for me, especially at the cost and amount of money that I'll be saving (not to mention the flexibility I now have with picking my own grounds).

My old method of getting my iced coffee fix was to make hot coffee, leave it out for a few hours until it got to room temp, then leave in the fridge overnight. Compared to that, this coffee brewer is so much easier, less time consuming, and doesn't involve you leaving coffee out for hours on end. However, I noticed that I had to be very specific about how much water to use and how long to leave it in the fridge (I fill it up as much as I can without it overflowing when I put the grounds in and try to remember to take it out after no more than like 12 hours, and the recommendation is 12-24 hours), otherwise it makes more of an espresso flavor than coffee and the grounds absorb a little of the metallic taste from the fine mesh filter, and you have to use a LOT of creamer to mask the taste. But once you figure out what water ratio and steeping time you prefer, this is a wonderful little coffee pot for fellow cold brew lovers. Also, be warned, it doesn't really make as much coffee as you'd think it would because of how much volume the filter takes up, so I have to repeat the process about every 5 days (which is sooo worth it compared to how much I spent on Starbucks every morning!!!).

The thirsty camels here have been chugging it down so quickly I've been forced to make just about a batch a day. Including a batch on Friday so it's extra potent and ready to tackle all of our 'case of the Mondays'.What we do here is grind up whole beans (dark or medium roast) on a coarse ground setting, pour them in the filter, and then (gently) place the filter into the container. As you start filling it up direct the water onto the center of the grounds so that way they're getting soaked all the way through. They'll start to bubble up so let them settle and continue filling. As the container fills the filter will float up to the top and there you have it to screw into the lid. Entire time to grind beans and fill up with water should take 3 minutes (5 minutes if you're slow). After that into the fridge it goes and it's ready for the thirsty office camels the next day!
