That's when I noticed how poor the system works with 2 big problems.1. The game in theory, will let people (each with their own Nintendo Online account) to play together without using Microsoft Realms. I thought this would be a godsend, but it seems Nintendo hasn't done a great job aligning the features and my son soon realized that you can create a new world and both of us can play on it, but when we log out he can no longer join that server. Doesn't matter if I make the server/world, or if he does, you seem to only get 1 play out of it. I looked at NAT types, I've tried port forwarding, and slew of other things. Nintendo/Mojang support is not helpful either with this problem apparently plaguing other users.2. The game itself is very buggy considering how it seems Nintendo Online handle latency and other issues.

PC and PE have worked great. No complaints or problems. On the Switch has been an entirely different story.The game freezes and crashes sometimes during gameplay. This is infrequent, but a real pain.Worse, it recently started almost always freezes the entire Switch, requiring a hard reboot, when signing in to play on Minecraft Realms. It also constantly loses its connection to a microsoft profile, so you constantly have to redo this broken horrible process.Then the kicker is Nether portals don't always work. Which is honestly even worse than only working sometimes. My son got trapped in the Nether because a portal worked going into the Nether, and didn't going back to the overworld. I had to break the Nether portal and rebuild it differently, then it worked. But now he can't use the same portal from the overworld that used to work, even after restarting the game.

It is what it is.When it comes to other things, for example the offhand slot in game, it is EXTREMELY limited in comparison to the PC version where you can offhand virtually any item in the game. With this version, you can only effectively use in the offhand maps, and shields. Shields in particular you use by ""sneaking""/crouching.Besides those things, it is by all means Minecraft, and relatively up to date to boot as this is the ""Bedrock Edition"".One of the more impressive features is the ability to play fully locally with up to four players simultaneously EVEN IN TABLETOP mode!There is a local wireless play as well. So if your friends have their Switch's with them, you can play with them even without the Nintendo online service. So if possible, to play effectively with others, try playing locally on one Switch, or attempt to play via local wireless with multiple Switch systems.Yes Command Blocks are in this. So you can make those ""in game mods"" that are implemented solely by Command Blocks. That alone is a very powerful feature to be present.As for any additional tips for this particular version I can give is, try going into the settings, go to the control rebind section(s), and bind ""Jump"" to ""clicking"" the Left stick. Then bind ""Sneak"" to the Right stick click. Those two bindings in combination helps a lot I've found.Do note that as of 1/29/2020, there doesn't seem to be any way to disable ""double tap forward to dash"". So if you want to sprint, tap forward twice and you'll sprint. It would've been nice if it had a checkbox to disable that in case you wanted to bind sprinting to something else and not accidentally sprint from double tapping forward.All in all, if you goal isn't the online multiplayer, or you used the offhand feature and love it to death on PC, you're better off staying on PC/Windows-10-Version. If you can live with those compromises, or your party of friends like to play locally to begin with, its a great time! Its definitely a lot more manageable to make those large buildings by chipping away at your tasks a little bit at a time. Which is really easy to do due to the nature of the Switch.Do note that in order to play with others locally on one Switch system, you'll need to give your friends some sort of controller that has two joy sticks. You could hypothetically use a gamecube adapter in docked mode, and let your friends play with you via Gamecube controller. So no, you cannot play with one Joy Con per player in this game. But considering it uses twin stick controls, that is to be expected.","Some strange changes but overall, its Minecraft",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I spent nearly 500 hours on the Switch Edition before the Bedrock edition finally released for the Switch.I was hesitant to purchase the Bedrock edition as I had played it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5"" and it was quite glitchy and the graphics were different enough to catch my attention.  I am glad that I purchased it because the issues I have on my Galaxy Tab S were, apparently, due to the limitations of the tablet's hardware.

First off, there will be times where I will leave the game and when I come back my profile won’t pop up leaving me to either wait and see what happens(which usually leaves me waiting like 5 minutes) or go through Microsoft and log in again(which can be so annoying). Another issue I have is with online playing otherwise known as Realms. There are so many bugs I don’t even know where to start, so I’ll just give you the cliff notes. There are times where the blocks won’t break or blocks that I didn’t click on will disappear, times where I will randomly lose health for no reason, and when I have to log back on the game(due to a situation I will get to later) some of my items will disappear, along with many many more. My biggest issue with this game card out of everything is that I will be playing on realms and all of the sudden the game will glitch out and tell me that my server is disconnected. I have to log back out of the game and come back in(sometimes having to restart the entire console) which can be literal torture due to the previous issues I have mentioned before. I have absolutely no explanation as to why this game card has so many positive reviews other than the brand selling this paying them off because there is no way they are genuinely enjoying this glitchy mess.
