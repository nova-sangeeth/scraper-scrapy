I keep using H&RBlock because it does what I need and it has always been cheaper than TurboTax. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers the mutual fund's sales, cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D, capital gains and losses), the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116), as well as stock sales. It also includes Schedule C (profit or loss from business) and Schedule K1 (K-1 S Corps) if you are reporting gain or loss on your personal taxes.

You can get notified about the price drops by checking camelcamelcamel site that can send you emails when the price drops by the amount you specify. During the last tax year season, the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, dipping below $30 a number of times. It also qualifies for digital credits for No-rush Prime shipping. However, it no longer qualifies for rewards from Prime Card rewards (this change started last year).* WHAT IS INCLUDED~~~~~~~~~~~~~Using tax software includes two fees - one to use the software and the second one to e-file the returns with IRS. This package includes the cost of using both the Federal tax return and State return for one state (if you need to file taxes in two states, you will need to buy the second state software at full price).This package also includes the cost of 5 free Federal e-files but it does NOT include the cost of e-file for the state return. Note that there is NO limit on how many returns can be printed on paper for either Federal or State returns, so you can print and mail any number of returns you desire.Note 1: New York State law prohibits additional charges for State e-file (NY residents still have to pay for using the software).  There is an income limit to qualify for a totally free e-file.  In 2018 the limit was $66,000. The limit for 2020 will be posted in January 2021 on the NY state website.Note 2: In the comments, I posted a full list of states that allow e-file, as well as the list of states that require the return to be printed and mailed.* The state forms are not available as I write this review. When I tried to install my state return I got a message that I will receive an email when state return will become available.When the state forms become available the state software can be downloaded directly from the H&R Block application from the first screen of the state tax preparation. There is no extra fee.All updates of both federal and state software are free.* GENERAL~~~~~~~~~~~~~* When you start the software, the first step (after validating your license) allows you to old your data from the previous year's return. You can load H&R Block software, TurboTax, or a PDF copy of the 2019 return.* Since many of my numbers are not final, I use the H&R feature that allows me to mark entries as “tentative” (right mouse click, then select “mark entry as tentative” from a drop-down list).H&R Block keeps track of all tentative entries and displays them during a ""check"" step which normally is invoked at the end of the interview, but can also be invoked by itself at any time. The check step lists all entries marked as tentative so it is easy to update them.* H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should have determined if the person would truly benefit from the Premium version first. That would have been useful. As it stands now it is just annoying.What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally, it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.  Schedule C is a complete schedule - expenses, depreciation, and all that through an interview process. The difference with the Premium version is that with Deluxe you are reporting gain or loss on your PERSONAL taxes.* To combat stolen-identity tax returns H&R Block now asks you to provide a state-issued ID number. It is not required but highly encouraged.* H&R Block provided me some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example, foreign tax paid by a mutual fund). However, I needed to keep switching between the whole-form view and interview to enter data and then back to the interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into the whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.* I like DeductionPro which helps suggests reasonable prices based on the condition of the donated used clothing items. It is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.* The final tax return can be saved in a PDF format for future reference. I always do that so I can re-print an old return without having to run an old copy of H&R Block (especially down the road when a new computer may not even have an old H&R Block installed).* H&R Block can print forms when an Ethernet connection is disconnected. In 2014 TurboTax introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. H&R Block does not have this requirement.* If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank (free), mailing a check (free), and paying by credit card from a secure website (not free). IRS does not charge a fee but the sites that provide this service do. There are several web sites that provide this service with a ""convenience"" fee. If you search for ""pay taxes by credit or debit"" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov website.* Is it possible to download an old version of H&R Block software purchased on Amazon?Yes. Amazon allows you to download the software purchased on Amazon as long as you have an Amazon account. There is no extra charge for downloading old software. The first download I bought on Amazon was in 2009 and I tested that I can still download it.Note that if you purchased the software directly from the H&RBlock site, they add on a charge for ""extended download service"". Amazon does not do that.To get an old digital download you go to ""your orders"", then ""digital orders"" and then select a year from the drop-down list. The list goes back to the year I opened my Amazon account.* Does the application provide a feature to confirm IRS/state agency tax acceptance status?Yes, once you submit your return there will be a button on the first page to request a status check. The resulting status will be displayed on the first page. You can request status updates multiple times.TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I ran into an issue trying to save my return as PDF995 (i.e. as PDF). Reinstalling PDF995 software (it comes with H&R Block software) did not help. When I looked under Print Settings it showed PDF995 as the default printer. I had to change the default printer to my real printer and then I was able to successfully save as PDF995. I wanted to share this tip in case someone else runs into this issue.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.Ali Julia review",Cost effective solution,Platform: PC DownloadEdition: Deluxe + StateVerified Purchase,221 people found this helpful

I started to panic and thought that someone had hijacked my return, but it didn't make any sense.  I eventually figured out that it was a scam embedded in the software to try to get me to sign up for their personalized services, which I don't want.Second, I was unable to print my state return.  It said that the forms that I need weren't ready, except that all the forms I was using seemed to be up to date, and they didn't have any scheduled updates to the software (the date was 2 days in the past, at the time).I spent most of a day on hold trying to find someone who could tell me if the software was broken (by most of the day, I mean around 5 hours total, no exaggerations).  I was hung up on twice, and there was no way to contact the software support people directly, making the hold time extremely long, even for late January.  I eventually was told that they were waiting on an update from the state government, and that they didn't know when it would happen.  If the message I saw had said that, I wouldn't have needed to try to get customer support, and I would simply have waited for the situation to resolve itself, which it eventually did.  Instead, I was wondering if the software was broken.  It wasn't broken, it was giving me confusing messages.I've been using this software for decades, generally with no problems.

MUST READ THIS PRIOR RO PURCHASING.  ONCE PURCHASED THERE ARE NO REFUNDS PER AMAZON's WARNINGI tried for over 2 hours on Thursday night  (8:30 to 10:30) to talk to someone about a problem I had with the state module for NJ. I had a total rollover of a 401K account.  The federal return properly characterized it as being non-taxable.  The NJ module was showing it as completely taxable.  There was no way to have the program change this designation - other than go into the form and ""override"" the information.  The problem is when you override the form information, you are told that you cannot eFile your return.  The problem is that NJ requires you to file your state return using eFile.  Now I am put into a bad situation.  The difference in taxes is over $10,000.So much for your guarantee of correctness.  Are they going to reimburse me for the cost of a defective program let alone the $10,000.  To top it off, the information while I was on hold kept advising me how much longer I was going to be on hold -  first 50 minutes, the 15 minutes, then 12 minutes, then 30 minutes, then 15, then 11, then 11,  then 11.  After the 3rd time of being informed 11 minutes, I hung up.By the way, the announcements informed the listener that they can use the on-line help features of the H&R website to ask questions.  They referred to a link on the website.  But the link either does not exist or is hidden where no one can find it.  Believe me I looked while on hold for the 2 hours.

The list goes back to the year I opened my Amazon account.* Does the application provide a feature to confirm IRS/state agency tax acceptance status?Yes, once you submit your return there will be a button on the first page to request a status check. The resulting status will be displayed on the first page. You can request status updates multiple times.TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I ran into an issue trying to save my return as PDF995 (i.e. as PDF). Reinstalling PDF995 software (it comes with H&R Block software) did not help. When I looked under Print Settings it showed PDF995 as the default printer. I had to change the default printer to my real printer and then I was able to successfully save as PDF995. I wanted to share this tip in case someone else runs into this issue.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.Ali Julia review",Cost effective solution,Platform: PC DownloadEdition: Deluxe + StateVerified Purchase,221 people found this helpful

Advertising convinces us that to do it properly, we must pay something to someone. For many of us this means the annual process of deciding which of the bad software choices is preferable.I chose HR Block this year only because I used it last year and figured it would make things easier when it came to importing data from the previous year's return.Well, there is the little game vendors play where in addition to providing a means to complete a federal return they ""include"" one state for ""free"". Well, free, except that you must pay a significant amount of money for HR Block to actually transmit the return. And they warn up front that the forms the state module will generate are NOT the normal ones for the state.Oh well, I knew the state module would not be completely useful. But I figured it would give me a leg up when I use the State government's free online filing to submit the return. Well, that was *ALMOST* true. The problem is that within the state module, the HR Block software put me into an endless loop of warning me that *maybe* I needed the SSN of a dead relative but probably not... repeat, repeat, repeat. There was no graceful way to move past the ""possible"" warning.OK, well, I used it to submit my federal return. I immediately got a message back from HR Block saying that I had successfully submitted my return. Checking back within the software each day afterwards, I got a message saying ""your federal return was successfully transmitted on 01/31/2021 05:30:50 pm. The IRS accepts or rejects most returns in 6-8 hours, but may take up to 48 hours."" Well, later I discovered that at best, this message is misleading, at worst it is just plain false.After 48 hours I had still not received any confirmation that the feds had ""accepted"" the return. So I decided it would be appropriate to get a clarification from HR Block. We have all been trained that trying to reach a ""human"" on the phone is nearly impossible, so I chose to try the link for ""chat"" within the application. Broken functionality. Completely broken. I tried every variation I could think of to be able to click on the button and chat with someone. No matter what I did, clicking HR Block's ""chat"" button would completely freeze up the application. (see attached screen image. It refers to ""the other program"". Since this was the only application running, I can only guess some sort of schizophrenia on the application's part). The only way to clear the screen was to call up the MS-Windows ""task manager"" to ""kill"" the HR Block application.So, I summoned my courage and tried phoning them. IVR-Hell (""interactive voice response""). I was immediately subjected to all kinds of irrelevant questions like whether I am able to download software. Five minutes later, and after numerous attempts to summon ""agent"" or ""representative"" I got a message saying they were closed. Sigh...Well, the next day, after scouring the internet for information, I discovered a news article that said that the IRS has not even begun to accept any transmissions of tax returns, and indeed would not do so until after February 12. So HR Block's happy messages telling me that they had submitted my return appears to have been totally false.Frustration. Perhaps HR Block will *truly* submit the return a week from now. Maybe not.I guess I should keep in mind that unlike some of the competing tax software products, this is from a company whose ""bread and butter"" is luring folks into their tax offices, not providing functional software.Next year I will definitely use a different system!",Broken software and bad communication- Hard to trust this software and H&R Block,Platform: PC DownloadEdition: Deluxe + StateVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

I've used your Deluxe software for half a decade now and its seemed great. But long story short and where my disappointment comes into play, when filing with the status of ""married filing separately"" this year the software calculates an incorrect federal return amount. It calculates a negative return value when the return value should be positive right after entering your W2 information. To test my theory I logged into H & R Blocks free web tax return version, entered all of the same W2 information and filing status and I got the expected positive federal return amount that I should get. So over the course of a week I've been trying to get ahold of a real person to talk to, because there is clearly a software federal return related calculation bug. I finally got a hold of a real person to chat with today, explained and physically typed out the whole issue, uploaded my return in progress through the Tools section in the software, gave all the information possible and then the agent just ended the chat. Leaving you with no resolve and your only option to restart the chat session, wait in queue again for another 4 hours in hopes that the next agent won't just end the session again (this being the second time the chat session was ended by someone other than myself).",Return Calculation Error - When Filing as Married Filing Separately.,Platform: PC DownloadEdition: Deluxe + StateVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

I had only two stock sales (cutting losses) with total capital gain of about $40 but the cost to upgrade in TurboTax was $20 to include form 1099-B (capital gain/loss). So, I searched around and tried the free online version of TurboTax vs. H&R Block vs. Tax Slayer.Note that this review would have been 5/5 for the H&R Block online tax filing but 1/5 for the PC download software.- It was said TurboTax is the most user friendly - not true, H&R Block online has similar prompts and better, the uncommon cases are bundled to save time, we just have to say No if we have none of them, instead of individual Nos in TurboTax.- It was said Tax Slayer is the cheapest - not true, after adding all premiums, H&R Block online is the cheapest. However, I chose to buy the PC download version, thinking it would work exactly the same way and it does not.- It was said TurboTax Deluxe gives the best tax refunds amount - not true and I am still puzzled how they could differ significantly. I have very simple tax situation, head of household with 2 dependents but only college plan contributions and no withdrawals yet, I do have minor account investment but it is all unearned capital gain so no tax is needed, I have one job in one state so 1 basic W-2, a few 1099-INT and 1099-DIV forms from my retirement and brokerage accounts, and 1098-Mortgage for my primary residential only home. I can't believe 4 software/ apps provide 4 different total refunds with the largest gap as $1,900 and the smallest gap as $600.I have tried to use the key provided with this software and redeem in H&R Block online, it did not work either because it was not supposed to, or I have already redeemed it from the installed app. So, I ended up with wasting this product, totally.Another thing I don't really like about H&R Block in general is for the tax refunds, I have only two options (1) H&R Block credit card balance, and (2) direct deposit done via MetaBank with a $39 Refund Transfer fee. So, in total, I have paid $200 for just my tax filing ($124 for the package, $39 for the refund fee, and $35 for the software I am reviewing).I highly recommend trying the online version and do not save a few bucks. Or try to redeem the key online to see if it works. The online interface looks better with higher definition, interactive questions, more tips and explanations, easier navigation for reviews/ edits.

I originally had the software rated as five stars, but since that rating was posted there have been problems. My wife had COBRA insurance during the 2020 tax year and we found out that there is compensation for people that had to have COBRA. There is an IRS form to file, which the software had; however, the form was somewhat confusing and there was little help in the H&R Block software concerning this matter. We filed electronically and there was mention that we'd have to send some documents to the IRS. H&R Block software stated that it would assist us in submitting the documents. There was no assistance. We received notice in the software that our state and federal taxes were accepted. Beyond that we had not heard anything from the IRS or H&R Block, so we thought that everything was OK. A few weeks after receiving our state return, I started to wonder why we did not get our federal return. I checked the H&R Block software and saw nothing, so I went to the IRS site and downloaded the IRS forms that we had used for the COBRA filing. The form said that after the IRS accepts our return that we have to send another IRS form and some documentation concerning the COBRA payments to the IRS by mail. It was supposed to be sent within three days after our return was accepted. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THIS IN THE H&R BLOCK SOFTWARE OR IN THE ONLINE HELP! When I looked up the IRS form on the H&R Block website, the site stated that I should go to an H&R Block store and let a 'professional' do the paperwork (for a fee).

So I purchase the H & R Deluxe version which includes one free state download.On our particular return we filed as Married filing separately.  The taxes are lower if you file in Iowa this status version married.  As a former Iowan I'm familiar with the tax forms.  They have changed little over the years.  There are two columns side by side on the 1040 page 1 and 2.  The right column is for the taxpayer named first on the return and the left column is the spouses income.  On page two toward the end the numbers are combined.  But kept separate throughout much of the return.On page 2 of the 1040 lines 53 & 54 are added together and placed in line 55 of each column.  Except that the software isn't bringing down the total in column A.  It's empty on my return.  In column B the total is there.  The combined line 55 A & B are added together and placed in line 56.  But since column A doesn't have any total now, line 56 is wrong.  If I filed the return with this error I would be subject to underpayment penalties.I called H&R Block support.  I spoke with 3 different people and was on hold nearly 2 hours in between getting transferred from one person to another.  I explained the problem to each and then was passed along to someone else.  Finally I got to the last person and explained the software error.  I used to be a software engineer and know how it works as I've personally corrected many bugs in software over time.  Yet the last state software update for Iowa still has no total in the column A line 55.So I had to override the amount.  This in turn won't allow me to efile the return with the override.  So I had to print it and mail it.H&R Block does not want customers to call or email them about software errors as they make it very difficult.  I'm sure they feel they can fully test their own software and find any errors without outside help.  I'm convinced they think anyone reporting an error must be making some kind of mistake.  It can't be their software in error.So don't assume the return is 100% correct and file it without verifying it against previous year returns.  After all you sign the return that everything is correct and will be stuck if it isn't.

H&R Block software imports 1099 information from most brokerage firms, and when one has a 25-page form, that is invaluably time-saving. I double-checked all the figures imported, and they appeared to be accurate and in the correct spots on IRS forms. The audit support offered by Block (if necessary) is a nice feature. Filing was quick, and I received a confirmation that IRS had accepted the return almost instantly. I also appreciated the one state tax return that was included with the Deluxe software. I printed H&R Block's version of my state return and manually entered it onto my state tax website to avoid filing fees. The math from both forms matched, including tax calculations.There is definitely a learning curve for using the software, interpreting error messages, and manually entering 1099s that won't import. But the Block help system is appalling; I waited 2 hours for a chat representative with a very specific question about an error message. All she could do was read from a script and that info was totally unhelpful. Despite repeated attempts, I never got through via phone, and the ""frequently asked questions"" did not address my questions.If H&R Block would devote some time to improving its help and customer service functions, my rating would be higher. For example, just tell us that although a 1099 may be available to download from our brokerage account, it may take several days until that form is importable into H&R Block tax software. Or remind us that certain capital gains may be lumped (and not listed individually) onto a Schedule D. I have other suggestions for improving the help functions, but they are far too lengthy for this review.","Excellent Software, Abysmal Customer Service",Platform: PC DownloadEdition: Deluxe + StateVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

First, I don't like the way Block continues to hawk their services after you but their software, or halfway through the income items they pause to try and get you upgrade your purchase. For New Jersey, they put ""subtractions"" under the ""income"" menu - not very intuitive. I also found an error in the way it handles medical expenses for states - certainly for NJ. If you don't itemize your deductions, your medical expenses do not carry to the NJ form,  they carry ONLY if itemize - which under the TCJA is far fewer people. This is bad programming and needs to be fixed.  The order of income items  in the menu does not correspond to the list as you click ""next"" on the screen - this can be very confusing. each time an item is finished, it should return to the category to chose another item.  More of these type of ""intuition"" anomalies appear throughout the software.Lastly and very important. Tech support is abysmal.  I saved the chat support conversation (after waiting 90 minutes for an agent) where I discussed a technical issue I was having with efile and they said there are known efile issues and they were not experts and suggested I print and mail the return...WHAT!??  That is unacceptable - period. Why are they there as tech support?  I also asked when the unemployment fix for the new $10,200 exclusion was going to be updated in the program.

They sell it to you at the wrong time. Then when you need the upgrade you can't find it. What it should do is tell you when it can't handle the K-1 that the ""Premium"" version can.

I have to over ride each calculation with the correct numbers.  I finish.  The program summaries don't update. The totals didn't flow into the State.  All in all I don't trust it.  I'm back to paper.

I prefer TaxCut to Turbo Tax because the lower priced versions include more schedules for the variations taxpayers usually have. If you have straightforward taxes (including itemization, charitable deductions, above the line deductions like moving expenses, home sale gain, children, property taxes, mortgage, IRA or 401k withdrawal, retirement income, K-1 partnership income, want to amend returns, etc.) either program would be fine. If you have certain kinds of investment income requiring special forms, etc you might need to purchase a higher level TurboTax product and should research that in particular. For both programs if you are new to or unclear about deductions for self-employment income and expenses, listed property, home office Deduction rules, rules for written proof of mileage expense, in kind charitable deductions requiring documentation, rules for donating a car, earned income vs. investment income, gambling income, casualty losses, etc. it is difficult to learn enough from either program to understand. Neither program is particularly strong on state taxes based on my experience with California and Hawaii. Both have improved (from discussions in the law firm tax department where I worked and we all do our own taxes.) and it is less common that you have to find, fill out and print your own special state forms.",Prefer TaxCut to TurboTax - For Fairly Straightforward Taxes,Platform: PC DownloadEdition: Deluxe + StateVerified Purchase,

Problems I encountered are as follows, just so others can either be forewarned or commiserate with me:  1)  If you need to Update the program, you must click on 'yes' in the popup to program 'accessing the settings on your device', otherwise the Update won't occur (why they give the user a choice of 'Yes' or 'No' is not helpful.  They should change the popup to indicate that without letting the program access the settings on your device, the Update WILL NOT occur.)  2)  Before you file your return, even though you've already Updated, it will tell you that you have to Update again, AFTER you hit 'Submit' or 'Send' during the e-File process.  The problem here is that by clicking 'Submit' or 'Send', your bank is charged whether or not the e-filing takes place.  When you call H&R Block to request the extra charges be retracted, they'll tell you they're just authorizations.  I am still waiting for the second of two charges to drop off my bank balance, five days after they were applied. 3) Calling for help.  You may have to wait 15+ minutes to talk to someone about problems you're having with their program, just to have them tell you they have to transfer you to the DIY dept.  My total wait time was 105 minutes, between waiting for the initial person who directs my call, to the DIY dept person, to another DIY person.  This was a week before the government filing deadline; I understand they were busy.  Just want to warn folks.  What I don't understand is how the last person I spoke with couldn't explain to me why my state refund took a significant drop after an Update.  While I had that last rep on the phone over a 20 minute period, she couldn't find diddly squat that would explain what was in the Update to change my refund outcome.  So, nope, never again.

The financial institution connections aren't as robust, so I did end up having to enter a lot of data manually into the software.  Ultimately, I got to a result, but it was much more painful than I remembered from years past doing taxes in Turbo Tax.So just to double check the numbers, I did my taxes again in Turbo Tax Online where I don't pay until I file.  It only took me about an hour to do the taxes on Turbo Tax since the interface is much easier and financial institution imports are quicker.  More importantly, I ended up with a higher refund on Turbo Tax.  Digging into the reasons, it appears H&R Block does not properly handle credits for foreign taxes paid properly in my case.  Not sure why.  As a result, I ended up writing off my investment in H&R Block software and ended up filing taxes on Turbo Tax anyways.  The higher refund more than paid for itself.
