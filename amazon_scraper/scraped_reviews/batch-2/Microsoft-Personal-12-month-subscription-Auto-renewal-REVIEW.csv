One of the reasons that I got the bundle deal was because of this 12-month subscription.  I had been subscribing to Microsoft 365 Personal monthly through Microsoft, and getting it for one year from Amazon will save me money.  Plus, I applied a $30 gift card to this purchase, received from trading in an older HD 10, so I saved even more money.Since my monthly subscription was about to renew, I cancelled auto-renew, and waited until Microsoft sent me an e-mail stating my Office had expired.  I then went to ""Memberships & Subscriptions"" in my Amazon account and downloaded Office.  Well, actually, it was all on my desktop anyway, and I just had to sign in at Microsoft for everything to be activated again.  Just took a few minutes.On the Fire, you sign in using your Microsoft account e-mail and password, not your Amazon email and password.  Everything in Office is on the Fire HD 10, but I have no idea how everything will work on the Fire; if it will work just as it does on a desktop or laptop.  I only use Word to write documents and reviews, and that is working exactly the same.  I do nothing elaborate, though.You manage the Office 365 account from your ""Memberships & Subscriptions"" Amazon page, not at Microsoft.  Thus, you go there to turn on or off auto-renew or to cancel your subscription.  I prefer subscribing to things when possible through Amazon.  It makes life easier and everything is in one place.",New Fire HD 10 Bundle Deal 12-Month Subscription . . . .,Platform: Auto-Renewing DownloadEdition: Microsoft 365 PersonalVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

I was deciding between Word 2019 and 365, hoping against hope that the bugs and glitches would have been exterminated. While Microsoft would obviously update 2019 with security updates and other patches I was hoping 365 would lead to a bug-free nirvana.Stupid me. Not only haven't the bugs been quashed, but typical for Microsoft *NEW* bugs have been introduced. For example, now I have the ability to save to OneDrive, which is nice I suppose, but then the damn thing lost all memory of my keyboard customizations. And, for some reason, it keeps losing track of the customizations. There's got to be a way to export them, just so I can re-import them (easily? no, this is Microsoft) every time Word goes stupid on me.I swear, secretaries in Redmond, WA must still use IBM Selectrics.

I was very hesitant, I'm not a fan of cloud applications for software like this as it usually costs more in the long run.  But I saw a price that made sense to try it for a year.  I'm not impressed.  I expected easy access to Microsoft Support - it's tedious at best, aggravating more often than not.  There are features that I use in the Windows version such as sent mail recall - that aren't available on the Mac version.  Funny, I didn't see any notification that features wouldn't be available BEFORE I purchased a license!  And there's an issue with Word 365 in this package, it often locks up when saving a document and the application never recovers or comes back to ""active"".  I have to Force Quit Word, then restart it.  Sometimes my latest edits are still there, sometimes they are not.  I have tried to notify Microsoft about this to find a fix, but I never get a response.  Trying to reach their Tech Spt is often a test of my patience and I end up just shutting down my computer and taking a walk or having a drink to cool off.  Aggravating as hell.  When I had the natively installed Office I didn't have this many problems.  I'm not sure I'll be renewing this cloud version next time.Nov. 13, 2021 update:I continue to find features that don't work or are not available JUST because I am using a Mac.  This has been such an aggravating experience that I hate Microsoft and not only don't want to renew my subscription, but I want a refund!  The problem is, they know they've got people like me over a barrel and Microsoft couldn't care less!  The latest issue is I am job searching and potential employers keep sending me meeting invites with an .ics file, which is the standard calendar format.  When I had the native (local) version of Office and Outlook on my Mac, I could import these calendar invites without issue.  Now that I got suckered into buying a cloud subscription, this and other ""features"", read ""basic capabilities"" are not available to me because I'm on a Mac (with a current OS).  And good luck getting a hold of anyone at MSFT that gives a damn.  You get a support agent in India who can't do much of anything but tell you ""that feature is not available to Mac users"".  I'm beyond frustrated and have to restrain myself from throwing my Mac through the window of the local MSFT office!  (No, not seriously. Geez.) I'm just really, really pissed off that Microsoft doesn't tell you anything about what's NOT available to Mac users before they take your money.  I've lowered my star rating from the original 3 stars to 2 because they just keep making me more and more angry that I bought this crap.",Mac users beware!

Would have been a five star review if the download instructions were more clear. I purchased this download via Amazon versus Microsoft because it was slightly less expensive for the annual sub. I did not know that this would be the primary cause of my headache. Amazon does not have clear instructions listed for this product, if they do I could not find it anywhere. Once purchased you have to assign the license over to yourself. Under manage licenses it gives you two options, one to enter an email to assign the license to or it says assign to me. I entered the email address associated with my Microsoft 365 account, which sends an invitation from Amazon with ""download instructions"". The email says to simply click on the link to redeem the code and sign into your Amazon account. Suffice to say, this did not work for me. I made several attempts before I had to contact customer support. I spoke with 4 people who could not identifya resolution before I was transferred to a young man who helped me out pretty quickly. All I had to do was select assign to me and I was sent the same invitation email to the email address that I have associated with my Amazon account. This time when I clicked on the link it took me to the Amazon sign on page and once signed in it took me to the same manage licenses screen. At the top of the screen there was now a button that I could press that allowed me to access license and it prompted an installer so I could download the Microsoft 365 apps to my MacBook successfully. Simple solution thankfully. Also, I am not sure how the assign to me feature works if the email address that you have on file with Amazon is not the same as the email address that you have with Microsoft 365, luckily for me both email addresses were the same. Amazon should have download information clearly listed under the product description to avoid customer frustration and Microsoft should also make sure that sellers of their product have all of the correct information.
