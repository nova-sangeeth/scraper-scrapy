I always turn off automatic renewal after I purchase, because auto renewal is the most expensive possible way to get a year of Norton coverage.  As soon as I completed my new subscription today, I went to my account to turn off automatic renewal.  It turns out that the customer can't turn it off as they used to be able to do - now I have to ""chat"" with a Norton rep who will actually turn it off for me - if you can convince them!.  And that chat session was a manipulative and frustrating session.  One sign that they know how bad it is, is that you cannot copy or save the chat history, so I'll have to paraphrase it.  It took me seven separate requests to get the Norton rep to agree to turn off auto renewal.  First they want to be sure you understand how valuable it is, then after two or three rounds of that, they tell you that if you turn off auto renewal, you lose the virus protection guarantee that they advertise for Norton 360.  After that, when I continued requesting to turn off auto renew, even then the rep didn't give up on me - ""what if I extend your subscription by 60 days for free?""  No thanks.  ""What if I extend your subscription free by 90 days?""  No thanks!  Now I was quite frustrated that nothing seemed to convince them to turn off auto renew.  So buyer beware - when you read the comments from Norton reps (answering user reviews here on Amazon), where they tell everyone that, don't worry, you can turn off auto renewal, they're not telling the whole story, because turning off auto renewal voids their virus protection guarantee.  And the hassle of arguing with a rep who won't accept the request is really infuriating.  I am going to get a refund for the product (Amazon won't refund it, but Norton says they will, within 60 days) and try another provider.

I've found no reason to switch.  It works, protects me from attacks, and is easy to use.  I run a manual full-machine scan once a week.  I've never encountered a virus having gotten onto my machine.This particular product auto-renews, which some commentators have found intrusive.  I do, too.  It's very easy to turn off, however.  After you install the product go to the ""My Subscription"" area of your Norton.com online account.  In the upper right-hand area of the screen you'll see an ""Automatic renewal"" toggle.  Just switch it to  ""OFF"".  You'll subsequently see a screen asking you to state reason why you turned off this feature.  I chose ""I prefer not to respond"", clicked ""CONTINUE"" at the bottom, and the feature was turned off.  Simple.The installation of the product, as I was already using Norton Security Standard from last year, took all of two minutes.  Now I'm protected for another year.As I noted, I've been using the Norton suites for years.  It may slow my machine a bit when I'm browsing, but I've found via using TASK MANAGER to examine the CPU usage that generally Chrome is hogging the memory, not Norton.  And it may slow the boot-up of my desktop but, again, it's a small price to pay for online security and I don't find it annoying.I feel completely protected by Norton; my experience has informed and validated that feeling.  No complaints.UPDATE (Nov. 2020):  I renewed my Norton subscription last month.  I still had a couple weeks remaining on it and yet, after I renewed, the expiry date didn't adjust to add on those two remaining weeks.  I was miffed.  Logged on to the Norton site and eventually learned (through a chat session with a rep and also a subsequent call) that LifeLock bought Symantec during late 2019 or 2020 and has a policy of not adding on the remaining days when you renew the subscription.  This seems underhanded to me.  Anyway, I called a rep and he quickly adjusted my expiry date to include those extra couple weeks remaining on my previous subscription.Be warned: either wait until the day of expiration to renew or, if you renew earlier, be prepared to waste 30 minutes or so slogging through the LifeLock customer service system to claw back the remaining days.  The annoyance was not quite enough to induce me to cancel my subscription.  If this sort of thing keeps up, however, it will be.LifeLock reps, if you're reading this: be honest in your operations.

So I have been using Norton for years.  I always turn off the auto renewal option after I enter a new key code from a new purchase such as this one.  So given all the previous comment, I decided to call Norton ahead of time prior to purchasing this product for another year.  Call went very smoothly, they confirmed that the cancel auto renew option was still there however it will not show if you have already set up non renew from the previous year.Until you actually enter the new product key and go through the minor install process to renew, the cancel auto renewal option will not show up.  So I had 4 days to renew.  I just purchased this product, amazon instantly sends you a link to click and follow the instructions.  Or you can do as I did, logged in ahead of time, went to my covered pc and clicked to enter new product key.  As soon as I did that, the renewal installation process began.  Same as if you woud've clicked the link.  Either way.  Once I was done and all set up, I noticed that the ""My Subscription"" button all of a sudden showed up giving me the instant option to cancel auto renewal.So in the end, everything worked well, everything was OK and it went pretty smoothly overall.  As of now, when you try to cancel the renewal, a pop comes up asking to stay and not cancel and in return it offers you 30 additional days of coverage after 5 days.  I have no problem waiting 5 days to set up non renewal after the fact for the additional 30 days.  I think their hope is that you forget all about it.  I assure I won't, however if you are the type that might, then forget the extra free 30 days and set up non renewal right away.Hopes this helps to clear everything up and calms everyone down with the freaking out reviews.  Trust me, I would be the first to go nuts on Norton if I couldn't do this.  I would go to another protection provider, but I like Norton and everything went well.Finally I want to let everyone know that on the phone they told me that my additional 4 days I had to renew would stack up on top of the new year renewal, THIS IS NOT TRUE !!  As soon as you enter the new product key or set up the renewal, the new year starts as of the day you renew and whatever days were left are lost.  So my recommendation is to wait till the last day or 2 before the renewal expires.  I also recommend to not make the purchase till your ready to renew right there and then to not risk some kind of 20 day expiration limit that someone talked about in another review.  I just did everything all at once just now from purchasing it, to installing/ renewing, to this review.  Everything worked well !!!",Don't Stress !!!

The interface is pretty straight forward and I trust that my systems are protected.  I especially like the password vault and VPN that are included.  Combined, it is a great value, enough so that I purchase my annual licenses, over using the anti-virus software  provided for free by my ISP.That said, the software key purchase is a great deal, only costing me $2 and change a month for 5 computers, however, the cost of ""auto-renew"" is a crime, coming in at 5-6 times the cost of the initial key purchase.It is simple to turn off the auto renew setting, once you find it, (click support and look through the list).A chat box will come up, but just close it and it will allow you to proceed with turning off auto renew in a single click.If you cancel the auto renew, you do lose access to their system optimizer (PC only) but its not really a game changer.  If you would like to use it, just remember to set a reminder for around 5 weeks before it is due to renew so you are sure to turn it off, then come here and purchase a new subscription, enter the key in your account settings, and your good to go.I write these details as I have seen other say it is a huge hassle to cancel auto renew, and you won't get updates if you turn it off- neither are true (I literally JUST did it).Bottom line tho-I personally think its the best anti-virus and password vault out there, its easy to use and keeps my computer safe.  Its just not worth paying multiple time more for the concenience of auto-renew.

I decided on the former. If I could have given three and a half stars, I would have. For years I had been using the 5-licence version of Norton Security Deluxe. I always gave it a high rating. But this year I noticed that ""Norton Security Deluxe"" was retired in favor of ""Norton 360 Deluxe,"" and I have to say that I am not in love with a product that I believe is harder to use and more intrusive. As a former IT person, I am usually able to adjust pretty easily to certain things but, after a week of using 360, I still find it hard to locate certain features and settings and am a bit irritated by all the alerts. Eventually I am able to guess correctly at the location of certain items, but this far into the computer age I would have thought that the developers would get this right.Yes, I am also aware of the automatic renewal irritations that others have mentioned, but I have known about this for years, and so that doesn't bother me anymore. And I have no complaints at all about 360's ability to protect my devices. But as far as ease-of-use goes, the current incarnation of this product is not an improvement.Added six weeks later: This version of Norton seems to be a lot more intrusive than previously. I particularly dislike the forced backup protocols and the intrusive messages. Further, at various points I have been forced to log into the Norton web site to continue with whatever they are requesting. I still have confidence in the product's protective ability, but I have to say that its interface and intrusions are starting to get on my nerves.",Harder to use than previously,"Platform: Download Code [12 Month, with Auto-Renewal]Verified Purchase",9 people found this helpful

I do a ton of web surfing, visiting many different types of sites -- including some that use sketchy pop-ups, click-baiting, etc. -- and I've never gotten a virus.  Not once. Norton has done an excellent job of keeping my electronic devices safe, which is exactly what it's supposed to do.  And with their products regularly offered on Amazon at heavily discounted prices, my wallet is almost as happy as my computer.  Is it perfect?  Nope -- no software is.  But the positives have always outweighed the negatives.I always find myself chuckling and rolling my eyes at the numerous one-star reviews that are invariably piled onto products like this.  A few folks have legitimate complaints (though rarely serious enough to support their knee-jerk single star ratings), but the majority of them are unjustified rants.  They usually boil down to:""I can't get this to load/work on my computer.""  I've never run into this problem, having downloaded it to numerous devices.  I'm guessing you're doing something wrong.  And if you aren't, I regularly see Norton reps monitoring the reviews and reaching out immediately to help.""Norton is forcing me to sign up for their ridiculous auto-renewal.""  Yes, it is annoying, and the auto-renewal prices have always been outrageous.  But here's a super-secret hint, folks: you can turn off auto-renewal as soon as you finish registering the product!  Just go to your Norton account and click (or double-click if necessary) the toggle switch to turn auto-renewal off.  It will beg and plead with you not to...but stay strong, you will get through it.  And then it's done.  Problem solved.""I don't want to give them my credit card information.""  I'll never understand why some people think this is such a big deal.  You've already given Amazon your credit card info, so clearly you have no problem with it being electronically transmitted to a soulless mega-corporation.  So what, then?  You think Norton is going to use it to buy a private island in the south Pacific?  You're going to turn off auto-renewal (see above), so you aren't going to be charged for anything.  Having to enter the number is a minor irritant at worst.  If it's just a matter of principle for you, fine, then don't use their software...but giving it a one-star rating for that reason alone is laughable.""It sux"" (or some equally eloquent variation thereof).  Wow, super helpful feedback there.  Which other antivirus software do you prefer, and why?  I'm certainly open to considering other options.  But I've actually tried other products, and I've usually ended up regretting it for one reason or another.  Norton has yet to disappoint me in any significant way.OK, enough of my own rant.

When I clicked on adding it to another device it took me to the Google play store and asked me to pay $90 for a download. I ended up spending more than four hours with customer service from both Amazon and Norton to straighten it out. Neither could fix the issue. Finally, Norton had me uninstall my existing version of Norton and then upload a new version from the Play Store. Norton has gotten to be a major pain. Always sending me notifications to add more products from it and LifeLock. And now this issue, which others have complained about, too. This is probably my last year with Norton. It's a big nuisance. And every year they take a perfectly good product and ruin it by adding features I don't want and changing its name.

Some users now report that if you uncheck this, it terminates your service & updates. You can leave it on then, and uncheck it at the end of the year renewal & see what happens. I noticed when I first checked my account & profile today at My Norton, there was a ""renew"" button to the right of my current 2020 subscription (and maybe because auto renew was turn off). When I clicked the ""renew link,"" it said $34.99 I think. I have not checked to see how this displays since my purchases & renewal on Amazon. But after having Norton NIS for 15+ years, they seem to change their My Norton panels almost every year. Typically the price changes based on how close you are to the end of subscription date. My advice to others is to click this ""renew"" button and see what price it shows. And then compare that to the price on Amazon. Even on Amazon, the renewal price can vary quite a bit from week to week. So check both. And if renewing at Norton is ONLY a few dollars more, I'd renew there. I think it's one less step. Good luck.

For me, I’m not sure what it is about downloading Norton software form other than the Norton.  I think because it doesn’t always turn out so well.  Today my Norton subscription formally expired.  If you’re like me, you’re constantly being hounded that your subscription is about to expire, the sky is falling and the world is coming to an end.  Norton’s renewal price is 89.99 or something ridiculous like that (if you do let your license expire, a day or two later they will drop the price 30 bucks.  It’s still not a great deal and could be risky, but I took my chances).As expected my last day renewal price was 89.99, this time down from 139.99!  What a deal, sign me up, nope!  Until today, I’ve never purchased a license from Amazon at the extreme bargain price of 27.99. Why, because something always screws up and you spend your entire day trying to fix it.  Today I took the plunge and it couldn’t have been easier!Open your existing Norton account (if you have one).  Download the software from Amazon.  Open the email the mail you’ll receive regarding your purchase, hit the redeem now.  An .exe file will be saved to your downloads folder.  Open the folder, double click the newly down loaded file, accept the conditions and wah-la, you’re on your way.  Everything went great, even added a license for my son.  Don’t fret about canceling the automatic renewal.  Unless you hate the product and want out, give it some time.  Later on (but don’t forget), open your account, go to setting, you’ll find the auto-renewal, turn it off.

After explaining that I wanted it set of off I was brow beat for a good 20 minutes.  The rep finally agreed to change it and said that I would get an email in a few minutes.  I waited about 2 hours and never received an email, so I signed back into my account only to find out that it hadn't been changed.  I tried doing it again, and the bar still wouldn't move.

The only way to avoid that is to 1) After installing it, promptly go to the Norton website and find the link to cancel automatic renewal, 2) Navigate through all the ads and carefully find the link to cancel each time, 3) Purchase the product at retail again when the year is up and reinstall it on each device – a process that is cumbersome and confusing.
