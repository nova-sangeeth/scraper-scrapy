On the plus side, Windows Home installed easily and didn't take forever to do so.  I use Windows 10 pro at work, and for my purposes on a home computer, this Windows Home addition works just as well as the pro version.  Minuses: I don't know why this software isn't available via download rather than on a disc, particularly with so many new laptops not having a cd/dvd drive. My problem with the product key was that I couldn't find it.  The packaging provided no instructions as to where the key could be found and the MS website said there should have been a slip inside the disc sleeve, but there wasn't.  I called Amazon (MS says you have to deal with the seller if you don't by it directly from MS.  Amazon rep was polite but couldn't help me with finding the code, but quickly offered to replace it or refund the cost, so I went with the refund thinking I was tired of messing with it.  And of course MS makes it clear it won't provide any support involving a human rep, and the web site information turned out to be wrong.  Finally found out after searching many web posts on various sited that the key was under some gray ""scratch off""  stuff on the front of the inside packaging.  Fortunately, I was able to call Amazon support back before the refund was completely processed and got that fixed. Some instructions from MS would have been nice and would have saved me an hour.  Maybe MS thinks everyone will know to treat the CD cover slip like a scratch-off lottery ticket in order to find the product key, but I find the total lack of instructions for finding the key in the purchased package and the incorrect information posted on the MS website to be unacceptable.","Product key seriously annoying, MS responsiveness is unacceptable, but OS performance is OK.",Style: HomeVerified Purchase,17 people found this helpful

Windows 10 seems to be poorly organized in that to find ordinary things requires using searches.  Some of this I believe is due to its wanting you to use the cloud to store your information.  In additon Microsoft keeps installing new applications along with the OS updates without asking if it is OK to install each one. There seems to be two desktops, downloads and documents.  One under your user diectory and one somewhere else.  Often I have to manually go into drive c:  and users to find my actual files.  Though there are some advantages in storing information in the cloud when you go from machine to machine, most of the time it is of little benefit and suffer from internet bandwidth bottle necks.

When you press the Windows symbol (where the start button used to be) you get an alphabetical list of your programs (oops, I guess they are all ""apps"" now). There are a whole bunch that you probably never had before. Some can be ""uninstalled"" while others (part of the Microsoft revenue stream?) cannot be removed at all. My guess is that the majority of the installation process is loading all the ""apps"".  Since I do not have, nor do I ever want, a smart phone most of this stuff is junk as far as I'm concerned.  Finally, Win-10 in pushy: it wants you to do all your stuff in their cloud so those functions are easy to access. Getting to some of your old programs (sorry, ""Apps"") have to be searched out using the Windows button in the lower left hand corner of the screen. Finding your data files for backups (you do regular backups - right?) is a bit daunting.Outlook, Excel, Word, et cetera do work in the Win-10 environment.That being said, I can only rate this a four because it is really not intended for desktop use and there are multiple opportunities to ""accidentally"" screw things up by telling the system that you are on a phone or tablet.

But while I waited for it to get delivered, I did a little research and I decided to create a USB bootable key and try that instead (Google: 'Window 10 media creation tool'). Booting the software from the USB key resulted in the program accepting the original key sent, and a full and satisfactory install of the software. Why the install software included on the disk didn't accept the key when the USB key version did? I have no ideal... but if you're having problems installing from the disk you might try this. One note: after the installer copies the files to the selected hard drive and does some installation it will tell you Windows needs to restart, and give you a 10-second countdown. REMOVE THE USB KEY at this time, or after the restart it will just boot into the install program again.Now I just have to figure you how to return the unneeded, unused replacement version of the software without having to pay for the shipping on it...","IF YOU""RE PRODUCT KEY DOESN'T WORK, TRY THIS!",Style: HomeVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

Windows does push automatic downloads without your permission, games like candy crush, minecraft, etc. show up without authorization, but there are easy ways to disable this feature.Performance is excellent and seems to perform better than windows 7. Worth the upgrade once you disable all the marketing nonsense.At time of this review, if you are making the jump from an older version of windows to 10, you should be able to do this for free. You can download the windows 10 installer from Microsoft and begin installation, once you finish the setup process, windows should automatically detect the key you used and windows 10 should be activated automatically. Windows will be bound to your motherboard, so you would have to get a new version if you change computers in the future. Worked for me twice so far using my old Windows activation keys from win7. One time I just updated from an old version of windows and didn't need to activate the key, it pulled my old windows 7 key automatically. The second time I did a hard reset and fresh install, during activation I used my other windows 7 activation key and it had no issues setting me up for windows 10.I wish I knew this before purchasing this windows cd. I can't guarantee it will still work, but it looks like Microsoft wants you to upgrade so they can earn more money marketing your data out and push paid games like candy crush to your desktop probably for a fee from the aps company.This CD is great and legit. The packaging was official, arrived on time, and the code was valid. I believe this is an OEM version, which means it binds to your motherboard.

It worked well for a couple of days after that, too, but then it just stopped working and said that the product key had been used already. So I called Microsoft, spent some time on hold, and was eventually able to get it working again. I was still pretty frustrated by this, though, because a sealed copy of windows should have a good product key in it.

I built my own PC in 2017 and installed this from scratch on a fresh hard drive. When I first installed everything worked great until I had to activate Windows. I scratched off the thing on the packaging, entered the 25 digit key, and it told me that I had an invalid key. I figured I had gotten scammed. I was pretty bummed until I realized I could still do most of what I wanted with Windows not activated (mostly just locking personalization options). Since I was already outside of the return window, I decided to just roll with it.Fast forward to now (beginning of 2021) when I was thinking I should really buy a legit copy of Windows. I figured I would poke around in the activation screen one last time, just to see if I mis-entered the key the 20 or so times way back when. I looked at the ""Update Product key"" section and pressed a button that said ""My hardware has recently changed"", wondering what that was for. Lo and behold, the thing goes out to Microsoft's servers and finds the digital license linked to my Microsoft account. I don't know what changed or why, but I now have a working key. Maybe it was because I built my own PC that it got thrown off, maybe I'm just an idiot and I needed to do it that way from the get go, or maybe there is no rhyme or reason and the whims of the product key gods swayed in my favor. Whatever the reason, I'm back to add a few stars to my review.That being said, you are still probably better off just buying it directly from Microsoft.

All I needed was the Windows 10 license. This provided the license at a ""reasonable"" cost... cough cough.I am an IT professional. I am a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer. I've been in this business since the eighties. As far as Windows goes, 10 is arguably the best yet. However, the past 5 consecutive upgrades have broken Windows for thousands of users. While 10 is more secure than previous versions of Windows, it is no less susceptible to viruses and malware. That ""reasonable"" cost is considering the cost of a Windows license. There is a MUCH better OS out there. It is far more secure, virtually impervious to viruses and malware, easier to use, faster, more customizable, runs everything you need, and it's FREE. I use Linux Mint Cinnamon on my recent computers, and Lubuntu on older or underpowered hardware. I do not use Windows any longer. However, I have not been able to convince all my customers to switch... yet. I honestly believe Microsoft's reign is coming to an end. I would not be surprised to see them file bankruptcy within the next few years.","It's Windoze. If you must buy a license, this will do it. Do yourself a favor and try Linux Mint Cinnamon...

Using a Gigabyte GA-Z170x-Gaming 3 motherboard, with no previous OS installed. The cd key worked without trouble as well. Important buyer information, if you ask me. So yes, this disc will work just fine for installation. Now for my review of Windows 10 after having used it for over a month...Pros: You get your familiar desktop/start panel back, huge improvement over the awful Windows 8 design. Also, Windows 10 boots up FAST. I'm using 8gb DDR4 RAM in my rig, with an Intel Core i5 6600k, and for me, it boots up in about 10-15 seconds. After years of waiting at minimum a couple minutes for older Windows OS's to boot up, this is a HUGE pro. Another pro is the customization that Windows 10 allows you.Cons: My biggest complaint, Windows 10 does not natively play DVD's! You cannot pop in a movie and watch it with Windows Media Player or the Tv/Movies app. You must purchase a ""dvd player"" from Microsoft's app store for $15. This is the most absurd thing that Microsoft has quite possibly ever done. Anyone purchasing Windows 10 to install on a new system will have this problem. If you're upgrading from 7 or 8, then I believe they do include dvd playback at no cost. If you're paying for Windows 10 though, it's a RIPOFF to charge another fee just so that we can play our movies. You can try downloading VLC media player to have a free means for dvd playback. But do not download the app version from the Windows app store, as it's just as useless as Windows Media Player. Other cons are that Windows heavily uses apps for this OS, which feels cheapened like you're using some crappy mobile device. Also, you will get some advertisements for apps or games, which should NOT be included in a paid version of the OS.All in all, 3/5 stars from me. Fast boot, nice look, some returns to familiar OS's prior to 8, customization, and stability thus far, makes this a decent OS, far superior to Windows 8. However, lack of free, integrated DVD playback is an absurdity that I cannot wrap my head around.","A Windows 7 and 8 hybrid, fast boot, nice look, dvd installs fine, but prepare to spend 15 bucks for dvd playback!",Style: HomeVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful
