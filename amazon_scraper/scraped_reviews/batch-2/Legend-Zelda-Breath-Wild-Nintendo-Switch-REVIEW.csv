I bought a Switch just to play this game and I do not regret my purchase. I'm going to go over pros and cons to make this review a little easier to read.PROS:+ HUGE OPEN WORLD - Lots of interesting places and things to discover. It's quite exhilarating to scale a mountain in order to get a better view of everything around you and then paraglide to points of interest. If you can see a place on the map, you can get to it.+ COMBAT EXPERIMENTATION - Combat experimentation is fun and rewarding, for awhile (more explanation in 'cons' section).+ FUN AND VARIED COMBAT (FOR AWHILE) - Different enemy types are interesting and have specific tactics that clearly telegraph their moves making combat a rewarding learning experience and almost never feels cheap.+ RPG ELEMENTS - The RPG elements fit very nicely into the Zelda universe and give the game a lot of depth. Mountable horses have different stats, enemies can have different elemental types along with stronger variations, weapons, armor, and shields have wildly different stats and abilities, food and elixirs provide different buffs, etc.+ GAME DIFFICULTY - The game is relatively difficult compared to previous Zelda games. You really have to assess combat situations before entering the fray and many enemies are punishing. You will die, many times, but you do learn, with time, and with learning comes triumph and satisfaction. DLC adds Master Mode for the most hardcore players or those who found Normal too easy.+ COOKING SYSTEM - Cooking system is deep and rewards experimentation. Cooking not only allows for the crafting of meals and elixirs which gives you numerous buffs, but it's also one of the best ways to make money.+ WEAPON DURABILITY - Weapon and shield durability forces you to continually hunt for new gear and keeps combat interesting and tense. While I didn't think I would like this system at first, it makes for a much more engaging game than just getting a single, over-powered item and just relying on that the rest of the game, which would get boring, imo.+ SHRINES - There's over 120 'shrines' which are peppered all over the map which act like mini-dungeons. They usually can be completed in 10 minutes or less and usually involve the use of several of Link's Runes (that you get at the beginning of the game) that give you the ability to move metallic objects from a distance, throw bombs, summon ice pillars, or even freeze objects and apply force to them to launch into enemies or to other places to help solve puzzles. I love these shrines because they're fun to solve, and due to the game's physics engine, many can be solved in ways the developers probably didn't intend (look up YouTube videos on it). Shrines are short enough that they're not a huge time investment like normal Zelda dungeons that used to demand an hour+ of your time to complete, making them ideal for short gaming sessions.+ NO HAND HOLDING - Doesn't explain much, doesn't hold your hand, and expects you to learn everything from the world, NPCs, and experimentation.CONS:- BARREN FEELING OPEN-WORLD - The world feels very barren and empty, much of the time. Many say the map is 'dense' but I don't think that's an accurate word to describe it. The map is loaded with things to do, but there is lots of empty space between those points of interest. Think if you took the map of Skyrim (a game I would call 'dense') and expanded it by 3 times the size, including time to travel between points of interest. Horses don't really help with traversal especially when you're moving across mountainous or rocky terrain.- COMBAT GETS STALE - Combat experimentation becomes less effective as you become stronger. Ambushes with bombs, chu chu jellies, stasis, etc, all become less and less rewarding as enemies become stronger. Before, a carefully aimed bomb could kill an enemy, outright, or roll into barrels which would take out an entire encampment, now a bomb does roughly 5% damage and most other means are hardly worth the effort over just using brute-force. For a game that really rewarded this kind of behavior at the start, I was bummed that I couldn't rely on those tactics later in the game, adding to the combat feeling stale and repetitive after awhile.- CAN'T SUMMON HORSES FROM ANYWHERE - Horses cannot be summoned from anywhere. The DLC solves this with 2 different solutions, but it should have been in the base game and been an early quest/reward before you spend 50+ hours exploring the map. This was super frustrating to me when walking to Gerudo town, which ended up being close to 25 minutes of walking/running from the nearest shrine. A horse would have made this trek much more bearable but there were no stables nearby to even take it out of.- INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL UI - Inventory management and the menu UI could use a little work. While I loved having so many interesting items and ingredients to discover and experiment with, moving through the menus got tedious, especially when you have multiple pages of stuff to sort through or when you find new, better weapons/shields and have to go back into your menus to drop some to make space. Menus felt cluttered and even after 80 hours, I would still fumble through menus trying to do specific things.- PERFORMANCE AND LOAD TIMES - The game runs pretty well a majority of the time, but there are certain places where it will chug, specifically when there's lots of particle effects on-screen or there's a lot of things to render. This also makes load times get kind of old, as it can take up to 20 seconds to load into new areas or even just reload the area you are in, after dying. Even dying in a shrine results in a 10 second reload, which is baffling since they're not in the open-world and shouldn't take that long to render, especially when they've already been rendered before your death.- GRAPHICS - While the game looks pretty good most of the time, there's other times that the hardware limitations really show, like when you're trekking across big meadows or rocky mountains with little detail. It looks really good for a handheld system, but doesn't quite hold up to console standards, even compared to last gen.- EXPLAINS NOTHING - While I love that the game doesn't hold your hand, I was equally frustrated by not having a clue how to do certain things. While a purist would argue that all the answers are SOMEWHERE in the game or that you should just experiment, someone like me just doesn't have the patience to play 90% of the games content to then find out that a certain ability will significantly help map traversal and reduce travel time. I want to know these things up-front or at the latest, halfway through the game, since getting an ability to improve travel time feels less rewarding when I've already slowly trekked through a vast majority of the map at 60 hours. DLC rewards are not as great if you have nearly completed and covered the entire base game... what's the use of a horse or motorcycle you can summon anywhere if you don't have anything left to explore?Anyways, I absolutely love this game. Given the number of rather large gripes that I had with it, I felt like a 4 is a fair score. I really look forward to the next game but I hope people can acknowledge and admit the game's shortcomings, otherwise, these things won't be fixed in order to give us the most refined and amazing follow-up that we all are already salivating for.",Near perfection.

I've put in maybe 30 hours to date, and I've gotten basically nowhere. And I don't really feel like moving on at this point.This is a huge, HUGE game. I've explored maybe 10%. The graphics are excellent, the soundtrack is great if a bit minimalist. It's big, it's WIDE open, and it's super-involved. Weapons break on you. Stocks of ammunition (i.e. arrows) run out. If you want to eat, you need to collect and then cook your food. If you want to cook your food you need to find yourself some fire. And on, and on.Big, open, involved -- all of these are probably plusses for a lot of gamers, and this game has certainly received its fair share of great reviews. But here's the thing: I'm an adult, with a real life and responsibilities. And every time I sit down in front of this game I spend two or three hours collecting supplies and cooking food and fighting various monsters, all without making much progress. Why bother?!Breath of the Wild, maybe it's not you. Maybe it's me. But you're no Link Between Worlds. You're certainly no Ocarina of Time.

That was one of the most challenging and rewarding games I had ever finished.  I've not played video games for over 25 years until getting the switch and BOTW.  I am amazed at how much gaming has improved and how much I've missed out!  I like that this game is not all about fighting and is not too violent and gruesome.  The game is fun for all ages and even my youngest 5 year old boy enjoys playing it, although he mostly just explores the villages and experiment with cooking.  The biggest problem with this game is that it is so addictive that we'll play it all day and don't want to do anything else.

EASILY.It’s huge and pretty and has a lot of innovative stuff never seen in a zelda, but almost every single thing they added is a misfire.  First, it’s barren...it’s a giant huge amazing world with NOTHING IN IT.  No, i dont count boring little pig monsters or re-skins of boring little pig monsters, or endless crafting things that don’t make anything remotely cool, or another melee weapon that breaks after 3 swings.  These are not content.  Second, it’s repetitive.  They got rid of big themed dungeons...I’m honestly not sure why but Im not against it if they did something cool. They did not.  They made a bunch, maybe hundreds, of small dungeons that feel incredibly joyless and give you nothing cool.There’s just nothing to build to, nothing story wise (the whole story is told through flashbacks)Cannot believe people are pretending this is a good game.

We have made it to Hateno, which I'm guessing is less than a tenth of the overall game. Let me just say that it is insanely good. It is epic. It is like all the imaginings I had as a kid playing dice RPGs. The freedom of being able to explore such a large, rich, intricate and gorgeous world is fantastic. Climbing mountains, gliding down into charming villages, galloping through open countryside on horseback, running along wooded trails, hunting, foraging and cooking, dodging thunderstorms, conquering shrines. Even just gazing at the landscape from the top of a tower is just awesome.This game is so good we have to set timers to remind us to take a break.If only we could just climb in ;-)",Truly Epic,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,78 people found this helpful

That's when I played Zelda for the first time. I was a toddler and still remember what an adventure it was. Since there was little text I could still play even though I had no one to read it to me. It was my driving force to learn to read and count. It was my favorite game year after year. Now 30 years later and this is almost the game I imagined from staring at the manual art and blocky pixels on that limited palette of the NES. I have not bought a Nintendo game in over a decade, and this was the first game that made me buy a nintendo console since the Cube. The world is vast and feels old giving a real feel of a adventure, the combat is ingauging, the difficulty is perfect, physics are the best around, cooking is accually entertaining and worth while, the ability to climb really adds something, the art design is great at hiding the 720p/900p resolution, and the ammount of things to see is awesome, the puzzles are well done for the most part, and the lack of direction harkens back to the NES game. On the downside the story is not in the league of say Witcher 3, the music can feel to subdued in my opinion, voice acting is sparse and should have been fully voiced or not at all, and the weapons do break to often. The gameplay makes up for all of this though. I am addicted to the gameplay, and you set the pace. I'm typically a 60fps4k pc gamer, but this game is just done so well. So is this game a nostalgia trip. YES! But it is an amazing experience. So here we are 30 years after the original golden cartridge that first really got me into video games and this is a worthy successor. My 4yo son sits with me when I let him. I help him play, and read him the text. It is one of his favorite things to do. He is starting to sounding out words with me and counting his money. Though he has me to read to him.

I have been playing it for awhile and I hate it, for various reasons.  First, it's an open world game with no sense of direction that I've found.  Everything is so vague and there's no way you will figure out this game without consulting the internet for QnA and walkthroughs.  One thing I absolutely HATE when trying to play a game.  When I want to play a game, I don't want to have to keep stepping away from the screen to go log on my computer to figure out...  what do I do next?  Where do I go?  How do I make this recipe?For example, in the very beginning, you need to complete 3 trials in 3 shrines.  Well that's all fine and dandy, except the 3rd shrine is located atop a mountain that is cold.  You can't get there without some way to keep yourself warm.  I wandered around this area countless hours until I finally by luck stumbled upon some old diary that said something about making a recipe that keeps you warm.  Who would have known?  You will have no idea until you stumble upon this isolated small shack and find the diary.  But doesn't give you the recipe!!!  You have to figure it out on your own because the stupid old man wrote the diary forgot the final recipe and it's up to you to figure that out.  Yeah good luck with that.  The first ingredient is peppers which you can find and pick.  The 2nd recipe is raw meat.  which takes quite awhile to figure out how to even find.  You have to wander around some more until you find some boars in a forest to kill.  As for the 3rd ingredient, you will be a week putting together all sorts of different combinations to find the 3rd is a fish.  You have no way of figuring this out unless you get on the internet and look it up.I spent hours and hours just wandering around in this game figuring out what I'm supposed to do.  I cannot STAND games like that.  Just wander around until by luck you stumble upon something related to your quest.  At which point, you need to blindly wander around some more.I don't know about the people who wrote the positive reviews, but I have a life.  I have a job, I have a family and a home.  What I DON'T have, is countless hours to wander around doing nothing.  Hours and hours and hours trying to figure out where the shrines are and how to make some stupid recipe that you have to guess on your own.  And this is only the beginning of the game.  I don't even want to think about what it's like in the later levels.Now that that's out of the way, my other complaint is about the weapons.  You have sticks, swords, spears, bows, clubs all sorts  of weapons.  Cool right?  Except they are  all junk.  After you kill a couple of goblins, the weapon breaks.  In the middle of a fight and all of a sudden, your sword has broken!!!  Then you have to fart around the menu to equip another sword.  You swipe it a few times and oops!  It's broke too!  Let's try the club.  Broke!  Equip the spear.  Broke!!!  I'm tired of hoarding swords and spears in my bag because they keep breaking.  And your SOL if they all break.  Yeah you can't fight without a weapon.  Link just looks at his empty hand like he's stupid.  Just ball up your fist and punch the goblin in the face or kick him where it counts.  Nope he just looks at his hand.  So what do you do when you break all your weapons?  You guessed it.  Run away.  Then you have to waaaaaander around blindly until you stumble on an axe or something.  Same with the bows.  They break too.And what happens during a boss fight?  SAME THING.  You dodge his attack and mash him a round then your weapon breaks and he has hardly any damage done at all.  But then you have to go to the menu and equip another weapon.  In the meantime, by the time that's done, hes coming in for a other attack.  Same sequence.  Dodge, attack, weapon breaks, replaced.  But when he hits you ONCE, its game over and you have to continue and sit through the load screen.  Not to mention the music is freaking pathetic and annoying.Weapons breaking, constantly healing after one hit, This is incredibly stupid to have to do when you are in the middle of an intense fight where you need to focus on what your doing rather than mess around swapping out weapons that keep breaking.Forget this.  Going to game stop tomorrow to trade this in.  I don't have time for this kind of garbage. I bought a Nintendo switch just for this game, because I read it was a good game.  Looks like I'm putting the switch away and hooking my PS4 back up and put back in my latest Final Fantasy game, where at least my weapons don't break, I don't die in one hit and I have some sort of sense of direction and what I'm supposed to do.Fing garbage.

DLC rewards are not as great if you have nearly completed and covered the entire base game... what's the use of a horse or motorcycle you can summon anywhere if you don't have anything left to explore?Anyways, I absolutely love this game. Given the number of rather large gripes that I had with it, I felt like a 4 is a fair score. I really look forward to the next game but I hope people can acknowledge and admit the game's shortcomings, otherwise, these things won't be fixed in order to give us the most refined and amazing follow-up that we all are already salivating for.",Near perfection.

That's when I played Zelda for the first time. I was a toddler and still remember what an adventure it was. Since there was little text I could still play even though I had no one to read it to me. It was my driving force to learn to read and count. It was my favorite game year after year. Now 30 years later and this is almost the game I imagined from staring at the manual art and blocky pixels on that limited palette of the NES. I have not bought a Nintendo game in over a decade, and this was the first game that made me buy a nintendo console since the Cube. The world is vast and feels old giving a real feel of a adventure, the combat is ingauging, the difficulty is perfect, physics are the best around, cooking is accually entertaining and worth while, the ability to climb really adds something, the art design is great at hiding the 720p/900p resolution, and the ammount of things to see is awesome, the puzzles are well done for the most part, and the lack of direction harkens back to the NES game. On the downside the story is not in the league of say Witcher 3, the music can feel to subdued in my opinion, voice acting is sparse and should have been fully voiced or not at all, and the weapons do break to often. The gameplay makes up for all of this though. I am addicted to the gameplay, and you set the pace. I'm typically a 60fps4k pc gamer, but this game is just done so well. So is this game a nostalgia trip. YES! But it is an amazing experience. So here we are 30 years after the original golden cartridge that first really got me into video games and this is a worthy successor. My 4yo son sits with me when I let him. I help him play, and read him the text. It is one of his favorite things to do. He is starting to sounding out words with me and counting his money. Though he has me to read to him.

I have been playing it for awhile and I hate it, for various reasons.  First, it's an open world game with no sense of direction that I've found.  Everything is so vague and there's no way you will figure out this game without consulting the internet for QnA and walkthroughs.  One thing I absolutely HATE when trying to play a game.  When I want to play a game, I don't want to have to keep stepping away from the screen to go log on my computer to figure out...  what do I do next?  Where do I go?  How do I make this recipe?For example, in the very beginning, you need to complete 3 trials in 3 shrines.  Well that's all fine and dandy, except the 3rd shrine is located atop a mountain that is cold.  You can't get there without some way to keep yourself warm.  I wandered around this area countless hours until I finally by luck stumbled upon some old diary that said something about making a recipe that keeps you warm.  Who would have known?  You will have no idea until you stumble upon this isolated small shack and find the diary.  But doesn't give you the recipe!!!  You have to figure it out on your own because the stupid old man wrote the diary forgot the final recipe and it's up to you to figure that out.  Yeah good luck with that.  The first ingredient is peppers which you can find and pick.  The 2nd recipe is raw meat.  which takes quite awhile to figure out how to even find.  You have to wander around some more until you find some boars in a forest to kill.  As for the 3rd ingredient, you will be a week putting together all sorts of different combinations to find the 3rd is a fish.  You have no way of figuring this out unless you get on the internet and look it up.I spent hours and hours just wandering around in this game figuring out what I'm supposed to do.  I cannot STAND games like that.  Just wander around until by luck you stumble upon something related to your quest.  At which point, you need to blindly wander around some more.I don't know about the people who wrote the positive reviews, but I have a life.  I have a job, I have a family and a home.  What I DON'T have, is countless hours to wander around doing nothing.  Hours and hours and hours trying to figure out where the shrines are and how to make some stupid recipe that you have to guess on your own.  And this is only the beginning of the game.  I don't even want to think about what it's like in the later levels.Now that that's out of the way, my other complaint is about the weapons.  You have sticks, swords, spears, bows, clubs all sorts  of weapons.  Cool right?  Except they are  all junk.  After you kill a couple of goblins, the weapon breaks.  In the middle of a fight and all of a sudden, your sword has broken!!!  Then you have to fart around the menu to equip another sword.  You swipe it a few times and oops!  It's broke too!  Let's try the club.  Broke!  Equip the spear.  Broke!!!  I'm tired of hoarding swords and spears in my bag because they keep breaking.  And your SOL if they all break.  Yeah you can't fight without a weapon.  Link just looks at his empty hand like he's stupid.  Just ball up your fist and punch the goblin in the face or kick him where it counts.  Nope he just looks at his hand.  So what do you do when you break all your weapons?  You guessed it.  Run away.  Then you have to waaaaaander around blindly until you stumble on an axe or something.  Same with the bows.  They break too.And what happens during a boss fight?  SAME THING.  You dodge his attack and mash him a round then your weapon breaks and he has hardly any damage done at all.  But then you have to go to the menu and equip another weapon.  In the meantime, by the time that's done, hes coming in for a other attack.  Same sequence.  Dodge, attack, weapon breaks, replaced.  But when he hits you ONCE, its game over and you have to continue and sit through the load screen.  Not to mention the music is freaking pathetic and annoying.Weapons breaking, constantly healing after one hit, This is incredibly stupid to have to do when you are in the middle of an intense fight where you need to focus on what your doing rather than mess around swapping out weapons that keep breaking.Forget this.  Going to game stop tomorrow to trade this in.  I don't have time for this kind of garbage. I bought a Nintendo switch just for this game, because I read it was a good game.  Looks like I'm putting the switch away and hooking my PS4 back up and put back in my latest Final Fantasy game, where at least my weapons don't break, I don't die in one hit and I have some sort of sense of direction and what I'm supposed to do.Fing garbage.

I love Zelda games but to be honest it's been a long time since I been entranced by a Zelda game.  I just didn't think the latest Zelda games prior to Breath of the Wild lived up to their hype.  So I didn't think BotW would either and the videos online didn't really capture my attention either.  But it's hard to capture how fun it is in a video.Normally I lose interest pretty fast in open world games because there is just so much to do and the growing list feels daunting.  BotW's world is insanely massive, as in it makes Skyrim's world look small, but I don't find myself losing interest.  In fact I have the opposite problem.  Once I feel like I have asserted my dominance in one area I see another area off in the distance that piques my interest and in BotW you can go anywhere you can see.  No invisible walls or mountains too high.And then the game rewards you if you like to experiment.  It doesn't punish you and try to limit it eggs you on.  The potion/cooking system alone will give you useful rewards for experiments.  But it doesn't stop there.  You can change the properties of many things just by exposing them to the elements.  You may be weak to an element (heat/cold) but you can use items in various ways to overcome the environment.  You may also find yourself weaker to an element by what you're doing.  (e.g. don't wield a metal weapon during a lightning storm ...or swim)  Sloshing around in puddles will alert your presence to the enemy but sometimes bad weather and/or nighttime can help you sneak up on them.","Best Zelda game?  ...maybe, it's solid",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,36 people found this helpful

I hold nothing against the series, I was just never that into it. Based on the reviews, I was expecting the pinnacle of open world gaming on the Switch. Instead I am treated to a seemingly never-ending sequence of climbing, gliding, fighting, and cooking. Although an aesthetically beautiful game, with simple mechanics, there are some flaws that are really killing my buzz.The shrines are too far in between and far too short. I've found one repeat shrine (Small Test of Strength) and assume there are more. After the tutorial area shrines, there's no storyline requirement to hit any shrines. They are merely there for you to grind hearts and stamina. The Divine Beasts are more enjoyable dungeon experiences due to their size and complexity. I wish there were fewer, more involved shrines with better rewards.There is little variety in the monsters you'll come across, except that some groups are substantially stronger than others with no visual indication. A major source of frustration to me has been hopping one region over and being OHKO by the exact same creature that was previously hitting for a half heart per hit. This KILLS the open world feel for me because I feel as if I'm being herded through the easier regions.The weapon and shield inventory limits are ridiculous considering how quickly these items break. I have this gripe with many games, but monsters don't play by the same rules. Hit their shields as much as you like--they won't break. Tank as much damage as you want--they're still holding pristine weapons. The handful of repairable weapons in the world just don't cut it, as they can only be reforged by certain NPCs and it costs a stupid amount of resources. This is the first game I've played in close to 25 years of gaming where weapons break with this frequency and it is maddening.The world is expansive, but it's mostly open, empty space. I do like that there are little secrets sprinkled throughout a region--not concentrated around a settlement or something. But by and large you can make a bee-line from one point of interest to the next without missing anything important. In light of my above complaints, this is probably the safer way to play. And that's really the problem. If a game doesn't reward exploration, why make it massively explorable?",Overhyped,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,12 people found this helpful

In fact, after about 10-15 hours, I was pretty close to just giving up on it, but I kept playing it expecting for it to click.  It never did.  In my view, it's a OK game, but that's it.  It's not the best game on the Switch, and it's not the best game in its genre.The good:- The developers obviously put a lot of time into the game, and it shows.  There are a lot of different landscapes, the artwork is interesting, and I can only remember one bug in all the time that I played.  It is a polished, finished game.  Especially with large, open-world games, that's pretty rare, and I appreciate that.- The controls are solid, although there is some awkward button-mashing required in spots that can be frustrating.  This is particularly true for the dodge mechanic, which requires a three-button combination that, if not executed just right, will just result in a crouch that gets you clobbered by a bad guy.- It's suitable for children, which is nice.  Few of these types of games are.The not so good:- The game is awfully repetitive.  There is a really big, open, world, and that's great.  Many of the areas have different artwork and are pretty to look at.  But really, most of the territories are basically the same with different artwork layered over the top.-With a big, open world, you would expect that there would be a lot to do.  There's really not, at least as far as I can tell.  There is a main quest and there is discovering shrines.  There are a handful of side quests, but they're pretty one-dimensional and involve either discovering a shrine or running an errand for someone.  Other games like this (Fallout, Skyrim, Witcher, Horizon Zero Dawn, GTA, etc.) have some pretty involved B stories that can be just as good as the main game.-BOTW is full of some interesting ideas that are executed in a way that just makes the game too tedious and downright boring in spots.  For example:- There are something like 120 shrines to discover.  That sounds like a lot, but all the shrines fall into one of three categories:  a fight, a platformer, or a puzzle.  Every shrine is a variation of one of those three, and with 120, that gets pretty old.  In Fallout 3, a much better game, each Vault had a different story and was relatively unique.  Because of that, they were quite fun and interesting to explore.  There's nothing interesting about the shrines in BOTW once you play the first few.  Beating the shrines is important to level up your character, though, so there is a lot of repetitive grinding.- There are a lot of mountains and cliffs in the game.  It makes for interesting landscape, and you can climb them, which is a cool and different idea, but climbing is very slow, and some of the cliffs are quite big.  It's just boring to sit there for 45-60 seconds doing nothing but holding the climb button.  Worse, sometimes it rains and the cliffs become too slick to climb.  But if you need to go up the cliff to get where you're going, there is nothing to do but stand there and wait for it to stop raining.  I've actually just put down the controller and left to make myself a sandwich while I waited for it to stop raining.  What's the point of that?-Speaking of rain, the weather changes.  That's neat I guess, but they've messed it up by making it a game mechanic.  Sometimes it will storm, so if you are holding a metal weapon or a metal shield, you'll get struck by lightning and die (this also causes an inventory management problem, which I discuss below).  It rains a lot in the game but doesn't always storm, so it's easy to miss when it starts if you're not paying attention.  You'll just be wandering around and then get struck by lighting and instantly die.  That's annoying.  It also goes from extreme hot to extreme cold rather quickly.  If you don't have the proper clothing, you will die very quickly.  So for example, in the desert, the daytime is very hot and the nighttime is very cold; each require special outfits.  This might be realistic, but time passes quickly and it gets old to have to keep changing outfits every five minutes.  Again, how is this a fun game mechanic?-There is a big, open-world map, so getting from place to place can be tedious.  Other open-world games, like Fallout or Witcher, solve this problem by being able to fast travel basically anywhere.  You can fast travel in BOTW, too, but you are limited to being able to fast travel only to two types of locations:  towers and shrines.  That means that after you fast travel, you often have a lot of walking (or worse, climbing) to get to where you want to go.  That's boring.  You can also get a horse, but because so much of the map is mountainous, their utility is rather low.- Your weapons and shields deteriorate.  That's fine, plenty of other games have done that.  But in those games, there is a way to repair your equipment.  In this game, there isn't, and most of the weapons will deteriorate very quickly--just a handful of fights with monsters.  So you have this perverse incentive when you get good weapons to not use them because of a concern that they will break and then you won't have them later for the boss battles or occasional more powerful monster that you run across.-  By itself, the deterioration issue probably wouldn't be terrible.  When it is combined with a limited inventory and specialized weapons, it becomes downright awful.  You only have a few weapons slots, but you have to horde weapons because you never know when they might break.  Worse, some monsters a particularly vulnerable to a single type of weapon--ice sword, fire sword, etc.  So you always want to make sure you have one of each of those.  And, when it storms, you can't use a metal weapon, so you have to keep a wooden weapon, too.  You wind up always fretting about what weapons to keep and which to drop, and when.  It's frustrating to drop a weapon that you need later because you didn't have room for it at the time.  It's just unnecessary.-To recover health, you have to cook meals in a pot.  That's fine, but it takes a lot of time and clicks to gather items out of your inventory and then a few more seconds for them to actually cook.  It doesn't sound like much, but if you want to prepare 10-15 meals to prepare for a boss battle (or because you don't have the proper equipment and need the temporary boost that a meal provides), it's really tiresome to sit at the fire and do stuff over and over again.- There are really only a handful of different monsters you fight.  The monsters that you meet in the first few minutes of the game will be seen through the rest of the game, except more powerful.  When you go to a new area, it's basically the same monsters, except there is an ""ice"" version, a ""fire"" version, or a ""skeleton"" version.In sum, the bones are here for a good game, but it's just not a good game.  I can tell they put a lot of work into the game, and for that I am appreciative.  But gosh, shouldn't the game be fun?  Three stars is as high as I can go, and that might even be a bit generous.If you like the open world game, you've probably already played many of the games that are far and away better than BOTW.  Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, GTA and Witcher (available on Switch) are clearly better.  If you are looking for an open world game that is suitable for a child, Lego City Undercover (available on Switch) is better than BOTW, and usually half the price.  If you also have a PS4, Horizon Zero Dawn is a game that has the same motif as BOTW, but is much, much better in nearly every way.","Maybe I am missing something, but I don't get the love for this game.",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

I have played some of the old Zelda games and didn't really enjoy them too much. I don't generally like action RPGs. This game, though? I love this game. There are often many different ways to tackle any problem and your only limitation is your imagination. It took some time to get used to the controls (might take less time for someone who is more used to fighting games), but they make sense once you do. The worst part of the game is that it uses the button function of the joysticks, so if you apply too much pressure (as you might during an intense fight), you will either crouch or go into scope mode. Obviously, these are both very bad things when you're trying to maneuver around an enemy. Some people complain there are too many shrines. I don't think so. I love the shrines. Each one is a puzzle and though some elements are repeated, I do not feel they are repetitive as each requires you to think about how to use those elements in a new way. I've also seen people complain about the korok seeds, but I don't see how that's a problem? It's a fun little bonus to find and it only helps you by expanding your inventory. If you don't want to go around looking for them, don't. Trust me, you will stumble across plenty as you're exploring.","A true masterpiece.

This game has restored my hope for a fun gaming future with my kids. It can be played slowly and methodically or straight to the story line objectives, there’s no wrong way. It has a good slow burn and I imagine will be enjoying many hours with it. My child has blasted through main quests and is now enjoying expansion packs and side quests. We’ve had it for about 10 months. There are arrows flying and fighting monster creatures with crazy mythical powered swords and hammers but you are rarely taking aim at something that has human likeness (except those darn Yiga) and there’s no gore involved. In Zelda BOTW if you hunt a deer it falls into a nice little pile of raw prime meat, you pick it up, make a fire, and cook it with some herbs you found in the forest.  If you want more realism go play rdr2 after the kids are in bed. I’m sure it would have you up to your elbows in fake deer blood butchering the thing for a realistic 5 hours.

I know that's an unpopular opinion but honestly anytime you review a mainline Nintendo game as anything less than the Second Coming you're going to get downvoted.Legend of Zelda: Assassin's Creed. So much of Breath of the Wild is cribbed from other open world games. You climb towers to reveal the map. Areas of the map are off-limits until you pass certain story or equipment requirements. If you just add in the ""hay dive"" the core mechanics would look a whole lot like other games.Legend of Strategy Guides. An early quest says climb a tower and identify several places to go next. I do so. I head out toward those points and... I die. I jumped off the no-go zone because I assumed this was the game telling me where to go. So I climb the tower again and look for the ""correct"" places to go, which are literally the same type of places as I scouted before. I was just looking at the ""wrong"" ones... even though they're literally identical so in the early game I have absolutely no way to tell the difference. I have to open my map AFTER I mark a point, verify that it's one of the ""right"" ones, then head off toward the ""correct"" next destination. I die again. It turns out most of these early-game points require cold weather clothing. Climate hasn't been thoroughly explained yet in the game. There are no shops. You can't eat regular food items to restore health when you're cold. So umm... what do I do? I'm barely an hour in, and I have to look up a guide for where the cold-weather clothing is. That's bad. Cold-weather clothing seems to only be available in one cabin, which has nothing to stand out on the map, behind a quest that has next to zero explanation on how to complete it. Not good.Legend of Teleporting Old Men. Nintendo wanted a deserted feel to this part of the world, but they couldn't figure out how to explain mechanics to the player without their usual NPCs. So there's one teleporting old man to stand in for the array of shopkeeps and tutorials a game would normally have. I see through you, Nintendo. When you add up all the places where the old man appears to help you, there are dozens of people living and working in the first area of the game. It isn't really deserted. The people are just hidden behind an invisible wall that makes them all look like the same old man. I don't like that design choice, even if I understand why it was done.Legend of Deserted World Maps. A lot of Breath of the Wild is open space. I totally understand that you're supposed to be drinking in the scenery, the music, the ambiance. But I just got screwed up because the game places several copies of objective markets right in front of you and punished you if you go to the ""wrong"" ones. So now I have several cases where I regret all the backtracking and wasted time I've spent trying to track down the next objective - and I'm still in what amounts to the tutorial. That's not a good sign.I get where Breath of the Wild is going. I appreciate Nintendo tried something ""new"" for a Zelda game. But slapping a Zelda label on a new Assassin's Creed game is not nearly as interesting or groundbreaking as people want to think it is. It's a clever ploy, it sucked in a lot of people, but it doesn't work on me.There are other little things poking at me already. Weapons break too fast, and there's a limited inventory, so early game I feel like I'm throwing a kitchen sink at every enemy. The moment I got unlimited bombs, I quit using my regular weapons entirely whenever I could. It would have been a much better choice, in my opinion, to have a longer life on these weapons so that you're not wasting time and energy managing them early game. You're supposed to be exploring and enjoying the world, not moping because a stick broke. I think they patched some of the late-game problems here, where even very rare weapons broke too quickly so you kept throwing garbage at enemies to preserve your good weapons, but it's still a silly problem to have. I'd prefer the opposite - what if your beginning stick levels up, so you always want to keep it by your side? It could be your companion in the Wild. I think that makes a lot more sense, and then you'd really have to agonize about inventory space.So this game doesn't click for me. I'll play it, just like I play any Assassin's Creed game once in a while.

Nintendo basically said, ""Let Sony and Microsoft go at it with the big graphic games, we're going to do something different.""  I was a bit skeptical, but they seemed to own the cartoonish look of their games, and just made games that were fun and engaging and I was impressed.  I've tried sticking with Nintendo since, but I'm starting to find that they're being outpaced in such a big way now.  Playing any open world game on another console and you have big, expansive worlds; graphics that are great; in-depth environments; and fun game-play.For example, I recently finished Assassin's Creed Origins and am now playing Far Cry 5.  Not only are the environments that Ubisoft makes just plain beautiful, they're fun.  I've only played a few hours of Far Cry so far, but I've ridden a ATV through a forest, taken a speedboat down a river, ridden in a helicopter, explored several unique buildings, come across several surprises in the forest, and had some fun gun battles.In contrast, BOTW I've played for several hours.  What have I done?  I've gotten some melee weapons and had some ho-hum battles swinging at enemies.  I've spent a large part of my gaming time in the menus equipping weapons that (for some strange reason) constantly break and need to be collected and re-equipped.  I've explored some comparatively unremarkable environments, and cooked some items I gathered.  And I've died a lot because of the crazy fatigue system built into the game.  Fall off a cliff near water or swim just a little too far and you die.  Oh, and don't let it rain in the game if you want to climb.  Rain makes you slip, and if you're in an area where you need to climb, you're basically just stuck until the rain stops.  A lot of the game-play seems clunky.  Riding on a horse, battling on a horse, or even having a battle just seem un-intuitive.I'll try with almost any game, but I fell like I've given this one a fair try and it's just not grabbing my attention.  I feel like I'm just wandering around aimlessly and when I find a challenge it's kind of a grind more than a thrill ride.If I had to say some positives, I'd say that it's nostalgic feeling, if you like puzzle games the shrines offer some nice mini-games, and obviously if you're traveling then you can play an open world game to pass the time.Still, if I compare this game to games like Witcher, Skyrim, or any big open world game it feels almost childish in a way, and maybe that's what I don't like about it.

I warned you... it will suck you in and keep you there...glued to the screen until your controllers run out of battery life! PRO tip for those first using the controllers:  if you have not fully-charged the controllers, you might get an hour or two out of the game, but that's it!I don't know who designed this, and I vaguely remember playing it on the Wii years ago, but not THIS. It's a complete environmental immersion into the fantasy world of Hyrule! The back story is pretty old, but it applies so well in this version. The graphics are outstanding! Gameplay is smooth, even though everything is wireless.What I love most about the game is that you can know absolutely nothing, and the game is built to take you on the journey. If you're an advanced player, you can zip through things easily and still find challenges. I haven't yet played through everything, and there are little hidden goodies all over the maps, new things to discover...on and on and on. YES, even cheating via YouTube videos only helps you so much. You still have to perform the tasks! The Japanese-sourced characters, story, and references are very Wii-oriented, and putting nature above all else feels authentic.For those afraid of heights... well... there are moments when you either have to get over it, or you won't be able to perform certain tasks! So cheat, or not, read up or not, or just let the game take you for a very, very, very long ride through gorgeously-rendered landscapes that interact with you! Discover endless puzzles, adventures, and minor social-interactions with a huge cast of characters.The game is forgiving. If you die... you'll be able to continue from a last saved position. Feel that you might lose in a situation? Save first, go back later! Voila! Compared to some of the other much-more-complicated titles out there, this game is completely forgiving!I'm new to the Switch, so perhaps I'm just overwhelmed, but this game blew away my expectations and got me absolutely hooked!NOTE: Legend of Zelda has always been a single-player game. It's designed around a single person playing a single character. There are some multiplayer options - I have not yet explored them. But this isn't a game you sit and play with a partner.

There are not enough words to describe Breath of the Wild but I will try lol. First thing you notice it the new graphics for the Zelda Franchise. It looks like your playing your way through a painting which is truly a work of art. You are literally thrown out there to play with a storyline starting right from the get go. Your first quest is to kill Ganon. You can go straight to him and give that shot. Good luck to ya. Not gonna happen. Now if you play the game right and follow your waypoint on the map for the fisrt while you will learn exactly what you need to learn to get you through the rest of the game. Before you know it you will have quests stacked up in your que like you were playing World of Warcraft. Its not online but it sure seems like the World is big enough to be an MMORPG. It does feel lonely out there sometimes without some friends playing beside you. The quests are excellent in Breath of the Wild. You can Choose whatever you want to do anytime you want to do it. I hear complaints that people felt they were doing the same thing over and over again. Well thats how they were playing. They were going around finishing the Shrines which are little dungeons which you solve puzzles in. Its very important to knock these shrines off but you can break away and just do quests if you like. Or you can collect items for cooking or go looking to catch a horse so you dont have to hoof it everywhere in this huge world. I never felt the world was empty as every way I have gone there was always something to do. You come up on these little camps, which if cleared will result in opening a chest. Battles at first seemed very hard but once I got the hang of it I started clearing camps in no time. To me the game is the perfect open world action RPG. I highly recommend Breath of the Wild to any RPG fan out there. If you play like I do and do all the side quests and try to find all its secrets with p,aying along the storyline you can expect to play at least 100 hours.

I primarily am a PC Gamer but work and travel often. I own both a Switch Lite that I take with me and a normal V2 Switch that I leave mostly in the dock. Both are pictured. Since this game was on sale I wanted to also get it for my Switch. I installed it on both my Switch Lite and V2 Switch. I have around 4000 US dollars in my gaming PC. Basically the best you can get and I play Switch just as much. This is imo the best console out and that’s ever been made. It’s so easy to pick up play and incredibly fun. Nintendo still makes some of the best first party games out there. You can enjoy it at home traditionally or literally anywhere else you want. I ordered this game Zelda: BotW and Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate together. They both came within 3 days in perfect sealed condition brand new.

They all looked the same to me and all but one of them were pretty easily beaten once you had gotten far enough into the game. One of them, was kind of tough...but I have no doubts in a replay, I could easily take him down as well.Also the final boss was WAY too easy to beat. I couldn't believe it when I finally faced Gannon just how easily he was conquered. I expected more out of the end fight than that...this is after all, The Legend of Zelda. I found some of the over world bosses much more difficult to beat...and I'm talking about the Lynels here.

It is nothing like Zelda Ocarina that was a group of small mini games all sewn together in a fairly great fable. At first I was very hesitant to buy this game because a serious gamer said he beat it in 30 hours and we had a few years of fun playing Zelda Ocarina of Time all it's side games and mini games while using it to teach the children to read instructions. They became great fans of Zelda and when they got older asked for a Wii they specifically asked for the game and bow set up for I guess the name was Link for their birthdays as they both are born in March.  I have not played this Link line of games since Nintendo 64 and as I play through it not using walk throughs as I was told it is a short game I am learning this young man must have skipped all the side actitivies, competitions and looking for all the game gifts just fought his way through the game.I think if the information that comes with the new game helps play the game it would have been worth purchasing a new game or at least a book to help me find things. I do not know if there is a map to discover in the game like in Ocarina but I am very lost and tracking backwards without a good map in this game. I hope it turns up somewhere or I can buy it as I just bought salt for the recipes. The recipes are fun it would be nice if I could keep a list of what was done so I can make the better ones again as I discover them in game play. I find the mountains very difficult to climb without the speed and stamina elixers.It is growing on my slowly.This is not a child's game like Zelda Ocarina of time with brighter colors that would probably be excellent updated for the Switch for younger children...but  it is an adventure game. At first because it is a big jump from the 64 game I did not like it but as time went on it began to grow on me I am beginning to like it but I sure would like a map I am so lost even driving without a physical recent map.Do you want a nice review or do you want the truthThe graphics apparently are very good on Zelda Breath of time for the Switch.But like with Skylanders Imaginators which runs on Toys to Life which I began playing because my nephew plays it on my Switch gifted to me for Christmas.I found the new Switch Zelda game to be very difficult loaded constantly with Boss monsters and difficult puzzles.These is only normal run and Pro run games so it is apparently designed for the hard core gamer unlike the Zelda Ocarina of time I bought used for near new price many years after it as designed for the Nintendo 64 because it was more a younger persons puzzle and adventure game loaded with mini games and not as much violence.This is a Hard core games game apparently someone who just finds a way to fight to the end then resells or soon after purchasing it like I bought it used missing all the pamphlets and information and then it was tried to be foisted off on me as a new game.If it had been new I would have returned it because I am a beginnger level player always will be even though I have playe 20 years.I use walk throughs and information to help me play most games.But as this is a constant fight fight fight M for Mature Violent game now if you are a hard core gamer you can rent the game fight through ignore all the side quests, not enjoy the horses which are very untameable and do not follow good directions so much I often found myself walking and whistling for the away horse.If you like near impossible puzzles and fighting very few clues in a game that does not like to let you go back where you have been and just want to fight through a game this is the game for you.But rent it and play it on the Switch handheld counsel as it looks very washed out on the tv.Designed for the Switch and for the Hardcore gamersNot a child's game.But if you are a hard core gamer I suggest you get the Ammibos to up the gameplay a bit which they do not tell you can be used in the game and run it on professional level before you try to resell it.Also the harder part of the game than the monsters are some of the many Shrine puzzles one which runs like a marble roll game there is a trick I am working out on how to solve it.If it was for a child or a novice player and less about fighting and adventure I am sure it would be kept by the right people driving up the pice like Animal Crossing has.If you want a review that you do not pay fordon't punish the honest person for saying I don't like itBut the hard core gamers love it.So I knew when someone told me they beat it in 30 hours it as probably just a bang bang fight fight hit hit hard core gamers game.I rate it M for Mature and Lots of Game violence as the bully monsters constnatly beat up travelers whom you can save to come back and find them stuck eternally in the same scenario with the same monsters for the same small monster organ rewards for killing them and saving the victims.I found most the recipets to be near worthless against Boss Monsters which this game is loaded with.I give it a big thumbs up for young hard core fight gamers but for novice and children along with parents I suggest you find a game that is less violent as apparently children are shooting us after playing this lot of very violent games out now.If you are a hardcore gamer like the Game store employees are rent the game don't open the package and try to sell it off to me as new after you have used it or here. And remember some of us who are not serious gamers need the pamphlets and all the help we can get because our minds are different than yours we like to stop eat the apple, cook the meals, see the worlds all over Built by Nintendo and buy the Amiibos.I did not want to buy the game at the game store as I knew as hard as the employee tried to sell it to me ""new"" at a reduced price he had played it while off work and then brought it back repackaged it. Don't sell me a game think I don't know it is not new and do not change the name to new condition and then charge me illegally to my credit card for a used game especially when I know it is missing every single pamphlet that it comes with that gives information like you can use an Amiibo in the game.This game after all these years seems to still be a single player game which having the option for 2 to 4 player adventuring and fighting the huge monsters online or at home would surely be more entertaining.If I had paid full price I would be disappointed and stuck with a Used game. Rent these games first before buying if you can find a place to rent them. But so far I have put the Switch down sometimes for months like the Xbox One which has not been used in over a year as the PS3 controllers can be run wired not run out of battery power, run on the tv and the cherished but not mass produced PS vita system which still runs high used because of limited production and high popularity for the number produced.As I understand it is a loved Gamer hard core game I gave it a 5 starbut for me I give it as sit in the corner now for awhile if the horses are not able to be tamed and are programmed to run away from any sigh of trouble or into a big fight to kill you no in between the horses are crazy. So just walk through.If all you want to do is run to the end not enjoy the fabulous perk hard to tame and catch seriously wild horses that develop personality issues such after encountering Ogres and other monsters rent the game don't try to resell it to me as new as I buy new games also but as these sold out it has been difficult locally to find it not being resold as a new game when it is used also.",..,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

That is more of my own personal learning curve then anything against the game. The story is engaging and makes you want to keep working to uncover more of it. I never felt like something was repetitive and each shrine challenge felt like I was getting something out of it and growing my character.  Overall I’ve been blown away.

But that is a good thing, since I rarely ever died in other Zeldas.  In this one, you will probably die a lot, especially in the earlier stages before you get around to doing armor upgrades.  As the game progresses, you will die less, but it is still more challenging than any Zelda before or since.If there was 1 thing I wish they focused on more, it would probably be the storyline.  While the cutscenes are good, they are quite few and far between.  After you finish the Divine beasts, you will probably want to finish the shrines and upgrade armor before fighting Ganon.

With the open world map. Awesome graphics. A good story line. Overall, anyone can pick up this game and play it as a stand alone without having played any of the other  Zelda games.While the story line progressed a little faster than your level could keep up (not exactly a leveling system but measured by how many hearts and amount of stamina you have) it was fairly streamlined. You just have to do a bit of grinding to find shrines and obtain orbs to get additional hearts or stamina in between each story piece. You also had to have 4 orbs to to trade for 1 heart or a quarter of stamina.As an RPG one thing I enjoyed was hunting down and finding the different clothing and armor items for Link to wear. With the addition of changing the coloring, I was able to find a look for Link that I liked, making him somewhat unique to me.The major downside to the game was the weapons. Every weapon had a limited number of uses to them. You could find a great sword or bow or spear that had great power. Unfortunately, after a few uses, *poof* it was gone! This left you scrambling to find as many weapons as you could. However, unless you collected enough Korok Seeds to trade to a creature and get more storage space, you would be very limited in the number of weapons and shields you could carry. Best strategy to combat this - download a map of all shrine and Korok Seed locations. You can place stamps all over the map of item locations. As you are working on clearing through an area or moving on to the next story point, mark the map of where the shrines and Korok Seeds are located and gather those as you go. This way you can trade these as you go along and quickly increase your hearts, stamina, and weapons cache, giving you a bit of an edge.Overall, it was a great game! With better weapon mechanics, I would have given this game a 5 Star review. I finally finished the story last week and I bought it in January (I don't get to play as much as I would like).",Great Game For Kids and Adults,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,

The less-is-more approach does not apply to the map, which is HUGE and the scenery is amazing. The dungeons do not follow the tried and true Zelda formula; solve puzzles in a dungeon, find a piece of gear that will help you, defeat the boss with the item, repeat. This is not a bad thing, there are no special items used to defeat bosses and the dungeons can be beaten in any order you want, you could even fight the end boss right away if you wanted, if you could get to him. There is a bit of nostalgia that Zelda fans will recognize, but the game doesn't get carried away with it nor does it distract from the game itself. The open world concept is nice albeit a bit overwhelming at first.Pros:- Big, beautiful map with a lot of nice scenery- A lot to do, many side quests mixed in with the main story- Holds on to what makes Zelda Zelda. Nintendo succeeds with some new concepts but doesn't completely deviate from the tried and true series modelHowever, there are cons:- RPG style, not necessarily a con, but you could get so powerful to the point the end boss will be incredibly underwhelming- The sword combat mechanics are clunky, so much so it feels like sword fighting was designed to be a secondary combat method, which is not the Legend of ZeldaThe cons are minor and shouldn't stop you from getting the game if you're thinking about it, I am a Zelda fanatic and I really like how this game fits into the Legend of Zelda series, still not my favorite (Link to the Past, Twilight Princess), but any Zelda fan will really enjoy this game.By the way, your gear will break, no way around it, get used to it.",Just the right mixture of new and old.,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

The open-world nature lends greatly to hours upon hours of restless exploration. I personally am infatuated with exploration games, and I feel as though Breath of The Wild does an incredible job at giving the player a vast world to explore.2) Equipment durability is a pain in the butt! But it adds a layer of depth to the experience, requiring you to get tactical. Save your strongest weapons for the strongest enemies. A variety of weapons will save you. Varying materials will also save you. Few situations suck more than being stuck in a lightning storm with only metal shields, bows, and melee weapons. If you have no wooden equipment, prepare to have a bad day.3) Many conventional Zelda tropes are dropped, such as doing things in a specific order. This is similar to how A Link Between Worlds allowed you to tackle challenges in any order you desired.Those are the three most important points of this game, I think. An open world in which many previous tropes are cast aside and new mechanics give new challenges to a series that has been largely the same from iteration to iteration. That's it in one sentence.The short and skinny is this: If you are a fan of The Legend of Zelda, I think you owe it to yourself to play this game. Even if you find that it's not for you, you can at least say you gave it a fair chance.","If you are a fan of The Legend of Zelda, I think you owe it to yourself to play this game.",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,

As in nearly all of them, including any remakes and spin-offs. And while Breath of the Wild was groundbreaking in a lot of ways, I feel like it could have done better in certain aspects.Things I liked:The Open World - I absolutely loved the idea that you could run straight to Ganon if you so desired (and promptly get destroyed, but who cares?). And the fact that the world was so MASSIVE made it even more fun - there was always something undiscovered, something new with each and every playthrough. And the effects of the different areas, such as death by cold or heat, or weather conditions such as lightning, were awesome.The Monsters - the monsters were both challenging AND entertaining. I loved fighting them, and they were difficult enough that I've probably died more in this game than in any other Zelda game. I also really liked how they would react with certain weapons and situations, such as yelling at you in outrage if you stole their weapons, or would look around their surroundings for another item to throw at you (Moblins throwing other monsters, for example)The Clothes - I liked the styles for each individual outfit, and the benefits one could get if they fully upgraded them. However, in the end, I settled on making Link run around in nothing but his boxers for both the challenge and for the hilarity of it, but the fact that it's POSSIBLE makes it even better. Also the cross-dressing.Side-Quests - The sheer number of them was great, and some of the side missions (Pond of Love, anyone?) were hilarious and new.Cooking - the fact that you could forage, and create items that would heal you, or give you stealth boosts, or enhance your endurance, was new and a good addition to the game. No more having to rely on just four bottles! If you get hit and you're dying, you can eat fifty apples to get back on track (and you WILL get several hundred apples over the course of the game).Weapons - This is a love-hate relationship. I loved all the different weapons that you could get in the game, but I hated how QUICKLY they broke. Some of them were really cool/funny (The Castle Guard Series, the mops/brooms, the Lynel Weapons), but the fact that they broke so swiftly made getting them kind of pointless at times. And the fact that the Master Sword broke too was annoying, even if it recharged after a couple of minutes.The Divine Beasts - These are so COOL. I love the whole steampunk look, but also the fact that each divine beast has different functions and challenges made it more fun. And there were multiple ways to defeat the Blights, so what might work for some people wouldn't work for others.The Music - so simple and so soothing. The music itself is amazing, and perfectly sets the mood for the game. I especially liked the music for the Rito Village (and Revali's theme), Tarrey Town, and the Ganon battles. It's an excellent soundtrack, and it's not the first time I've wished that Zelda also released official albums for their games.Lack of a Companion - one thing that always irritated me about previous Zelda games was the annoying companion that followed you around (Midna being the only exception from Twilight Princess). But in this game, there's none of that, which is really nice.Master Mode - SO HARD. It forces you to be creative in some of your fights, and it made me angry enough to rage quit on the Master Sword DLC, which I've never done before. Basically, it's very challenging.Things I didn't like:The Shrines - There are 120 of them, and some of them are trial by combat, some of them are puzzles, and some of them are memory-based with no hope of remembrance (Dueling Peaks, I'm looking at you). They were fun at first, but after a while, they got exhausting. But unfortunately, they're necessary if you want more hearts and stamina. The only shrine I really, absolutely liked, was the one on Eventide Island, because Survival Man is my jam. Honestly, I wish they had a couple of traditional Zelda dungeons thrown in with the shrines - it would have made the game much better in my opinion.The Weapons - as mentioned aboveThe Korok Seeds - there are over 800 of these mofos scattered around the map. EIGHT HUNDRED. And there's a limit as to how much you can expand your weapon/shield/bow stash, even if you DO find all 800 of them, which makes a good majority of the Korok seeds useless. If there were like 200 of these to find, I probably wouldn't have been so aggravated trying to find them all, but no, there's over 800 and there's no point for most of them.The Story - one thing I've greatly enjoyed about the Zelda series is the story. And while BOTW does offer one, it's a little...lacking. The only thing I really enjoyed about it was the development of Zelda's character, which was the only substantial part of the story. There's too many things to do, and not enough story to support it. Just quick little flashbacks that almost feel like afterthoughts. I don't mind the whole memory loss thing, I just wish there was more to the plot of the game.The Voice Acting - Don't get me wrong, I love how they even HAD voice acting in the first place. I just wish they picked BETTER voice actors. The only ones I liked were Urbosa, Mipha, and Revali. The others...not so much.Calamity Ganon - they build him up as the big bad, the one you MUST defeat, the hardest villain of all...and then it's a disappointment. The only time it got difficult for me was when it teleported me into the field with my horse, and I happened to have Ganon's giganto horse with me at the time, which unfortunately can't sprint.Overall, I really liked the game - while some parts were lacking, it was very different compared to other, more traditional Zelda games. It's very easy to get sucked into it and to lose months of your life to it. And I would recommend the DLCs. They're not super expensive, and they add more challenge and bonuses to the game, as well as more story (and what feels like an actual Zelda dungeon and boss fight!).

I've never played a LOZ game ever and had no expectations before jumping in. Here are my personal opinions about the game and my thoughts in my initial playthrough:TL;DR: Good game, recommend especially when discounted.Pros:1) Pretty big open world. Lots to explore.2) Not much handholding. (Just enough to get the basics in) A lot of situations in this game have multiple solutions so it encourages trial & error/outside of the box thinking.3) Kid-friendly but also enjoyable for adults/parents4) Neat details/mechanics that makes the world more alive (ex: weather, npc day & night cycles)Meh:1) No bulk cooking/potion making option. It's fun to experiment but after a while, it gets tedious when you're trying to make multiple items.2) Weapon durability. The majority of wieldable weapons have a set amount of usage until it breaks. This isn't too much of a problem since more can be found via exploration.3) The story. Please note that I haven't finished the game yet but the story is nothing to write home about. The voice acting quality is nice but the substance of the actual story is just okay. It's not groundbreaking but at least it makes sense.Cons:1) The price. This game is ~5 years old and it's still almost costing the same as when it first launched.

I can honestly say I enjoyed this game, played it every day to completion and was invested enough to get the best ending completely by accident on the first playthrough, but the story, ultimately, is a little weak and relies heavily on tropes and bad character archetypes; you will hate the voice acting, but love the character design.

There are PLENTY of weapons throughout the game where you really don't feel defenseless. You can also expand your inventory to hold even more weapons.3. The game is too easy: Have you explored EVERYTHING? Sure, just blazing through the story isn't too difficult, but there is so much to do, and none of it seems repetitive. In addition, hard mode DLC is coming out.4. Frame rate drops: Is this really an issue that detracts from the gameplay? It very seldom slows down.5. The rain is inconvenient: See answer to #1.6. The graphics don't compare to PS4 or Xbone: Graphics aren't everything, but also the style is more artistic than realistic. You feel like you're immersed in a Miyazaki film.7.

This review contains content spoilers in reference to what you can expect when you play the game, but doesn't contain any story or plot spoilers.For the first five days I had this game, I logged over 48 hours.  I lived, dreamed (literally), and thunk breath of the wild and I could not get enough.Then, after about getting half way through the main quest (there are minor side quests), I found myself seriously struggling to proceed further in the game.Let me break it down:1. The good.This game has outstanding graphics by comparison of other Zelda games.  The open world environment is a fantastic experience that gives you universal freedom to do whatever you want, the entire scope of Hyrule is open to you immediately.  Each corner of the map is an entirely different environment that is also athletically unique.  The jungles have immense amounts of waterfalls to explore, Death Mountain has rocks you can mine, the desert has hills that stretch for miles, and Hyrule field is a largely open area where the possibilities are endless.The greatest new feature of this game is Links ability to climb basically anything that is in his/your way.  You could spend an entire day just doing this, see a mountain in the distance?  All you have to do is get to the base and have at it, (it's a little more technical than this) and this aspect opens up Hyrule in a way never seen before.  The game also contains various side quests which give the title a bit more depth than in the past where it is A) Find Zelda. B) Get Master Sword. C) Restore power to Master Sword. D) Kill Ganon/ Ganondorf2. The bad.Like I said earlier, this game gets old, fast.  This is because the things that you have to do in the game to truly advance your character (gain heart containers and the new stamina vessels), are extremely repetitive.  The new Shrine system tasks Link with completing small puzzles of different natures all over the map (these locations also serve as fast travel points) and each shrine takes between 5-20 minutes on average.  You gain ""Spirit Orbs"" which you then exchange for Heart Containers or Stamina Vessels.  This is very different than traditionally, as you either collected ""Pieces of Hearts"" or gained Heart Containers through boss battles.  There are 120 shrines in total, and after about 50, you find yourself having to force yourself to complete them.Another new aspect is the multiple sets of armor, shields, bows, and melee weapons Link can use; BUT most importantly: Weapon Durability.  This is a pivotal complaint among those who have critiqued this game from a slightly negative aspect, as a weapons durability (while variable) really only seem to last for about 3-4 monster encounters.  You constantly find yourself weighing if its worth wasting a very rare weapon you find on weaker level enemies, because you know in your mind it WILL break, and succumb to using multiple weaker-weapons you find very early in the game saving that one special sword or shield for the few large scale monster encounters you do have.Likewise, the armor you find has stat boosting abilities (increased sneak, increased climbing speed, or heat resistance) and you find yourself changing armor on the fly multiple times every couple of minutes depending on what it is that you are doing.  While not as bad as the issue of weapon durability, it invariably becomes a chore.3. The ugly.This games ultimate downfall is the elimination of what made the classical Zelda games, Zelda games.  From turning the recovery of the Master Swords into an option (be it that the game highly recommends it), to the fact that you don't have the ability to use Links stereotypical green armor until you complete an achievement that spans the entire game, it felt like while they kept Link in name, they stripped him of everything that made him who we recognize.To further build on this, the game has eliminated another core element of what made The Legend of Zelda, well, The Legend of Zelda: Dungeons.  IIm not kidding, BOW does not contain a single dungeon other than the very, very last steps of the game. Instead, there is the Shrine system (not attached to any sort of quest, but is essential if you want more than three hearts), as well as a few ""large puzzles"" that take you through the main quest.  I'll leave it to reader interpretation as to what that means for boss battles. . .With the removal of dungeons, Link also looses his access to the tools that he would gain throughout the series in previous titles.  The hook-shot, iron boots, ball & chain ect. are non-existent.  While the replacement system of the Runes is a decent attempt by Nintendo to reconcile this, it felt cheap and frankly?  They're boring to use, and almost useless in combat.To finally end what now feels like a nostalgic rant, the variety of monsters in BOW is the smallest variation you could hope for.  Honestly, there are about four different types of ""grunt level"" monsters you encounter throughout the entire game, three larger sub-variants of these same smaller monsters, and two beasts that actually pose a series threat to you throughout the game.  BOW instead utilizes a color system to differentiate the difficulty they present (Red, Blue, Black, and sometimes Silver) , and instead of having a large scope of monsters throughout the game- you encounter the same monsters from the start of the game, through the very end.I really hate to be the debby downer.  Especially when it comes to the foundational game that developed my love for video games, but this game didn't feel like a true Zelda title.  It felt like it wanted to take the successful plot line which has kept me a fan for years and apply that to a different games world.  If I had to deal with only ""the bad"" I think I could at least give this game four stars, the only reason I can give it three is because those first five hours were exhilarating.  Intrigued at best, let down and disappointed at worst.","An outstanding game, but not true to the classical Zelda game series.",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,25 people found this helpful

Even boss battle music doesn't stick out. Weapon durability is also a pain, as every weapon breaks insanely quickly.

Weapon durability is dumb, make a crafting bench to repair items you like, so you don't have to get rid of weapons you do like, and get stuck with terrible weapons. I couldn't tell you how many bows I lost to the three hirnox's. I wish I could have kept the good ones, or at least repaired them to slightly worse condition.

Nothing about this game at all feels or plays like a Zelda game of the past. That's fine and all but I feel so removed that I completely lose all interest in everything in this game as there is little to no memorable characters or moments in the game. I feel like I have been wasting my time. I have limited time as it is to play games so when a game asks me to commit so much time get any value from it I feel like I've been had and wasted my money.

There's no doubt this game deserves a 5 star score. It's bold and Nintendo created a world that's bigger than any game to date. I want to point out that I did beat the game and completed most of the dungeons that are spread out throughout the game. I'm sure by now you've heard all the good and great things about the game, but there should be the negative as well.  First, I did not like how Nintendo undermined the weapon system. Weapons and shields break too often. How does this effect the game? You're travelling the vast land, yet you feel reluctant to fight the moblins and goblins because you don't know if it will be worth it for your item to break. Even ""unbreakable"" items can wear out and need time to recharge.  Second, if Nintendo wanted to make the travelling worth while combat and fighting should reward you. Sure there are items and chests to gain if you take over a moblin base, but the items are often not worth it. I would see someone trying to make the case that you need to battle enemies to gain their parts to upgrade armor, but once you upgrade, fighting becomes pointless. There's no experience gained or leveling up, so why not just run away most of the time. I have played Horizon Zero Dawn and in my opinion, HZD's battles felt more Zelda-like than Botw. The weapons and items in HZD seemed to have more value than BOTW. Enemies take more strategy to beat in HZD and every weapon had a purpose to defeating an enemy with a weakness to it. I'm not saying HZD is a better game or BOTW is a better game mind you. I'm not trolling Zelda, I gave it a 5 star score. For those who played both games, you will see what I am talking about with the enjoyment of battles in HZD.  Third, bosses have been simplified. You do not need a special item or much strategy to beat the bosses. In past Zelda's the dungeon's secret item would be the weakness to the boss. But in BOTW all you need is a strong weapon and armor to beat bosses. The bosses were not overly creative. Each boss was only marginally different from the previous.  Where are the iconic items? Where is the boomerang, the hookshot,, heavy boots, bug net, fairy bottles, etc, etc. Items were a central theme in all the Zeldas. Why did they take that out? It was one of the biggest surprises or exciting parts of previous games when opening a chest. Putting value into items is something I would like to see reinstated in future games.  Fourth, the epic field music is gone and replaced by a subtle piano and atmospheric tunes. In all of the previous Zeldas, I would be either humming or whistling tunes from Zelda for days after I had finished. Yes, the game does have one theme that reoccurs when something important happens or when you beat a boss, or when you find a stable, but not a very memorable soundtrack.  Fifth, many of the side quests do not have much bearing on the actual main story. Sure, some side quests in the game will help you gain helpful items and armor, but it does not change the ending or how NPC will react to you. Since Nintendo wanted to take a page from the western rpg genre, decision making should have been impactful to the outcome of the game. POTENTIAL SPOILER--->From what I know there are two endings to the game and I have gotten both by visiting all the specific areas in the game that's part of a side quest.  Sixth, does bigger mean better? In the case that there are 120 mini dungeons in the game, they had to make the world bigger to fit them, but in my opinion, making the world so large made things a little tedious. Sure, there is fast travel, but getting to each location seemed a little bit of a chore especially since fighting enemies was not rewarding, and other than finding mini dungeons and moblin bases, there was nothing much to do. I don't consider hunting or gathering foods that much of reason for the large map.  In no way am I bashing Zelda. In fact, I do believe it deserves to be the game of the year. Even with what I consider as flaws, the good outweigh the negative greatly. I just hope Nintendo can take some advice from their fans to improve the next installment.","Terrific game, but not perfect in my opinion (from a Zelda veteran)",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

Game play is completely different from the classics we all know and love, game play feels more like Elderscrolls. The main quests have no definitive order. You pretty much go and do as you please.

Though I must say it may have too much open space because with this huge vast open world game it tends to feel almost too big with enemies being sometimes way to far apart of way to close together, unless you get a horse you will find yourself running around all over the place to the point they might have just implemented a Pokémon go thing in there (I'm sorry about that).Combat can be a little dull at the beginning since advanced combat training isn't taught until later in the game (because now these days games just don't come with manuals anymore like the old days)I must say though weapon breaking which is highly in this game tends to be annoying and you'll often find yourself breaking your 12 damage sword and then have to use a 6 damage club that you picked up from the dead enemy you just broke your sword on until later in the game.Grinding and collecting materials for food that you can cook or monster parts you use to create elixir is something that is fun to experiment but can also be annoying and it's highly encouraged you bring foods that can heal you up faster.As for gameplay it's a solid 5/5 stars, not once have I had lag issues or freezing and not even frame drops has happened to meThough as any Zelda fan knows they would agree that this game does break some old Zelda tradition such as the weapon breaking, another is how in past Zelda games you were able to name yourself but in here you don't get that option.I love this game and can't get enough of it and I would highly encourage getting this game (especially over the 1-2 switch game)",Another great journey,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

There's actually more I wanted to mention but it's already too long.I really wanted to give this 5 stars but couldn't quite get there.I'm not really sure how to frame this review. I'll try and make it generic and not have any plot spoilers. I played this game at least once a day for about 6 weeks (march 11th - april 24th). I don't know of a way to see an official our count but guessing I would say between 150 and 250 hours - when I did finally beat it - I did do a lot of optional things though. Also, I only played it almost entirely with the pro controller"" and a little bit with the Switch in portable-console-mode. Never used the detachable wireless controllers as a controller. I usually got around 2 1/2 - 3 hours as a portable by the way.I'll preface this by saying the last zelda i finished was Ocarina, 20 years ago. Haven't really kept up with Nintendo or zelda since then. Maybe some old zeldas through emulation. Still have TP and skyward sword on my ""to do list"".What would someone like me associate with a zelda game? A big over world with at least 8 dungeons of varying amounts of difficulty finding them, locked off areas that aren't accessible until certain items are found (like hookshot, the higher strength bracelet and the boomerang) and of course dungeons that include keys, a compass and a map.Well this zelda has a twist and that idea: instead of 8 fairly large dungeons and areas locked away until you get certain items...there's 120 relatively short shrines only four of which are required to complete the game. And there aren't really areas locked away until you get a specific item. Maybe an area is extremely difficult with only 3 hears and no stamina but it's not physically impossible to get there.This being an ""open world"" game I can't help but compare to other games of that kind, the freshest on my mind being the elder scrolls games. Skyrim for instance had weapon forging, marriages, a whole magical system, an economics system...far and away more complex than and in-depth than this in other words. But that's the way I have always remembered Zelda games: an ""RPG"" but much more ""accessible"" to kids and players who may not want to spend hundreds of hours doing everything. Actually if you were going to make an elder scrolls comparison Oblivion would be the most obvious in comparison (as I recall it had a lot of ...I want to say oblivion gates..that were optional to beat).In BotW you don't really ""level up"" and there isn't actually an experience system.  You finish shrines to get spirit orbs and then you upgrade either stamina (how long you can go before stopping to rest) or hearts (hit points). In other words you don't specialize in different skill sets. You can cook the best meal there is from the word go if you know the recipe and where to get the ingredients. And the same with archery and weapons skills: you don't get better and better at spears if you specialize in them, it's the same from the first moment as it is at the final fight. And I kind of like that.Over the course of my play through I went through several stages:1. starting the game, learning the controls, finding shrines and not towers with sheika slate scope, running from bokoblins...2. blowing myself up with bombs, continually crouching while trying to run away from mini-bosses, seeing that game over screen a lot3. being addicted to seeing what's over the next horizon, what's over there, staying up until 3am on a work night. This is probably the peak of the experience.4. having uncovered the whole map, having to track down those final shrines and finishing the side quests5. The final stage is kind of...frustrating. I didn't want to finish yet but there wasn't much left to do. The main point of side quests is get either money or ""mad loot"". But at some point I had ""four-starred"" my favorite armor and had 26k rupees so that kind of took away the motivation. So it was more ""farming mini bosses"" to get the ingredients and high level weapons I needed.So I would say you reach ""peak botw"" around 12 hearts with two divine beasts under your belt.What are the cons?- As mentioned before, I kept crouching and very inconvenient times. The analog stick that is used for movement/running, when pushed down, makes Link crouch. This frustrated me to know end. I really wish there was a ""disable crouch"" option, even if temporary. Would made things so much easier.- the technology used for the game is kind of...not powerful enough. For instance animals (or lizards) will run away and then simply disappear. For instances and dear will be right in front of me running circles and then just fade away right in front of me. I find this annoying. As is the sand seals and that can't pull me over rocks but can dive into rocks as if they were sand. It just seems like a lack of attention to detail or...maybe just a flaw in the technology. Really takes me out of the immersion.- The music. Or rather lack thereof. There's a appropriate sounds when something is chasing after Link or there's a mini-boss in the area. But a lot of times it's either generic ambient music or no music at all, just wind blow through trees. I realize Nintendo isn't on forefront of technology but if you're really going to leave out music how about some way of importing custom music? Pandora? Something? Probably too much to ask.- Even with the latest patch (as of april 25th 2017) I get some frame rate issues (I played with it on the dock/connected to a TV 99% of the time). Not very often and I don't remember it actually affecting game play. But that doesn't make it any less annoying.- I have the physical version of the game and sometimes those loading times kind of get to me. Feels like I'm in the early 90s waiting for my 1x CD ROM to load.  I did get a lot of tips for the loading screens, but I would still rather have faster loading.Neutral:- The weapon system. I think I figured out what they were going for: since there is no crafting or repair system for weapons and shields, this is the way the game upgrades your effectiveness. As you complete shrines and divine beasts the weapons slowly improve. Actually the enemies not all of them) slowly upgrade as well to be more difficult, thereby dropping improved weapons. It's supposed to be an organic thing, which it is up to a certain point.- the motion controls: technically they ""work"" but I didn't appreciate them for things like aiming the bow so the first thing I did was turn them off. There are still shrines that make you use them though.- the plot: not over the top great, no great twists or anything. Just a pretty straight forward thing. It's kind of like the plot of the movie ""the blues brothers"" now that I think about it. Link is ""getting the band back together"" for one last gig. And also bailing someone out of tough situation. Except link doesn't have a partner, it's just him trying to talk people into fighting again coming to the aid somebody. It's actually pretty impressive the way they pieced the plot together through these ""memories"" that are entirely optional and can be watched in any order yet still fits together into a cohesive whole by the end.- optional quests and mini-games. To expand your inventory capacity (for melee weapons/bows/shields) you have to trade in korok seeds. You find korok seeds but searching out of the way places for things that ""seem out of place"". Like a circle of rocks obviously missing a piece to make a full circle. Complete the circle, get a seed. Collect enough seeds and trade them for more inventory capacity. So you explore the world, solve some minor puzzles and in trade you ""earn"" more inventory space. It seems fair (I found just under 200 seeds, which sounds like a lot until you find out there's 900 total). There's also a take-a-pic-of-everything mini game thing. I was wondering at the start why there was no central repository explaining all the various enemies. And then I got the thing that allowed for photo taking. So it's ""build-your-own beastiary"". I don't know that there's a reward for a complete repository. But it is helpful. There's also some other mini-games like gliding for the longest and riding a shield down a snow path. Those are fun more than anything.- the way the monsters (and most everything else) re-spawns: I think I like it. I mean it's kind of explained in the context of the plot and it's relatively predictable. I once got stuck on a certain island the night before that re-spawn event. It was like living through ""groundhog day"" having to beat the island multiple times to try and finish it. In the ""late game"" you may start to plan all your adventures around the next re-spawn.Positives:- It is a very compelling open world. I spent many a night exploring random areas, trying to finish puzzles in shrines and fighting various mini bosses. It's often hard to put down.- the gained abilities from the start of the game makes it very fun to experiment. And the shrines make you ""think outside the box"" in your creative use of these abilities to solve the puzzle.- speaking of abilities, almost always when i couldn't figure out puzzle the answer seemed to be ""use crynosis"" (giant pillar of ice). Not sure why I had so much trouble remembering that was a thing.- I actually like a lot of the mini bosses. The Hinox (giant one-eyed things that seem to enjoy sleeping) were intimidating at first but eventually quite fun to fight. And a good source of relatively high power bows. Among other things.- the recipe/cooking system. I still don't know all the super-great recipes by name/by heart. But I know enough the create enhancements for speed/stealth/heart recovery/recovery+extra hearts/attack up/defense up/recover stamina/extra stamina wheels. And that's what I really want anyway. Never did figure out what good all those blocks of salt are for. Guess that's why I have hundreds of them.- I like the logic of the game. For instance in the starter area is a required shrine but the area is too cold to go through without losing hearts. You only have three hearts so this is rather important. There are hints of a recipe that will provide cold resistance as well as a way to get a warm vest. But I didn't know how to cook or that the ""warm doublet"" was an option. So as is probably logical i used a torch to provide just enough warmth to get through the cold area. Of course there are also bad guys to get through along the way and the torch goes out when you switch to a weapon so then you have to find some place to re-light a torch. You can also light wood weapons on fire of course. And actually where you start finding element enhanced weapons this works the same way: in the hot desert equip a great ice sword to stay a little cooler (and a fireblade to stay a little warmer). There's also things like ice-based enemies that die in one hit with a fire weapon, and fire enemies that die from ice weapons. Just makes sense.- Actually, you indirectly learn how to do with lightning strikes pretty quickly (if you have metal weapons equipped you'll likely get struck by lightning). And this knowledge comes in handy with the electricity-based puzzles (metal weapons conduct electricity). As does water. Comes in handy for disabling groups of enemies standing in water.- It seems like for every ""that's not fair"" element you find there is a ""that's very generous of you"" element to counter it. For instance it's not at all difficult to stumble across an enemy entirely over your head in abilities/hit points/etc. and can insta-kill you without much more than a look. As if to counter this you have the transportation/beam out ability you get pretty much first thing. At any moment/any time you can bring up the map and warp away without any consequences of any kind. About to drown? Or part way up a mountain and out of stamina? Laser about the take your head off? No problem, bring up the map and warp away. Doesn't cost any rupees or hearts or anything nor are there restrictions around enemies being around etc. Insta-gone.- the armor system: lets just say collect everything you see that you can pick up. Every much room, every firefly, every apple, every horn. Because you will need it, and I don't think there's any sort of limit to how big that stack of teeth can get (or I didn't find the limit, anyway). You'll need it to upgrade your armor, which you will want to do for the ""set bonus"". There's the fireproof suit for walking around on death mountain without instantly catching on fire. There's the rock climbing suit for super fast climbing, there's the sheika outfit for super-stealth, there also one for extreme cold and extreme heat. The one that allows for walking around inside in a volcano doesn't help for traveling in the desert. Not sure why. Point is you will probably want that extreme cold outfit upgrade so you're ""unfreezable"" and the rubber suite upgraded so your ""unshockable"". And extreme heat one so you're not dressed as...well lets not spoil the surprise.- the combat system: the sooner you learn the parry/super dodge system the better off you'll be. Took me forever to get the hang of it. But it's definitely worth it. Lets just say you can kill the guardians in the starter area with nothing more than a pot lid...How much one likes this game I think will be directly proportional to how open one is to open world games (like the elder scrolls series). I never had any trouble figuring out where to go or what to do next in this game (and Impa is there to remind you). The plot is entirely optional as are the ""divine beasts"" and 116 of 120 shrines. You can waste time time and do whatever you want in any random order you like. That's either terrifyingly flexible or wonderfully freeing, depending on your tastes. Think of it as a really watered down version of all the famous open world franchises. Which isn't a bad thing.One tip to leave you with: that area around Zora's domain, the long windy road with all the lizard men, that is definitely the place for gathering arrows. And you will run low on arrows...a lot. I was doing that every re-spawn time for a while there.","BotW really...

You can do as little or as much as you want. It’s your world.The Good Stuff:Gameplay. This is the best 3D Zelda game to date. I got the itch to replay Twilight Princess HD and realized you can never go back.The graphics. Breath of the Wild looks great on the Switch and feels like a truer sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii/3DS than Xenoblade Chronicles X on the Wii U (Which is an awful game). While the Wii U version suffers from low framerate during many parts (even after the patch), the Switch version doesn't seem to have any issues.Music. Since this game is all about atmosphere, Nintendo decided to go with a softer, more subtle background music for most of the game. There is also various music for different areas, but not as catchy as previous Zelda games.No handholding. The game doesn't treat you like you've never played a video game before. While there is a ""tutorial"" section at the start, it feels very natural.Voice Acting. This is the first Zelda game to feature voice acting but it's used lightly. You're still going to click through tons of text adjoined by grunts and groans.The Bad Stuff:Tediousness. You will be finding/hunting food and other items. You must cook your food to make hearts and elixirs using recipes. It’s all trial and error. You will have to constantly find new weapons, shields, and bows as they all break. You will need to upgrade slots to hold more of these items. Lastly, you must increase your hearts AND stamina. Menus and item selection are all over the place and very confusing to use. You can access a weapons menu 2 different ways, but only one allows you to drop them. Why not both? They really needed to work more on this.Controls. Those tiny joycons simply don't cut it as a handheld controller. I'm constantly accidently pushing on the control stick when trying to move around the camera during a battle (causing me to zoom in instead). The position of the right stick is also not very ideal. I finally got a Pro Controller and everything is much better.Voices. Obviously adding voices to a Zelda game is going to be controversial. Zelda Cdi anyone? While Link doesn't talk for some reason, almost everyone is well voiced except for Mipha (Zora Princess). She's awful. Luckily, the others aren't so bad. A lot of people complain about Zelda, but I find her to be acceptable.Overall, if you're a Zelda fan there is a whole world to discover and enjoy. You can spend 60+ hours playing around and still not even start the main storyline. Or, you can just jump right into the story and finish it as quickly as you choose. The game is completely open and allows you to play it however you see fit.",The Best Version By Far.,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

I'm a huge fan of open world games in general, so it already had that going for it, but I honestly thought it did just about everything right.Visuals:  Absolutely beautiful.  The world is incredibly colorful and beautifully rendered.  The character designs are lively and do a fantastic job of evoking their original iterations from prior games with a new flair and visual appeal (I said I didn't put any 'serious' effort into the old games, not that I hadn't played them).Sound/Music:  Also beautiful.  Updated takes on classic sounds and tunes melding perfectly with some newly orchestrated pieces.  The voice acting is a little 50/50, but the ones that do a good job (like the actress voicing Zelda) are FANTASTIC and the others are nod BAD per se, just kinda goofy, like saturday morning cartoon goofy.Story:  Waaaaay better than I expected.  The memories you unlock of Link and Zelda's past are quite well written.  Some of the side characters are your standard character archetypes, but nothing too cheesy.Controls:  I would probably take a half point off for the horse riding and the countering mechanics.  Those are harder to use than I feel they should have been.  Personally, I just never used a horse and did more dodging that blocking, so it evened out.  Everything else is really solid.  Combat, movement, inventory management, all fluid and intuitive.I'd give this a solid 9/10 (rounded up to 5 stars)",Gonna be honest here . . . this is the first Legend of Zelda game I ever really put any serious effort into . . .,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

The Zelda series has a new champion.  Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and feels destined to be a classic.The Legend of Zelda series is, I must admit, my favorite video game series of all time (which is my favorite past-time) I have been absolutely obsessed with Zelda since I first played Ocarina of Time at the age of ten, sometimes obsessed to a rather unhealthy degree.  I have loved every Zelda game, and especially every 3D Zelda, though none of them quite captured the same feeling of wonder and exploration.  Until very recently, I would rank Ocarina of Time as my favorite video game of all time, but it looks as though that mantle is finally being passed to another game.  Breath of the Wild feels like the Zelda game Nintendo has always wanted to make, but hasn’t been able to do to technological constraints or what have you.  This game feels like the essence of what Zelda is, and always has been, about.  While this is a lengthy review, this is a game that warrants such a lengthy review.Story:  The story to this game begins in a place called the chamber of resurrection.  Our hero, Link, has been asleep in a form of stasis for 100 years.  When he awakes, he finds the land of Hyrule in ruins, starting with the desolate Temple of Time on the Great Plateau, the starting location.  Link is told by a voice in his head that he must be the light to shine upon the land of Hyrule.  After meeting a mysterious old man (throwback to the original Zelda game there) Link sets out on his quest to save Hyrule from the evil monster inside Hyrule Castle, known as the Calamity Ganon.  Without spoiling too much of this story, I will only say that it is probably the most cinematic Zelda story to date.  The fact that this game has voice acting, which is a first for the Zelda series, adds a lot of weight to the key story moments.  The characters feel far more fleshed out, and they feel genuinely human.  This game’s version of the titular princess Zelda might be the most relatable and interesting incarnation of the character to date, as she has genuine depth to her character.  The other pivotal characters also feel uniquely more fleshed out as well, providing some of the most memorable story cut-scenes in a Zelda game, or any Nintendo game.  Though Wind Waker and Skyward Sword might rival it, this is probably the best Zelda story to date.  It does a great job of immersing you into the Gameplay and the world itself.  Moreover, as you explore the world, you feel as though a story is being told through the exploration itself.  One of the ingenious methods to the story-telling in this game is how it is told in a nonlinear nature, meaning that you can track down different pieces of the story in any order, and still have it all make sense in the end.  Parts of the story are also optional, so it doesn’t ever feel like it’s spoon-fed to you, which is a good thing.Presentation:  Right off the bat, I must say that Breath of the Wild is one of the most Gorgeous looking games that has ever been made to me.  The simple, soft and vibrant colors also contain a hidden elegance and sophistication that can convey lots of emotion both in terms of story and Gameplay.  The style feels reminiscent of Skyward Sword’s, which I also adored, but taken to the next level.  This is the first Zelda title to be made in HD, and it shows.  The character designs are flawless, and unforgettable.  The stunning lighting effect, particularly when the sun rises and sets, remain beautiful to watch from start to finish, and the whole game just looks fantastic.  This is magnified on the Nintendo Switch, with longer draw distances and a better performance overall than the Wii U version.  There were still some frame-rate drops during moments in the game, particularly during battle moments against the Moblin enemies.  While the frame-rate hiccups are still noticeable on the Switch, the game runs noticeably better overall.  This minor complaint never ruined the game, or the immersion for me.I for one love the choice of music in this game.  The subtle but brilliant use of piano cords make the world feel more natural and organic, and is contrasted brilliantly with the high-energy guardian themes and shrine theme.  This, in a way, helps the thematic element of nature versus technology play out in its sound design.  While the music may not be something you would listen to outside of the game in the same way you would with previous Zelda games, I believe the music and sound design is perfect for this game.  That said, the horse riding theme, Hateno village, and Hyrule Castle are amazing pieces. The Hateno Village theme is simple and beautiful.  The voice acting is also very solid, and I would love to see future Zelda games expand on it even more.What it comes down to is that the visual style choices, and the music help to make this, arguably, the most immersive and atmospheric open-world game I have ever played, and it serves the gameplay perfectly.Gameplay:  This is the best and most top-notch Gameplay I have ever experienced, period.  The controls are so darn good that you could bounce a dime of them and get change leftover.  As a veteran Zelda player, there was a learning curve to the controls at first, but after getting accustomed to them, they really did feel like second nature.  This is the first 3D Zelda to have a jump button, a simple addition that changes the Gameplay mechanics significantly.  Furthermore, the ability to climb in this game also adds a whole new dimension to the Gameplay.This time around, the enemy AI is quite advanced for a Zelda title.  The enemies also do quite a bit more damage to Link than they ever have before in a 3D title.  What this means is that every encounter, and combat situation feels dangerous, and as though something is at stake.  Link’s arsenal of weapons this time around includes far more than just a single sword, but many swords, as well as sticks, axes, spears, clubs, magic rods, and more.  You also have a plethora of shields to use, and bows to use.  The weapons in this game do break after being used a bit, which might be a point of contention to some.  I love this mechanic, and feel that it forces you as the player to think and be strategic as to how you approach every encounter with an enemy.  Link can also use stealth to sneak up on his enemies, destroy exploding barrels nearby and watch the enemies scream in horror (such as satisfying feeling,) or even use his rune abilities to take the enemies out before they know what hit them (more on that later.)  The possibilities in this game feel almost endless.  The coolest move Link can pull off in this game is the flurry rush; when fighting an enemy close-up, if you dodge just in time, Link will do a dodge or backflip in slow-motion, and proceed by striking the enemy several times, ending them in the process.  It’s the coolest thing ever.In this game, Link uses a plethora of abilities known as the Rune abilities.  With these abilities, Link can create remote bombs that he can explode upon impact whenever desired.  You can also use Cryonis, which creates ice blocks from water, which can be used as platforms to climb.  You can use what is called stasis, which temporarily freezes objects in place, allowing you to hit them several times, after which point they go flying every which way.  Then there is Magnesis, which is my favorite.  This allows Link to push, pull, and lift heavy metal objects from afar, and use them to make paths, or even drop them on enemies from a distance.  You’ll often stumble upon scenarios, particularly in the dungeons and shrines, that allow you to find your own clever ways of solving puzzles with these brilliant and fun mechanics.  Like every aspect of the game, the experimentation alone will soak up hours of your life.Speaking of shrines and dungeons, the dungeons in this game are vastly different than in previous Zelda games.  Whereas previous Zelda’s had you collect keys, a key item, in order to make it to the final boss fight, this game’s dungeons are more based around experimentation and manipulation.  Through using Link’s powers and abilities, as well as the map in this game, it allows Link to manipulate the layout of the dungeon, and essentially bend them to his will.  This is another aspect of this Zelda that feels so fresh and fun.  The bosses at the end of the dungeon are also really fun to fight.  While the game only has four main dungeons, there are more than 100 mini shrines throughout.  The shrines are essentially bite-sized dungeons, and play-out as such on a micro level.  Many of them require you to use your rune abilities to solve them and progress, while others have you engage in a little boss fight of sorts with a guardian robot.  Needless to say, these shrines are fantastic and provide some of the most enjoyable and mind-bending scenarios I’ve ever encountered, and manage to surprise at every turn.  Moreover, the whole over-world almost feels like one giant, outdoor dungeon.  What I mean by that is that while it isn’t literally a huge dungeon, you begin solving puzzles and thinking about where, and how you want to proceed to the next shrine or dungeon right of the bat.  Simply getting to these shrines and dungeons feels like a puzzle in and of itself.Being a truly open-world game, this game’s real obstacle, beyond even the enemies and the dungeons, is the world itself.  This game is an open world adventure game, but it’s also a survival one.  This world feels alive.  The weather changes, the wild-life has a mind of its own, and the world will try to kill you in a multitude of ways.  Whether it be by falling from foolishly attempting to climb massive heights, to lightning striking your metal items, to the wild animals such as bears and wolves that see you as their next meal.  Furthermore, the realistic and ingenious physics engine makes the game world feel more natural.The trick then, is to use the world to your advantage.  By hunting wild animals and gathering supplies and ingredients, Link can cook a multitude of dishes and elixirs to refill both his heart meter (no hearts in pots or grass in this game) or his stamina gauge.  You can hunt just about any wild animal you see in the wild.  Cooked meat is always more effective than raw meat in straightening you, and you can combine it with other ingredients like fruits, vegetables, or grains and wheat to increase their effect.  You can make potions by combining critters such as lizards, frogs, or bugs with monster parts that provide different temporary stat boosts.  Just look out for the dubious food!  You can also break chunks of rocks to find minerals, ore, and other materials.  By buying and selling these goods, you create your own in game economy of sorts.The other aspect of this game that makes it truly feel like the “open air” experience that Eji Aonuma called it is none other than the glorious climbing mechanic.  You can climb almost anything in this game, whether it be a rock face, a cliff, buildings, towers, Hyrule Castle itself, the Temple of Time, you name it.  You can even climb trees, and certain rock monsters that appear throughout the world.  Climbing is yet another big component and aspect to this game that Nintendo really got down pat, and it does feel like a game changer.  I’ve played several games where you can climb certain things, like Assassin’s Creed or Uncharted, but never has it been this freeing in how you can do it.  This simple yet elegant mechanic really makes the already huge world feel even bigger.  Climbing will slowly eat up your stamina gauge, so it’s up to you to figure out how you want to approach it, and finding little footholds is always a good way to rest when you need to.  The only places you can’t climb every wall is in the dungeons and the shrines.  The other open-air aspect to this world is the paraglider.  When you reach the top of the mountain or a tower, you don’t need to worry about climbing all the way back down.  Now, Link can simply jump off the cliff, and glide down to the world below ala Batman.  This mechanic remains euphoric from start to finish.  It is also an ingenious way to fix what could have been a potential problem before it happened, by allowing you to breezily get down a mountain pf tower right off the bat without having to climb all the way back down.In this game, you can catch any number of wild horses, tame them, and check them into a stable.  In past Zelda’s, your horse was Epona, and it was the only horse you could get.  Here, there are several horses, some are harder to get than others, and they all have different stats.  When you do catch your horse, it really does feel like your own horse, since you caught it, tamed it, and gave it a name.  You can hold up to five horses at any given time, and ride around the world, into the villages, and even approach combat while on horseback with your melee weapons and bows.  As someone who finds joy and excitement by simply exploring the game world, and doing random things, riding around Hyrule has never felt more fun.  I used to love doing that all the way back in Twilight Princess, and this aspect puts that game to shame.  The Horses can die, which may seem annoying to some, but I love it as, once again, it offers more strategy and thinking than previous games.  When fighting a Guardian, it’s better going up against it on horseback as you have the element of speed on your side.Unlike previous Zelda games, where boss battles were restricted to the dungeons themselves, here in Breath of the Wild, you will often encounter boss like enemies in the world.  These come in the form of giant rock monsters (Stone Talus,) Centaur-like creatures (Lynels, another throwback to Zelda on NES,) and the now iconic game enemy known as the Guardian’s (octopus-like robots that attempt to kill you throughout the game.)  You can approach these enemies however you choose, or not approach them at all and leave them be at first.  Throughout the game, as you become more powerful, you may be bold enough to take them on, it is all up to you.  The first time I killed a Guardian was a defining moment for me, as was my first Lynel kill.  What’s amazing is that even after you have several of the key upgrades, the enemies still feel like a threat.What makes the Gameplay in Breath of the Wild so good, and so perfect, is that you as the player can literally approach it however you want.  The whole world is your oyster, and it’s up to you to figure out how you want to use it.Replay value.  This game has lots of reason to play even after your first initial playthrough, which will likely take at least forty hours if you just do the main story.  I have played this game from start to finish a few times already (and probably will several more times.)  As it stands, you can find all of the optional things in the game (the Master Sword itself is optional,) Find and beat all of the shrines, collect all of the Korok seeds (plant like creature fans may know from Wind Waker,) and do any number of side-quests.  The side-quests I have done have all been tremendously fun, and while the rewards may be simple, just playing them feels like a reward.  You can help herd cucoos for a chicken-freak in Kakariko village, catch a royal white-steed, help a man start a village from the ground-up, and even build your own house in Hateno Village.  This game has tons of replay value, apart from just the urge to go back and play it again.  Because of the open-ended nonlinear nature of this game, you can replay the game from start to finish, and take a completely different path, even so far as taking on the last boss right away (though not a good idea if you value your life.)  Just experimenting with all the different weapons, finding all the different locations and using your rune abilities will keep you distracted for quite some time.**Nintendo Switch differences:Having played this game on the Switch as well as the Wii U, I can safely say that either version will deliver an incredible experience.  That said, the Switch version is probably ever so slightly the superior version.  Apart from running a little bit better, I found the switch controller very comfortable, particularly with how easy it is the detach the joy-cons from the controller slots to the tablet-screen.  Speaking of which, playing this game on the go is a lot of fun.  I would recommend saving the key story moments for the TV, but playing the game casually undocked with the Switch screen has felt great. **Verdict:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and a game I feel will be looked at as a timeless classic.  While it isn’t literally “perfect,” it has its occasional frame-rate issues, and the very occasional camera issue, it is, to me, as close to flawless as video game’s get.  I haven’t been this immersed, this addicted, or simply had this much fun with a single player game in years, if not decades.  This is the best game Nintendo has made in likely the past twenty years, if not ever.  I have no regrets in saying I am ready to move on from Ocarina of Time being my all-time favorite video game, as Breath of the Wild now takes the cake.  This is the game that really feels tailored to be played however you choose.  It feels like the fully realized Zelda game that Nintendo has always wanted to make, and the one we as fans have been salivating for.  A new Zelda of any kind is always a big deal, but this one feels uniquely special.  I hyped this game to Death Mountain and back, and not only does it meet expectations, it defies them.  This feels like a giant playground full of joy, wonder, discovery exploration, and fun.  This is a game of survival, action, adventure, comedy, sadness, joy, and excitement, all wrapped into one package.  To say it bluntly, this has everything that makes Gaming such a great past-time to me, and millions of people, and it manages to capture the essence of Zelda most of all.  This is an absolute must-buy, and a must play.  I would honestly encourage you to get a Wii U, or a Nintendo Switch if you do not already have one, to experience this Masterpiece.  So get it, play it, enjoy it, and take a Breath of the magnificent Wild.Cons:Occasional frame-rate issuesPros:Sublime ControlsPerfect, Flawless, and incredible GameplayMasterful Open-World ExplorationFreedom and personal choiceMechanics encourage experimentationFresh new dungeon designAmazing art directionBrilliant music and sound designGreat Voice ActingGreat Story and awesome charactersLots of secrets to findLots of replay valueOverall: 10/10Peace, Dana",Video Gaming Perfection,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

The switch version is the definitive version sporting a higher resolution, better sound quality and now you can truly take it on the go. I won't say everybody will enjoy it but i highly recommend buying it or renting it it's definitely worth testing out.",Wonderful game in my opinion it deserves all the praise ...,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,

The game is not perfect but oh man this game is simply amazing! There is so much to do and see here it boggles my mind when I think about the amount of work and effort (not to mention love) the creators and developers put into this game. Let this be your first Nintendo Switch game and get Super Mario Odessey later.,You're in for a treat!,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,
