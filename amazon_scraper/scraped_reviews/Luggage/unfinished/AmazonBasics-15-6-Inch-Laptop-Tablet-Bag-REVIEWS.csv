It is not one to attract dirt to begin with.There is a padding in it to protect main compartment.That main compartment divided into 2 sections, one of which easily fits a 14 inch laptop, Amazon Kindle and a large phone if needed. Second section can be used to keep a notepad or stack of Letter-format papers without folding those sheets.There is also a smaller pocket in that main compartment, where you can store keys, small mirror, memory sticks, documents etc.No, I would not advise to put an apple or a sandwich there. Banana, at most.The front compartment can hold notepad, multiple pen, keys, passes, and earphones.

When I travel, I do so by car, so a bag that could endure the rigors of air travel wasn’t necessary. I don’t use shoulder straps, so the problem with the strap clips breaking was of no concern. For what I need the bag for, it does a good job. I have enough room for the electric cord and the separate cd/dvd rom drive my computer needs as well as enough space for a modest number of files. If I used a separate mouse, that would fit too. I am retired, so this meets my needs at a modest price. If I were still working, it would be too small & not up to daily travels. The padding situation at the bottom of the main compartment seems to have been improved somewhat. The strap I’m not using still has the plastic clips. If you plan to buy this and use the strap, you might be able to reinforce it with small carabiners, but choosing another case might be a better choice. I’m happy with it, but my needs are fairly unique.",Meets Modest Needs at a Modest Price,Size: 15.6 InchStyle: 1-packConfiguration: BagVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

I did some research online to find good ways of carrying this large heavy laptop and all the recommendations went to a backpack style bag (see ASUS ROG Gaming Laptop Bag, or Everki Titan). I have always carried my laptops in a laptop style carrying case with a handle and shoulder strap. Of the few laptop style cases that would fit, this seemed to be the style I was looking for.Cons:Right out of the box, I had my doubts about the case. For one, it was very very light (like half the weight of previous cases for smaller lighter laptops, like Dell products). When your carrying something small and relatively inexpensive, light can be helpful as the extra padding is not needed. Light for heavy, gaming style laptops which weight in upwards of 8lbs is not what is needed. To continue I will compare this case to my old Dell laptop bag which carried my ASUS G50vt.This Case Logic case has about a quarter inch of padding around the edges of the computer, with the edging strip being sewn into the case. The Dell had about an inch and a half of denser padding with a zipper around the bottom allowing you to remove the padding and custom cut it to your computer dimensions. The Case Logic case does have a hook and loop strap allowing you to keep you computer on one side of the case if the computer doesn’t fit perfectly. This means that unless your computer does fit perfectly, your computer will always make the case off balance in one direction. Continuing in the primary duty of a case (protection) the case is about as stiff as a wet noodle. Without any resistance, you can contort the case along its side twisting it back and forth (a big confidence booster). Also, with the computer inside and the power cord and block zipped in the smaller pocket, the sides collapse onto where the computer compartment is. I wont comment on the shoulder strap as I haven’t used it.",Long lasting and durable! 8 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE!,Size: 15.6 InchStyle: 1-packConfiguration: BagVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

This turned out to be a little smaller than I'd hoped, though.  I had just come back from a trip, where I'd used my trusty old clutch bag with shoulder strap to carry a couple of tablets, some chargers and cables, and a magazine or two.  The old bag had seen better days, so I looked on Amazon and found this bag, which I thought was about the same size as my old one.  It was delivered promptly with Prime, and although it was well-constructed and had more compartments than my old bag, it was just about an inch too short if I ever wanted to put my HP laptop in it.Here's where the story gets weird, and where I learned a valuable lesson.  I decided to buy the same basic bag in the 15.6 inch size, and then return this 14 inch one.  The 15.6 arrived and was perfect in every way.  So I got back on Amazon and prepared to return the 14 inch model, only to find that I would be charged return shipping (unlike the free Prime shipping to send it to me).  The shipping charge would be $6.38, for an item that only cost $13 and change!!  Needless to say, I kept both bags.  The 15.6 is now my favorite travel bag, and I use the 14 inch as a general purpose bag to carry documents, folders, and a few pens for meetings.",Great Bag. awesome value.

The Targus was very nice also, and it was a tough decision.  But I ended up keeping the Amazon bag and sending the Targus back.  I have posted the same review for both items.Here are the reasons I liked the Amazon bag.- Fit my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 perfectly.  The Targus is slightly bigger, so the Pro fits in there nicely as well, but I was going for the smallest fit possible that still held my desired items.- Better made than the Targus. Nice shoulder strap, and the zippers are solid metal and zip/unzip very smooth.  The Targus felt cheaper, though it is more expensive.- Strap on the back that allows you to slide it over the handles of a rolling overhead luggage bag.  (The Targus listing, as well as the instructions that came with the Targus claims it has this feature as well, but inexplicably, the bag I received does *not* have these straps.)- The Amazon bag is half the price as the Targus bag.Now, regarding fit.  I won't say that it is a tight fit, because everything I need fits into the Amazon bag perfectly.  But if you have a large amount of extra travel items, this may not work for you.  I will list the items that I have fit into the Amazon bag comfortably:Main pocket:- Surface Pro 3- Small writing notebook- Kindle paperwhiteBig side pocket:- HDMI adapter- Two pens (include the touch pen)- Stack of business cards- Flash drive- USB adapter for multiple USB ports- Small battery backup for my poneSmall side pocket:- Surface power cordIt seems like a lot, but most of those items are pretty small, so take that into consideration.  For instance, I probably wouldn't be able to get my USB mouse into the bag easily. It is the small side pocket where I place the power cord that is the tightest fit.  I can't just shove the power cord into the pocket, I have to wrap up the cable nicely and then slide it into the pocket.So, if you are worried about space, take this into consideration.  In that case, I would strongly recommend the Targus bag.  Even though I sent it back, I would have been happy with that one as well.  The way the side pocket of the Targus is designed, you could fit significantly more into the side pocket than you can with the Amazon bag, at only slightly more bulk overall.If you have a Surface Pro 3, I think you will be happy with either bag.

It is large enough to easily carry a tablet computer, its accessories, plus enough room for a small amount of paperwork, pens, pencils, etc.  It has hand-carry handles plus a detachable shoulder strap.  The one flaw I see is that the shoulder strap has a shoulder pad which simply slides on the strap and needs some way to attach it in place, so it is not necessary to position it each time you want to carry the bag on your shoulder.  Also, the clips on the end of the strap are made to rotate 360 degrees, which means that if you grab the bag to sling it over your shoulder on the way out the door, you may have to stop and untwist the strap to get it to lay flat on the shoulder.  That is several sentences to describe minor issues with the overall design of the bag.  In reality it is a great tote bag, offered at a really good price.

The 15"" version has sufficient interior space in the divided main compartment to comfortably carry a 13"" laptop, an iPad Air, and several books or notebooks. The smaller tablet pocket in the main compartment is perfectly sized to completely contain the Air, and there's enough padding along the bottom for peace of mind. The two exterior compartments are exceptionally useful as well, and the larger compartment has three pockets that are perfectly sized for chargers, cables, headphones, or whatever you need to take with you.For the price, I wasn't expecting much, but this little bag has replaced a much more expensive Timbuk2 messenger bag for day-to-day use and it's simple and unassuming enough that I feel comfortable using it in more professional settings. The overall fit and finish is easily up to par with anything you'll find for double or even triple the price and, while it's not going to match high-end bags, it's good enough to not look or feel cheap. The size also bears note - I ordered the 15"" bag for a 13"" laptop because I knew I'd need the extra space, but I was concerned about the bag feeling too large. It's not. The 15"" version is extremely slim and much, much smaller than most messenger bags or backpacks designed to carry large laptops.This bag is good enough that I'd still be giving it 5-stars at $40 or $50. For under $20, there's just nothing even comparable.ONE YEAR UPDATE: A few build quality issues have popped up after a year or so of daily use. The interior tablet pocket is beginning to rip where it's attached to the interior lining, and the shoulder strap pad is tearing. Aside from these two problems, the case bag has held up remarkably well to being thrown and dragged around five to six days per week.

Before buying, I looked at all of the 1 star ratings, and a common theme throughout them was that the strap's end clip broke while the bag was being carried on the shoulder, and the person ruined their laptop due to it being dropped and landing on a corner on a hard surface.  Given that, I took a close look at item this when I received the bag.  The end clips on the strap are indeed plastic, and they look like they just snap together to make the swivel end piece.  It's easy to see how under load the swivel could come apart from the weight of a loaded bag.  My solution:  I trashed the strap that came with the bag and substituted for it another, more substantial one with metal clips that I happened to have laying around.

The Surface Pro tablet fits comfortably in the 14-inch bag with room to spare. I was very happy with my previous bag - an old one from pre-tablet days that came with an AlphaSmart I bought a long time ago. That bag was incredibly durable and lasted a lot longer than the device that came with it, but the zipper finally broke. So, I was looking for a new bag that didn't unzip all the way down. If the zipper breaks apart suddenly on a bag that unzips all the way to the bottom, your computer might hit the floor.Pros about this bag:1. It only zips along the top, so nothing is going to fall out the bottom if the zipper breaks.2. Lots of nice pockets. I can separate all the cords now.3. The material is slightly slick - not too much, but just enough that pet fur doesn't seem to cling to it as much. My cat loves snuggling up with a warm computer bag, and it doesn't seem to show as much on this one as on my old one.4. It's lightweight and affordable.Cons:The only con I've found so far is the shoulder strap. The clasps are made of plastic and look pretty breakable. Also, the padding part is ridiculously wide. It doesn't lie flat against my shoulder. I guess it's made for a giant football player or something. I removed the shoulder strap entirely and replaced it with an old one I had that has metal clasps and a shorter shoulder pad.If the strap was better, this bag would be a 5.

Construction seems very solid all around, padding is minimal but firm and sufficient, straps seem durable. Lots of different pockets on the inside (including three interior pockets in the larger front compartment, as per the photo) and three separate compartments overall, so there are many ways to separate your stuff and room for all the essentials. The overall look is trim and attractive, the zippers and smooth and seem sturdy, and it's a nice light weight.Downsides? No dealbreakers, just lack of refinements or niceties. There are no feet on the bottom of the case, so it's just resting on the same material as the rest of the exterior. So far it's holding up fine, but it is more slippery than rubber feet would be, so it tends to slide down and lay flat on its back if you rest it at an angle. The relatively narrow thickness of the case magnifies this effect. The shoulder strap seems fine, but the plastic hooks at either end don't rotate quite as smoothly as metal would, so the strap tends to get twisted pretty easily. The interior fabric has held up well for me, but it is fairly thin and makes a bit of a pronounced crinkly sound when you access the interior pockets. The aforementioned relative thinness of the case back to front does limit what you can stuff into the bag - I've had a laptop, file folder, phone/wallet/etc, and not overly thick book all layered inside, and that fills up its thickness pretty well. Definitely on the narrow side of cases, but then again that's part of why I bought it. Wanted something trim and efficient, not heavy and bulky.Overall, very satisfied with it and glad I got it. If I could change one thing, it would be to have rubber feet or some other kind of protective traction on the bottom. Apart from that, the ""basics"" in this bag are acceptable and make it a great deal.","Basic but solid, attractive, and trim - a good buy",Size: 14 InchStyle: 1-packConfiguration: BagVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

For the previous year or so I've been using the very nice, and very expensive leather Twelve South Book Book case. While it's a very classy looking case, its functionality is pretty much limited to being a leather zippered sleeve; an expensive leather sleeve that ended up being useless because the zippers on each side broke rendering it impossible to close. When I received this bag the other day it reminded me of why I never buy super expensive luggage. One reason is that more often than not it's a brand name that's causing the price to be premium and they generally don't last longer than smart luggage purchases that sell for often 1/10th or 1/8th the price.  This bag represents a perfect analogy to that.Undoubtedly this bag is made in China but guess what? More often than not, the real expensive ones are too. This bag appears to be made of high quality ballistic nylon. The zippers are thick and seem as though they'll last a lifetime but even if they last only a year it's still a great bag. In addition to the main zippered section for the laptop there are two additional zippered sections one is ideal for storing a standard sized external hard drive. The other,larger pouch Is perfect  for storing the laptop's power cord.Furthermore, the handles make it one of the most comfortable bags to carry I've ever owned they're thick and soft, and seem sturdy. There's also a padded shoulder strap! It's simply remarkable for the price!Finally, I like buying new things. I'd prefer to buy a great quality bag like this for $10 to $13, use the heck out of it for a year or so, then buy another one. It's sort of like why I never bought one of those ridiculously priced vacuums that are sold door to door and you can paint your house or wash your car with. When one spends big bucks on an item like that, or like this, one is inclined to use it until it's just no good anymore, which may be a lifetime but will still require costly maintenance. Who wants to never get a new vacuum cleaner and deny themselves of the latest and greatest technology? The person who spends $1,000 or more on something they think is great because of all the bells and whistles. That's who. However, in a few years there's better bells and whistles but people don't buy what they'd prefer to have because they paid for a product they thought they wanted to last their lifetime.So, after a year of traveling with this and getting it all scuffed up, I'll have no concern about buying a new one and I'll experience the enjoyment of getting a new one, that will likely have a few better design items.For my purposes and lifestyle, this is about as close to the perfect purchase as it gets.In summary, I think you can buy this product with the utmost of confidence.",The quality/price ratio is truly amazing,Size: 11.6 InchStyle: 1-packConfiguration: BagVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

The smaller number of pockets is enough for my essentials but no more which is probably for the best. Weighs only 13 oz, almost a full pound lighter than my last bag (28 oz). Gave all the seams a good tug when I first opened the box and everything feels tightly sewn.As the 1-star reviews have said, the shoulder strap is trash. Plastic clips? really?? I do like the nice long shoulder pad so I slipped that off and put it on my old metal-clipped strap. I wish the rings on the bag itself were metal instead of plastic but oh well. Light weight is a tradeoff that means very little padding. After replacing the strap I'm not too worried about drops but I may slip some extra foam in the bottom just in case. There's zero internal padding between pockets, not a huge concern but it makes the thin fabric dividers feel floppy and ill-fitting. Make sure you get the right size for your laptop or your stuff will slide around a lot.Overall it's a solid bag for the price and better than some I've seen at twice the price. If only it had all metal strap hardware, stiffer fabric on the internal pockets, and juuust a bit more padding then it would be perfect, but as it is I'll be satisfied using it every day.",Decent bag for a great price with minor shortcomings,Size: 15.6 InchStyle: 1-packConfiguration: BagVerified Purchase,

The bag works well, but I have had one glaring problem with it. The clip for the bag's strap cut a hole in the bag's fabric. This hole exposes the laptop compartment to air, moisture, all the things I want the bag to protect it from. This is an inexpensive bag, I wasn't expecting it to last forever. I was hoping to get more than 6 months out of it, and I am particularly annoyed that the bag's own hardware caused the hole the in bag. This is why I'm bringing my rating down to 2 stars.My original 4-star review, written when I'd been using the bag for less than a week, follows:This is a good quality bag, with padding to protect a laptop. This has enough pockets and room to carry your everyday items without being bulky. (I can carry a large file folder, a pencil case, a pad, and some cables/plugs etc, along with a 15"" laptop.) I've only had it a few days now, so I can't speak to its long-term durability. But it feels solid and well-constructed. The padded shoulder strap and handles are a nice touch.There are two things I wish were a little different. One, I wish the laptop section were separate from the main section. The whole compartment is padded, but anything in that compartment can bang against the laptop. (The very delicate retina displays on current Mac laptops make me worried about this.) Two, I wish the bag had one or two outside pockets for storing an umbrella and water bottle. Those are two everyday items I often want to carry with me.

Believe it or not this is not easy to find in Amazon because some of these bags only hold the netbook without the charger, and has all kinds of designer fluff that I did not want. I did manage to find a reasonable priced bag with a clam-shelled design from a warehouse deal, but the zipper was broken and I had to return it. Also there was no pouch for holding the charger.I was worried that I would not like the material or the bag since Amazon sells goods and does not design them, but my worries were put to rest my 11.6 inch Acer netbook would fit like a glove inside, and there was even ample room to put  spare earphones which I did put inside with the charger. I also can put a spare mouse inside If I decide to do prolong travelling. The zippers and orange tags on the front adds a professional touch. The pouch has ample room to put in accessories and other important things like pens and small notepads.Zippers have not succumbed to failure or normal wear like other bags.Cons:The shoulder strap is not attached and is inside the bag it only takes a little technical know-how to put it on, but I can understand why someone would be upset when they saw the picture and unwrapped the box without the strap being attached.Like all bags the bag does cling to dirt, but I have another sleeve from another company that stains as well and believe it or not that bag has more dirt than this Amazon Bag. I suggest you buy a bag that is made out of leather skin, and to pay more for that specific piece of luxury.Some people might be put off by the Amazon logo, but not me I am actually proud to own this product.Final Thoughts:I am more than impressed with this bag and I have waited a few months to give it a review because I wanted to see how it holds up to the daily grind and I'm glad I did, so I can give an objective review. It does stain a little easy because after I left it out for a few months  I can see little white stains by  the front pouch and dust clinging to the bag. I haven't tested the bag to normal wear and haven't traveled much with it, but it will stain easy from the outside from normal use. This is the only reason I haven't given a 5 star rating. I wish I can give it a 4.5 out of the price and features alone, but it is the little things of the strap and staining  which might put some people off including myself.Since it is a polyester nylon fabric it is understandable why it would stain but it does not matter to me I am more impressed with this product compared to  the other bags I have seen here which are overpriced and shoddy. If that is a major issue I would of just paid more and found a leather product substitute.The inside is well regulated and padded so the netbook and accessories will stay safe.

It's also quite long too-Pockets - This provides so many pockets that you can place all your accessories and chargers in and not worry about hurting your device.-Protection - I am so pleased with how well this protects my device. I no longer need to worry about accidentally dropping this or placing something on top of it.Cons:-The logo - You're either going to love or hate having that Amazon logo. I personally think it's kind of cool but I can see how others could dislike having it.-Size - Can be considered big or bulgy if all you were looking for a simple sleeve.Bottom Line:This is an excellent product. There really isn't any better product for this price. It checks off the needs of a case and more. Quality and features are not lost for its low price.

It's also possible to store a few sheets of 8.5 X 11.0 inch paper, although this is pushing it, because you are at the limit of the interior available space.  It differed from the product described on the Amazon site in 2 regards. First, I had been concedrfned about the stated interior width measurement, 0.84.""

Really. I have a lot of respect for fellow Amazon reviewers, but I confess to being just a tad bit skeptical that this little bag could be that good for that low a price. Especially when much more basic sleeves or bags this size are running two to five times the price. But...well, wow!  Yes, the lining fabric is a cheap nylon, but it's sturdy and will do the job. Yes, the stitching may be a little longer (been a long time since I sewed, so...8 stitches to the inch instead of 12? I'm too lazy to measure because it doesn't matter.) The bag is still well made, with sturdy seams, excellent padding--including on the bottom, where even some high-end sleeves and totes really skimp. The layout of the bag with its choice of interior and exterior pockets is far better than any other I've looked at--I can carry my 11"" laptop, my kindle, the charger, a portable surge protector, a smaller spiral notebook, pens, my phone, and some of the miscellaneous junk that always seems to accumulate--and with the options even I can find whatever I'm looking for.  Zippers are good quality heavy duty and the main zip has two pulls so you can open from the center. Zippers go far enough to provide easy access (not always guaranteed even on the more expensive ones I looked at), and there's a baffle under both sides of the main zipper that protects your computer from getting scratched by the zipper.

I bought a small 2 in 1 computer a couple weeks before I bought this bag. I was looking for a way to carry my essentials without having to be burdened down with a huge bag. This was definitely the answer.First let's start with the construction. It is well put together. The bag has three pockets, two exterior on the front and one main for the laptop. Inside the laptop compartment there are 3 dividers. I found that these are great for a small book and a notebook besides your computer. The outside pockets I use for pens or stylus and a portable mouse. The smallest pocket I don't use. The strap is full adjustable and I have found it to be very reliable opposed to some reviewers. When I am carrying my computer it feels well protected and enough has enough padding to take some bumps and bruises without damaging the inside valuables.On to use, I typically am pretty hard on things and I have already caught myself throwing this bag inside my car or in the back. Obviously my computer still functions so it definitely protects my things. I love the fact is small and I can carry it just about anywhere. I've had 2 books a notebook and my computer plus two pens and an optical wireless mouse (may have stretched it just a bit) but it still was able to fit in this tiny bag. This has been a great purchase and I would have no problems purchasing amazon brand in the future.

Therefore, be cautious if using with a lighter notebook, as it may accidentally slip off your shoulder.

Construction quality is good.  Main pocket is roomy enough for a laptop, a couple file folders, notebook and power cord and HDMI cable but not overly bulky.  Larger side pocket hold 2 pens, business cards and has enough space to hold a small notebook.  Smaller side pocket is good for letters or other small items you don't want crushed in the other two pockets.  My only complaint about the bag is that the pad on the shoulder strap that came with it was ridiculously cheap; it's way too stiff to be useful, but because of the incredible price, I couldn't bring myself to deduct a star.  Plus, workaround is super easy:  (a) remove pad or (b) use a different strap.  I opted for (b).  I just took the one from my old Trager bag.

Take a look around at possible protection/carry solutions for your < 12"" tablet/netbook/laptop and you'll find pretty much nothing else that can compete.So this is assuredly a good deal.But how good a deal? That is, how good is this bag?In terms of ergonomics, I'd give it an A: it's JUST big enough to do the job, and not too big. It has three compartments inside--although they're separated by thin plastic dividers. Outside, you have two zippered pockets. The strap this comes with is good enough. The handle is fine.Construction seems OK. The stitching appears a little ""on the cheap"" and I'm not entirely convinced that either a road warrior would want this for full-time travel or that a student would want this bag for day-in-day-out travel to-and-from class. But for the casual user, it seems fine.Now the Achilles heel: Protection. The padding at the bottom of the bag which will keep your tablet/laptop safe in the case where you drop it seems pretty minimal. There is SOME protection, so this isn't worthless in that regard. But they could assuredly have included a bit more cushion at the bottom. I would NOT trust my tablet/laptop to survive a few foot fall in this bag, if you should be unlucky, drop the bag, and have the bag hit near the bottom (and Murphy's law asserts that if you drop the bag, it WILL hit near the bottom). I have more expensive, higher end, bags and they are definitely more satisfactory in this regard.But, provided you don't actually drop the bag from several feet, this bag should be fine for everyday use.On the whole, you're not going to find anything better at anywhere near the price. If you want a bag that can hold your tablet/laptop AND the standard accessories (including a power cord), and you want a deal on that bag, get this. Just be aware that your may be getting more bag for your money than you expected, but you're not getting a BMW/Rolex/YourFavoriteLuxuryBrandHere for a pauper's price.","Excellent ergonomics, excellent price.

The bag I had was much too large and actually weighed more than the computer itself. All I wanted was a bag that would hold the computer, power supply, mouse and and a folder or two of papers. After several trips to the big box and office supply stores, I came up empty. All the bags they had were too large, had too many storage compartments and pockets and were too heavy. To make it worse, the bags I did not like ranged in price from $50 to $150. That's too much to spend for a bag that would not meet my needs.I was looking at bags on Amazon and came across this bag. It appeared to be just what I wanted and at less than $17, the price was right. I was a bit concerned about the quality of the bag at that price, but I decided to order it and give it a try. When the bag arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised. The build quality was excellent and the materials used are top notch.

It's brand new. I can smell the new product feel. Comes in with a super beautiful fit box, that was really neat. The bag itself is wonderful. As I expected from Amazon. Design of the bag is very nice. No extra/ unnecessary space in the bag so it holds the  14' laptop perfectly. Literally fits. Unlike other bags you buy for 14' laptops, they say it's for 14' but there's always that little bag between the bag and where the laptop fits and when you walk or carry it the laptop always bam into the bag empty area because it was not designed accurately. But this, just perfect. It's beautiful. It comes with extra little pockets inside and also outside that you can put your tablet or notebook any other thing you would like to bring along with your laptop. About 7 pockets. Two thin ones inside the bag. One big ones with ziplock on the outside also a medium one with ziplock on the big one. Inside the big zip lock pocket it has three extra tiny pockets you can put your ID cards, cellphone, pencils etc little things to hold in place. Very nicely and neat designed.

The second compartment is large and would be adequate for storing chargers, USB flash drives, and a cell phone. Both of the secondary compartments zip close. The interior of this bag is light grey, it also comes with a shoulder strap.

I can fit a large textbook in it along with the laptop with no problem.  I could use this instead of a backpack if I only have one class that needs a book, or put it in my backpack with other stuff.  My backpack isn't even that large, but this thing is compact even when full.  Would be a great carryon or inside of a larger carryon.  I don't know why it's so affordable, but Amazon could charge a lot more.  Great purchase.  Would definitely buy again if it's stolen.  It won't wear out soon if ever.  The only people that should buy another bag are people obsessed with name brands.  This is top of the line and a designer label can only match the quality, if they even could.

My son's school recently implemented an IPAD program for the students.  The students were to have IPADS to take the place of books...great news...no more heavy books to carry.  One small problem.  Although the IPAD fit in the 10 inch bag I purchased for him to carry from class to class fit the IPAD perfectly, it did not fit the 12. 5 inch keyboard that they ultimately decided to require the students to use.  I searched online for a bag that fit my exacting requirements, since I wanted something durable, black, thickly padded, adjustable strap since my son is very tall, and most bags I looked at did not have this capability to adjust to the appropriate length to be comfortable for him.  I wanted something that zippered securely since I did not want the ipad or keyboard to slide out.  I was BEYOND pleased with this.  This not only fits his IPAD, the keyboard, but his phone, headphones, flash drive and mouse for computer class, writing implements, adapter, TI 84 calculator, a spiral notebook, and stylus.  Best of all, it is padded thickly!  There are 2 large zippered pockets, and one smaller zippered pocket, several varying sized interior organizing pockets which are smartly placed on opposite sides of the bag, giving him a place to store the keyboard and accessories in an organized manner so items can be located quickly.  The zippers seem very durable, and move back and forth easily.  He likes that it is solid black (""looks cooler"" he said!)  We have 4 cats and cat fur does not seem to stick to this bag...which was actually another concern because some bags tend to attract fur.  The material seems sturdy as it almost has a woven texture.  The straps are removable, although I don't see my son planning on removing them, and the strap actually rotates easily to avoid tangling...a feature I did not see on any of the other bags I had considered...a nice surprise!  The strap is thick, but lightweight.  The bag also has two handles if you prefer to just carry it by hand without the strap.  The lining on ours is a medium grey, which he observed makes it easier to find items at a glance.  There is also some reinforced stitching on the front zipper compartment which also gives the bag some character.  He has used the bag for several months and has not had any issues with wear and tear on it.  The 14.1 inch Laptop and Tablet Bag is an amazing price for such a quality item!

My laptop's only a few months old so I'm really careful with it, and I'm confident that this bag will protect it from handling and minor abuse.That said, with all the great reviews of it, I was admittedly somewhat disappointed. I got this bag to replace this bag (http://amzn.to/1qyTujY) which was great and sturdy, but broke at the strap in less than 6 months (I should have heeded the reviewers that warned of that). The reason the other bag broke was because there was too much stress where the strap and bag were connected. This bag solves that by making that connection more of a hinge, so the strap can just move around instead of being stationary and tearing from stress.Except, that connection is really squeaky when it moves around. Like when you're walking. I couldn't find a way around it so I figured that's just how it's going to be.Also, there's a slimmer pocket within the main bag that seems like it was meant to secure the actual laptop so it's not jostled around in the bag, which is a great idea, except that my laptop can barely fit in it, which is concerning because I always thought my laptop was fairly small/thin for a 15.6"" laptop. That said, it fits and does its job; it's just a little annoying to have to fit it carefully into that tight pocket every time.The material of the bag seems pretty cheap too. By cheap, I don't mean flimsy, because I'm sure it can withstand reasonable wear and tear, but it just doesn't have the nicer feel or appearance of other messenger bags.It feels more like a somewhat thicker-than-usual laptop sleeve, though with an extra pocket (which is nice for cables and power bricks) and a shoulder strap.

The zipper work great and the main compartment one starts and ends below the corners so it can really open up.. It's light weight. Love the bag, and it was so inexpensive! My only complaint which earned it a 1 star deduction is that while the bag is tall and wide enough for letter size papers I need to carry sometimes for meetings, the corners on the top are too rounded. Thus all the top corners of my papers get crimped if I want to zip the bag up. If I carry a file folder, I have to leave it unzipped because their tabs are 1/4 inch too tall. Amazon should been thinking about the business person who still has to carry papers sometimes and have made it with squarer corners on top and 1/4 taller for files.

The adapter fits well in the front. The handles are thin and could use padding. The zippers are beefy and feel like they will hold up.I'll be writing a 4 star review for the 11.6"" bag.

They must have changed the design.IMO, if the carrying strap is fastened properly with the hook facing outward (the listing photo and most people hook it backward,) that hook won't become detached without breaking it.  If you are still concerned, get a strap at Goodwill for an old time 10# laptop carrying case.Swing the case by the straps with a 5 pound load inside, or drop it without the laptop properly inserted, and the impact with wall or ground could be substantial.  No soft side case can absorb a point impact.  It has no way to distribute them, so I don't recommend this case for expensive contents or that weighs more than 3 pounds.  A $300 or less Chromebook should be ok.There is 1/2 of padding on the pocket side and 1/4 over the rest of the case. Insert a laptop hinge side first with the display side facing the front. Put the laptop in the center section of the largest compartment and there's room to insert a magazine or paper pad on either side for more impact resistance. A child could fit homework in those side sections.I'm happy with what I got today,  but will amend this review if anything changes after a few months of abuse.Here's a comparison of the plastic hook, one from an old $120 Dell Laptop case, and one from a new $85 messenger bag.",Perfect for my Acer R11 and its accessories.,Size: 11.6 InchStyle: 1-packConfiguration: BagVerified Purchase,44 people found this helpful

The laptop bag has two interior pockets and two exterior pockets. These provide for ample storage space. I carry my laptop, charger, and wireless mouse with ease.

What happens is that the clip hook doesn't always swivel freely, especially if the strap has twisted itself across the side of the bag. When you lift it up, the clip doesn't swivel and all the weight of the bag deflects the flexible part of the clip sideways, out of the hook body and the hook pops off of the bail. I think the only way to fix this would be with a metal clip body. You can avoid this if you wiggle the strap a bit before you pick up the bag to make sure the strap extends straight up and the clips aren't jacked sideways.A smaller issue is that the length of the strap material is such that the adjustment slider is in the exact spot you would want the should pad to be when set to the average person's size.The Good:This is a really nice bag for $14. I got the 11"" version and it feels durable and well padded. The padding seems fine for the weight of a typical 11"" Chromebook but I suspect there is too little in the corners for larger, heavier laptops. The zippers seem tough and the straps are well sewn and durable. The pockets are nice though it's too bad the pocket that has the sleeves for a wallet, pens, etc. is also the only pocket big enough for a power supply. So you can't easily get at your pens, etc. if the power supply is in there. All in all, a really nice bag.

Not just with the padding of the front and back coming together (as with comparably priced bag). No, this bag has significant padding (perhaps 1/3 or 1/3 inch thick) across the nearly two inches of the bottom of the case. This makes the case vastly more protective when setting it down (or, heaven forfend, dropping it).Con: As many have remarked, the entire strap mechanism, including the clips and rings, is plastic. It seems like good plastic, but it's still plastic. How long until it fails? Who knows. One thing, though: on my last bag, it wasn't the strap that failed but the nylon loop on which it fastened.

The 11.6-inch version of this bag has 2 pockets in the storage compartment, not the 3 as pictured in the stock photos (with the pens, pencils, etc). Many have described their bags as having an orange interior, which in my case is false since I have grey (or I've received a lower quality product, just something to note). This may also be due to the fact that Amazon clumps all these reviews across different product types together. The bag has just enough room for the laptop, power adapter and maybe a cell phone, which is enough, so don't expect to fit much else in the storage compartment as you'll be cramped for space and things will start getting bulky. Finally, one smaller zipper compartment on the front, which can store something like a USB drive or notes without sacrificing any additional space.In my opinion, this bag feels like it was made out of cheaper synthetic materials, but it's put together in a way that I feel will last; if that makes any sense. The zippers are metal, but the latches for the shoulder strap are completely plastic moulded. The outer materials aren't that bad, but the inside could use better and softer padding.
