A small gym bag to carry a change of clothes and all my trinkets…. wrist wraps etc and even a 36” tricep rope. I hate people that don’t specify what they got, so I ordered the XSMALL. I wanted the smallest bag to carry around but still have plenty of room. And this nailed it. Super good amount of space for the size, and plenty sturdy. I carry it with me my entire workout station to station so I needed something compact. I’m also not a moron and did some research beyond the one picture on this listing. People said the bag they ordered didn’t have clips for the strap or a very front zipper on the front pocket. Well that’s because u ordered a S OR XS. It’s not hard to do a tad bit of research folks. If u go to the under armour site I’ll see that the S and XS have slightly different features. It has a front pocket but no small zipper on the outside of that pocket. And the straps r connected on both, the removable straps r only on M and up. I specifically got the XS cause I don’t care lol. I’m just using it as a gym bag so having the attached strap is perfect. Plenty of room even in the XS, front pocket is just an open compartment (no cell phone divider or anything like that). The shoe compartment is great , I use that for my towel and dirty clothes and more smelly items as it has a vent for air.

It fits a large, adult sized throw blanket, a small pillow , a couple pairs of clothes, a pair of size 10 men’s shoes, and a toiletry bag and still leaves a lot of room left. You could probably fit a week or two weeks worth of clothes in it.There’s a shoe pocket on one side which I think is so cool so you can separate shoes from all the other things you want to put in it. It has a small pocket inside of it, big enough to fit a wallet or phone, etc. , a front zipper pocket that you can fit small items In, plus another pocket on the opposite side of the shoe pocket that you can fit a couple of full sized shampoo bottles In (just to give you an idea of size) .

My only gripe is maybe have an even smaller version available as this actually has a lot of unused space for how I use it. I just go from my house to the gym and I am dressed for a workout already when I go. If you take a bag to the office and need all your workout gear and clothes in the bag this may suit you.

Plus extra workout gear like bands, water bottle, foam roller, etc.After looking at the reviews, I decided to go with a medium. Based on the pictures I thought that would be a reasonable size.I was wrong. This is massive. I can literally fit myself into the medium size bag. An entire body in one bag (hopefully there are no crazy axe murderers reading this review). Guys, I'm not kidding, I put my entire bathroom and 2 extra outfits in this bag and I still have so much room.So the space is great. But carrying it? Not great. The bag is freaking giant, I can't stress this enough. Its not uncomfortable to carry but just be aware this is much larger than you think. If you're like me and just wanna fit your ridiculous 10 step beauty routine, you probably just need a small. If you're someone who packs his own home gym into his gym bag to bring to the gym?

People said the bag they ordered didn’t have clips for the strap or a very front zipper on the front pocket. Well that’s because u ordered a S OR XS. It’s not hard to do a tad bit of research folks. If u go to the under armour site I’ll see that the S and XS have slightly different features. It has a front pocket but no small zipper on the outside of that pocket. And the straps r connected on both, the removable straps r only on M and up. I specifically got the XS cause I don’t care lol. I’m just using it as a gym bag so having the attached strap is perfect.

I was concerned that the pad at least might be missing as some complained about that.The bag seems to be pretty durable and should stand up to the test. I thoroughly examined the zippers as those are the first to fail on bags over time. No concerns to note there.The medium is big. From the comments I was not sure if I should be expecting a Santa sized bag. It’s definitely Bigger than “normal” medium sized bag but still tolerable for me. I’d say their medium is a large for a lot of other brands,  but in terms of large it’s on the lower size end. Just be sure to read the bag dimensions rather than relying on size.One note which I was aware of so I can’t dock the item is that it’s low on pockets. You only have the main compartment with the tiny sock style pocket in it (useless), a wet compartment, and two zip pockets on the external.For such a big bag there isn’t anything to offer for organizaron. If you have lots of loose bits and pieces this may be a problem for you.Edit: still a great bag but I moved on to another with more pockets.

Not sure where the removable straps are, seeing as I searched all UA bags and didn't see this feature even in previous versions. I am not sure yet if I will return it, but did think it was a decent enough discrepancy to share because it does take away from the value of this bag as well as how comfortable it is to carry around with decent weight in it. Also, I think it's worth mentioning that I wear size 8 women's shoes and I had to cram them to fit in the shoe storage pocket. I realize the bag is XS, but still it was a tight fit so really don't think any larger shoes or men's shoes would fit very well.
