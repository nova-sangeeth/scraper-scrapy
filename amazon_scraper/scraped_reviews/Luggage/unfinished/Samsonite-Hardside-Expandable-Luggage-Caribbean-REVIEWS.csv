It was the first hard case that I've bought.  For the most part, I am satisfied, but I wish I had known a couple more bits of information before I purchased.  If you are also buying YOUR FIRST HARD CASE, read these IMPORTANT TIPS.  TIP #1: This case closes with a ZIPPER ONLY.  It does not have a latch.  Zipper-only hard cases are more vulnerable to malfunction because zippers can break or split apart with stress or excessive wear.  If the zipper splits on this case, you do will have a latch as a backup method to keep your case closed and you may find your self in a predicament when you need to check your broken-zippered bag at the airport.  Therefore, if you buy this case, be sure to also buy luggage straps.  Luggage straps are extremely effective to keep your case closed and will help prevent excessive stress or damage to the zipper.  When buying luggage straps, write your initials on each strap with a permanent marker.  This will not only help identify your bag in a busy airport, but also make the straps less desirable for thieves.  TIP #2: I bought the (very large) 28-inch version of this case because I wanted to have plenty of space to pack for long international trips.  In hindsight, I wish I had bought a size or two smaller because filling up a case this big with normal items like clothing, shoes, and toiletries will almost always put you over the airline weight limits (and be very heavy to lift).  The case is very light, but I can only fill it up about 75% to avoid paying the ""excess weight"" fees.  With the case being 25% empty, I have lots of open space in the bag and my belongings bounce around inside.  When I arrive at my destination, I often find my loosely packed belongings out of order and disheveled.  For my next suitcase, I will buy something a tad bit smaller so I can fill 90% or 100%.  When filled to 90-100%, my belongings would be tightly packed and more secure inside.","Great Product, but read this IMPORTANT ADVICE if shopping for your first hard suitcase",Size: Checked-Large 28-InchColor: BlackVerified Purchase,"3,475 people found this helpful"

In the last couple years it began to show it's age, but it wasn't until the handle finally ripped off and the inner lining tore a small hole on my most recent trip that I admitted it was finally time to move on.My initial inclination was to buy something cheap - I don't need fancy luggage, I got student loans to pay... So I was poking around and looking at options in the $30 - $40 market, and there were some that looked ok. But then I would dig into the reviews and read about them breaking on the first trip, or having stuck wheels or finicky handles... Not feeling satisfied I put off the purchase for a while. I went to a store and looked at some of these models in person, and I was startled by how flimsy they felt in person. They were not built to handle the abuse of transatlantic air-travel. Feeling ambivalent, I put off the decision yet again.Fast forward to Tuesday of this week, no suitcase purchased, my flight is Friday morning. I pull my old trusty carry-on out of storage and seriously debate taking it on one last journey... just one more time?? The suitcase does not want. So I come back to Amazon and search again until I find this suitcase. It's not super cheap, but it's not expensive either, and it has a great color, and good reviews, and it sturdy in the photos... I'm still undecided, but, well, clock is ticking, I bite the bullet.Suitcase arrived just in time for my flight :-) My roommate carried the box upstairs for me this afternoon and when I thanked her, commented on how light it was. As soon as I open it I am relieved, this is a strong and sturdy suitcase, and it looks smart. The handle is long, and slides out easily, doesn't rattle around like those other flimsier models did. Wheels are seemingly good quality. The body looks quite durable and scratch resistant, the zipper is good quality, oh and there's even a lock. It holds a lot of stuff for how small it is, and it is expandable which is helpful for people who sometimes overpack.UPDATE: Suitcase held up perfectly over 4 four flights over the holidays, on two of which it actually had to be checked because the flight was very full. Not a single scratch or dent, no signs of wear, and it was easy to travel with - rolled smoothly and easily, sturdy handle.","Smart suitcase, looks like it is built to last",Size: Carry-On 20-InchColor: Caribbean BlueVerified Purchase,"1,057 people found this helpful"

Just spent nearly a month touring Europe with this set.  We flew to Paris from Chicago.  Then we flew from Paris to Madrid and then from Madrid to Rome.  Then we took trains all over Italy, a cruise throughout Greece and some other stops in Monaco and France.  We carried not only enough clothes for a long trip but we also got married in the Greek Islands so we also had a wedding gown and tux in here as well.  To say that our luggage needed to be spacious, easily maneuverable, and strong enough to bear up to that much travel without wrecking our clothes is an understatement.  We chose Samsonite as my previous set was 16 years old and still going strong.  To see how the all wheel luggage performed we went to a nearby Samsonite store.  The ultra lite series seemed entirely too flimsy for our needs and we decided on this set.  I read all the reviews online and, despite being concerned about the one review I saw about the large bag being beyond regulation size, I ordered this set.  Now on the other side of our trip I can tell you not once did any airline mention the bag's total dimensions (to be honest I've never seen an airline baggage handler with a tape measure and really think they only care if it makes weight) and how many times we discussed during the trip how great this luggage set had performed.  We planned at the start that we would pack without unzipping the 2"" extensions to start and would know we had bought enough souvenirs once all three bags had been extended.  It all worked exactly as planned.  The bags were sturdy and well balanced.  We were easily able to put our backpacks and carryon bags on top of these and not need to keep a hold of them to keep them from tipping.  We did get one scratch on the large bag but it is not really noticeable.

I traveled to London, Brussels, Munich, back to Brussels, Paris, Rome, Florence, Venice, back to London, Bristol, Bath, London again before returning to LA in a matter of a few weeks. I traveled by plane (checked baggage), train, bus, Uber’s, subway, and on foot. I can proudly say this suitcase is tuff as nails. I really pushed it past it’s limit and then some. It’s survived gravel, cobblestone roads, and even being dragged up and down stairs by the handle (I know, I know, you’re not SUPPOSED to do that) and it survived without a scratch on the suitcase itself. Which wouldn’t bother me anyway. They’re like a sign of being well travelled, but I digress. The wheels are scratched up, but that’s about it. Lastly, towards the middle through the end of my trip, I tied a duffle bag with a luggage bungee cord (also purchased on Amazon) which just added more weight. The suitcase did not fall over. I highly recommend these suitcases! It’s a great investment.——These just arrived so I’ll update my review after my upcoming trip to Europe. Let me preface this review by saying I’ve only owned the old fashioned fabric suitcases with wheels. My motivation for ordering a more hard shell set of suit cases was for some type of protection against the rain. My last two trips to Central America and Europe were not great. On several occasions my fabric suit cases got soaked in the rain and so did all my stuff.Any who, I did a lot of research before picking this set. I was leaning towards the Amazon brand because I can be cheap, but these had such great reviews. I figured the extra bucks were worth it. I wanted the Caribbean Blue so bad. It looks gorgeous in the photos! But I’m cheap so I ordered black. Still gorgeous.It rolls fine even on carpet so I expect it will survive cobblestone roads. The hard shell case looks protective, but then again I understand it not impenetrable. I expect it will likely get scratches, but that’s the price you pay for frequent travel.I had read other reviews about some annoying plastic on each suitcase. Either it varies by seller or perhaps several sellers have now listened and made changes. Unpacking was simple. It arrived as expected and on time. Each individual suit case was simply wrapped in a plastic bag, similar to a dry cleaners. Then they were stacked into each other similar to Russian dolls. It arrived in one box.My only complaint is there were no instructions for setting up the locks. I had to search for a video on YouTube. I went ahead and posted a video with my review. Hopefully it’s helpful!Thankfully, I have yet to have an issue with getting my luggage mixed up at the carousel so that’s not a concern even now. But I’ll still secretly thing of the Caribbean Blue I was too cheap to pay for.I purchased these for an upcoming trip to Europe later this month so I’ll definitely provide an update once I’m back in October.",Great Price for Great Brand,Size: 3-Piece Set (20/24/28)Color: BlackVerified Purchase,44 people found this helpful

Each size holds a lot especially if you're a strategic packer. I even was able to take a trip with just the smallest size for one month spent in three climates.Cons: I take 100-150+ flights a year but can count on one hand the amount of times I check a bag. That being said, the physical damage my carry-on has endured despite never checking it is very surprising especially given my set is less than a year old. Two of the wheels are now damaged, one of which barely spins anymore, so it's become very difficult to push or pull the suitcase. Lastly, the handles are very shaky and fragile. I really regret not investing a bit more in a Tumi or Rimowa instead.Conclusion: if you're looking for an attractive but inexpensive luggage set to use for your infrequent vacations, this set should be ok.

The teal colour is very nice blue/green blend, pretty close to what you see in Amazon's pic, not on the Samsonite page.  The color on the Samsonite page isn't as accurate, looks a lot darker than it actually is.  The large suitcase is just that, LARGE!  Easy to get overweight with that one pretty quickly and it's pretty tough to lift with the size and weight if you fill it up.  Surface is also very slippery, which doesn't help with lifting - your hands will just slide off if you're trying to stabilize it from the side or underneath.  Handles are a bit too small for the large suitcase, could have used something a bit more substantial.  Large suitcase on its own weighs around 10.35 lbs (according to Samsonite website. 10.5 according to my fishing scale), medium is 8.3, small one is 6.8lbs.  Quite a bit lighter than our old fabric suitcases.  The medium suitcase is a great intermediate size, I'll be using that one a lot.  Haven't used the small one, but we did see them being used as carry on during a couple of flights.Wheels roll really easily.  We'll see how they last.They are also getting popular.

It's hard to decide but i went with Samsonite Omni because i already had the carry on (only realized this as i was researching) and also because it was the lightest one in the reviews at 8lbs.  This means more weight for packing!  The handle and wheels work great on the carry on size, and so far, in my house, the same goes for the 24"".  I have checked my carry on size previously and it held up well with the luggage loading/unloading and abuse behind the scenes so I'm assuming the Omni 24"" will survive likewise.This case has an expandable zipper and the only downside to this bag (which i imagine might be the case for any  larger sized, hardside, clamshell case that expands) is that if it's heavy, you may have some wiggle between the sides as you maneuver on uneven pavement, or if you're lifting it.  There isn't a handle on the bottom, which is also not great.  But otherwise, the case fits enough clothes for a three week trip (if you're not a diva and packing 15 pairs of shoes, lol).  I generally bring 2-3 pairs of shoes (wearing my biggest shoes on the travel days) and will wash clothes when i travel that long.

I researched many suitcases for a 2 week trip to Europe this summer and ultimately decided on this case (that was also purchased with the 20"" case that was not brought to Europe).It held up extremely well through 3 flights, many walks through the streets from train station to hotel, and on a few train rides.  You can tell there are little ""scratches"" or marks where something hit it, but no major discoloration or punctures (to date).  There is a ton of room and if you need a little more it has the expanding zipper.  The wheels were a large concern of mine since that was the reason for my new suitcase purchase, old cheap suitcase where the wheels fell out of shape.  The fact that this has 4 360' spinning wheels is great when you need to drag it behind you on 2 wheels or guide it easily though a flat surface (train station or airport) with all 4 wheels down and the handle has different levels for whether or not you're using 2 or 4 wheels.The 24"" suitcase has 2 handles, one on top and 1 on the side.  They have some give which is nice, but I think I will always worry about them snapping since the suitcase, when full, can weigh a lot.  I had it around 36 lbs for my international flights and 33 for domestic and they have not broken, so neither I or the airlines have managed to break them despite the weight and the airlines typical lack of ""handle with care"" for suitcases.When opened, the right half has 2 elastic straps to help keep things in place and from shifting around and the left half has the mesh zipper that keeps the stuff on that side from falling out when opening the suitcase.  There is even a long skinny zipper pouch to put smaller stuff, receipts, etc. inside.  The suitcase itself is extremely lightweight and does not add much weight at all, if you're concerned about potentially going over the 50 lbs limit.I would highly recommend this suitcase and plan on having it for many years.

I was surprised at how light this suitcase is and also, being so big, easy to handle.  I was able to fit everything I needed and still had plenty of room without having to expand it.  I feel that if you expand such a big suitcase, it may become less stable and harder to move around.  Keep in mind that these wonderful spinner wheels are made to run smoothly only on airport surfaces - no rugs, or sidewalks.  I had a slightly more difficult time rolling it from the parking lot to the terminal as the road surfaces are rougher and less even.  Aside from that, it makes a world of a difference to use a spinner rather than the traditional 2 wheeled suitcases.  I own a fabric Travel Pro set that is in very good shape and I have used for many years but it has 2 wheels and it is much heavier - so time to upgrade.  I am happy with  my purchase.  As far as the dimensions, I don't know who took them - I was worried that the 29 inch would be too big and I would have to pay over size charges but NOPE.  I  measured it right out of the box and the overall dimensions including the wheels was 61 inches (length + width + height) which is under the 62"" maximum required by the airlines.  I packed stuff for 8 days and even though I was allowed 70 lb. in my checked baggage, I was only at 62 lbs.  The weight of the suitcase itself is a big help.  I did see a few superficial scratches on it, only after the first trip, but it is to be expected.  I am not worried about scratches - they are inevitable - in my opinion.  So with that said, I will most likely end up buying another set for my husband.  The carryon is also the perfect size and I was pleasantly surprised at how much stuff I can fit in it.  I used to to stuff all the heavy goodies I bought abroad, including liquids, and I checked it as a regular bag.  The medium 25"" is a good size - no so medium - more like a large suitcase but I have not used it yet.  I believe the 25"" is most likely going to be my clothing suitcase and the larger one will be the everything else and souvenir b ag - as it holds tons of stuff.

The 28"" Omni PC Hardside had a wheel failure before I even completed my first flight to Greece.  The luggage was great (distinctive color and scratch resistant exterior) but the wheels were not.  The rubber part just peeled off the wheel, making the whole thing almost unusable.  Spent the next 5 weeks of my vacation carrying a 50lb suitcase because it wouldn't roll.  I did effect a repair using some epoxy that I purchased from an auto store in Albania, and it held, but it wasn't a perfect repair.  I've submitted a warranty complaint to Samsonite and I have yet to hear back.  Learn from my mistake.  Whatever suitcase that you buy, make sure they have good wheels, preferably ones that look like rollerblade wheels I'm guessing.  Having a two piece wheel, rubber glued on to plastic, seems like a cheap failure point.  Rollerblade wheels are one piece are meant to take abuse and are readily replaceable.  The wheels on my luggage are not.  Also, if you have spinner wheels, make sure that you only roll your luggage in the upright, vertical position.  Pulling spinner luggage at an angle, like traditional luggage, may have accelerated my bag's wheel failure.  Just a thought for those of you that are new to spinner wheel luggage.  Also, in the future, I will try to travel with a spare wheel for my big bag, because a wheel failure on a 50 lb bag of luggage is not an option.  Update:  Have spent weeks trying to get Samsonite to respond to my wheel failure.  This is the worst company in the world.

It only has minor scuff marks to the bottom surface where it scraped against rough concrete. The wheels work well, and spin in all directions easily. Both handles are heavily used and still intact. The telescoping handle works smoothly and makes life easy.I find this size (20”) works very well for me for a week long trip. I typically pack the following: a week’s worth of underclothes, a pair of pjs, 1-2 pair of shoes (usually flats or sandals), 4-6 outfits, maybe some accessories and two large toiletry bags that have everything else in them. In the warmer months I don’t usually have to use the expander function, but in the warmer months with bulkier clothes, I do.I have the purple color, which is nice and subtle, since these are mostly professional trips.

The locking mechanism is really nice and easy to use! I also love how lightweight it is, and how much space is inside. I can easily lift and maneuver it with one hand and still have a hand free.  It also has a little zipper compartment on the inside that is great for smaller items, like keys or medication. It's held up super well and will continue to hold up it seems. It's showing very few signs of wear or tear, even after two long trips with a lot of flights and handling.Cons: There is no handle on the side, so it makes it kind of difficult to load an unload from trunks or overhead bins, or to pick it up from a baggage carousel in case it has to get checked. The wheels also aren't as great as I would've hoped. They sometimes catch or get stuck when I'm rolling sideways. It's very minor, but still can be annoying when I'm in a hurry at the airport.Overall, I'm super pleased at the quality and value! I also love the dark blue color so much.

I took it on six air flight segments, three trains, and four car rides, so it did get a good work out being loaded and unloaded several times. One thing I noticed on the train was that when you put this in the luggage compartment, like all bags with these spinner wheels, it would slip out unless there was a lip on the bottom of the compartment. On the Leonardo Express from Rome's airport to the Termini station, for example, a couple of turns resulted in this heavier bag pushing out two other carry on bags into the aisle. Solution: Lay it flat if there is no barrier to it rolling out.It held a deceptively large amount of clothes and other items (gifts, toiletry bag, electronic cables, documents, etc.) without the need for expansion. I used compression bags (the ones where you press out the air) for 14 days worth of shirts, underwear, and socks, and also was able to pack two pairs of pants, an extra pair of shoes, a rain jacket, two t-shirts, and a pair of casual pants, as well as the other items listed above. It met the check-in weight requirements of European airlines easily.The locking mechanism was excellent and easy to use. The only time my bag was opened was when I landed back in the US and it was unlocked when I retrieved it. Interestingly, when TSA used their key to open the bag, it reset the combination to show the code I used; I just didn't expect that to happen.The only complaint I have is with how this bag performed on less than smooth flat surfaces. Taking the bag across paved roads and on the sidewalk was fine; however, cobble stone streets, any rough surfaces (even slightly rough), and carpeted hallways were more difficult to negotiate; I had to tilt the bag and drag it, instead of having it upright on all four wheel sets. My carry-on bag, in contrast, had no problem so it was either how this bag's wheels were configured or the extra weight that made it more challenging. This was all more of an inconvenience than a major issue with the bag.","Strong bag, some issues on uneven ground",Size: Checked-Medium 24-InchColor: TealVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I wanted to make sure we didn't have something that would break, or look like garbage after 1 trip. These fit the bill. We bought the 3 piece set, and a single medium sized one. We ended up only using the 3 piece set for a one week trip for our family of 4. They pulled the airport just fine, a little struggle on thicker carpets in the hotel, but that's what luggage carts are for.I will say this about the large one. If you're flying with it, it is almost impossible to pack at less than 65lbs. Maybe fill half of it with your favorite pillow? IDK. Our flight had a max of 70lb on the suitcases, so it wasn't an issue, but I know regular flights don't have that high of a weight limit without paying more. It's just very large!All the cases are very sturdy, surprisingly lightweight, and the textured exterior helps hide the inevitable scuff marks from baggage handling.After researching alot on these, I now understand that, especially if it's packed heavy, you should leave them on 4 wheels. Towing them on a tilt on 2 wheels is obviously faster, but I can see where that might be bad on those wheels in a parking lot. We have 2 little kids, so moving fast through the airport wasn't a reality anyway. Once you realize that speed is not an option, they push on 4 wheels surprisingly smooth and freely. A faster walking pace than my wife and 4 year old were comfortable with was easily achievable.",As good I had hoped,Size: 3-Piece Set (20/24/28)Color: Caribbean BlueVerified Purchase,

Minor scuffs on the wheels (which i would expect) but there's not a mark anywhere on the luggage itself.  All zippers seem smooth as well.  Early impressions are:  1)  The set is very light.

While packing i had my clothes piled up and thought, ""no way this is all gonna fit in there"".

I bought the color ""teal"" and it is more subtle (which i like) than in the photo online. Just enough to stand out from the similar style luggage on the airline connveyor belt without being too eye catching!After three months of travel by airline, boat, taxi, bus, bicycle taxi and cobbled streets, the exterior finish still looks great. The wheels did get less responsive as time went by, which made the case harder to steer, but I had a 50lb load so i am sure that was putting a strain on the wheelsl.The handle also got a little looser over time but never felt like it was going to fail.The interior is in great shape and the design of the interior works well once you get used to it.As with all suitcases of this style, remember to factor in the weight of the case itself.The locking system worked when i left for my trip. When i first collected my bag at my initial destination i found my case had been opened when i left the USA and the TSA had not reset the lock, so the case was not locked for the rest of the trip AND i could not lock it when i did receive it.

I didn't foresee the issue of using them in small hotel rooms. This is the first clamshell style suitcase I've used and I wasn't impressed. Maybe other people are used to this style of suitcase but I found it to be a huge pain. Since you pack both side of the suitcase, as opposed to filling just one side, it has to lay open completely flat in order to access everything. Some hotel rooms we stayed in didn't have enough floor space to lay the suitcases out open. We had to lay them out on the bed, get out what we needed, zip them up and set them off to the side to inevitably need something else out of the bag and have to repeat the process all over again. Luggage racks don't work either because again the bag has to lay completely flat in order for you to open it or you risk everything in the top compartment falling out. As was the case multiple times when we realized we needed something out of the suitcase when it was in the trunk of the car and tried to get into the bag. We were constantly repacking and reorganizing these things.Also, there's no handle on the bottom of the bag. This drove my husband crazy when we were loading/unloading the bags during our road trip. Another negative is the lack of pockets. I was aware of this when I bought the bags. I didn't think it would bother me so much but it did! Even with packing cubes I was lacking the storage for small miscellaneous items or a place to put shoes. There is one zipper pocket on the inside that is so small and a pain to get to that I never even bothered using it. We bought these to upgrade a set that is 15 years old with wheels that are wearing out. I'd rather go back to using the old suitcases (thank goodness I didn't get rid of them) rather than travel with these again. Bummer I'm past my return date or else these would definitely be going back.",Not great to use in small places,Size: 3-Piece Set (20/24/28)Color: SilverVerified Purchase,

Besides the slide-up handle there is a handle at top and top-side (none at bottom). All three cases nest together (you can pack one inside the next larger one, which is how they are shipped and arrived). They are very light-weight and very flexible, not rigid (which may lead to transference of impact energy into interior, so I would be careful about packing breakables in them without surrounding padding). They have a material closure around the zippers, in other words, they don't close plastic to plastic, so anyone could stick a knife into the soft zipper material and separate the top from bottom very quickly.

The bags arrived promptly and were very well packed. They are beautiful, roomy, light and sturdy. I also ordered a set of luggage belts because I was traveling to China and I wanted to make sure that my lugagge didn't arrive with my clothes falling out(I had read some horror stories about that). So, when I checked in my lugagge I was very worried about how the bags were going to hold. To my amazement they arrived unscathed and the belts were still holding to the bags(I had read some bad reviews about those, as well). From China I traveled to Indonesia and although I only took the carry on. I was very happy to see that it performed very well during that trip also. The spinner wheels made it through bricks, and cobblestone sidewalks in China without any problems. Back at home I checked the bags for damages but I could only find a few scuffs. I used a wet washcloth to wipe any dirt they had before storing. I placed a small cedar disk inside to keep them smelling fresh. The pictures show the before(with belts) and after the trip(ready to store) bags. You can hardly tell the difference. Why 4 stars? Because the carry on needs a handle on the side. It will make it a lot easier when placing it in the overhead bin and when carrying it up and down stairs. Also, the zippered net insiside would be better if it had compartments or smaller bags to put underwear or small items in. I have seen both the handle on the side of the carry on and the zippered net with bags in other brands. So I know that Samsonite could add it to their bags as well. Also, the locks look weak, although they held very well this time. Overall, the bags are great and beautiful.

I purchased the 24"" in purple which is a little out of character for myself as I prefer everything black, but the color is really sharp and stands out in the sea of black luggage at the bag pickup. The outside casing is a textured plastic which appears to be pretty rugged - I've only taken it on the one trip so far but I did witness a rather hard impact onto other luggage on the baggage carousel.

It held up very well for a recent trip abroad -- lugging it on planes and trains. It's a hard case luggage set that has some give/flexibility -- so it's not 100% hard case. Because of that, I think that's why they're able to make it lightweight and at the price point currently listed. No major scratches, dents, etc. as some other reviewer experienced.

The wheels feel like they are strained under the friction of weight when the bag rolls and the wheels do not glide the way my old suitcase used to, even when on hard surfaces. I found myself lowering the height of the handle to try to counteract the bag’s tipsy-ness, but the tipping situation did not improve. Perhaps I’m just spoiled from my last Rimowa suitcase?

There was a lot of salt/snowmelt on the ground and the large grains of this can get caught in the wheel mechanism and ""lock up"" the wheels so it may be easier to just carry the suitcase in these situations.A minus is the lack of a side handle, which would make it much easier to pick the suitcase up and put it in the overhead bins on airplanes and trains.","Carry-on Suitcase, Convenient Use & Good Size",Size: Carry-On 20-InchColor: BlackVerified Purchase,

If you’ve ever been to Nantucket then you’ll know about the cobblestoned streets, which if I didn’t know better, would say are from the dark ages.The sidewalks are made of brick. This place is gorgeous and super fun, but terrible on wheels.The rollers on this suitcase did over a mile on cobbled roads and brick sidewalks, and still roll as smooth as silk over even ground.Esthetically, I think it looks very good. The material hides scratches well, and the lightweight material handled any/every dent thrown at it...they just pop back out on their own.I had no problems with the zippers, which were very smooth while opening/closing the suitcase from an upright or lied down position.
