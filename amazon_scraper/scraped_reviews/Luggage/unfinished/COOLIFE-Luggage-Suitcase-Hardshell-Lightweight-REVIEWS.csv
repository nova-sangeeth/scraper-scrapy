We just recently made the transition to hard sided suitcases. I really like them because they protect your things but they are obviously not as flexible as soft sided suitcases. I’ve had an issue with other hard cases getting scratched on conveyor belt at the airport but it does not seem like we had that issue with these. The best feature about it is that the zippers become a TSA lock with your own combination that TSA could still access without cutting open your suitcase. I do wish that there was two zipper compartments in each of the suitcases instead of one. I believe that would’ve helped keep the suitcase better organized and prevent it from moving around.,Watch video for commentary 🎥,Color: family set-blue1Verified Purchase,15 people found this helpful

It took me a while to upgrade to 3 stars.I changed my star rating because I appreciate after-sales customer service: their response to my dissatisfaction (someone care to respond!!!).However, I was overseas when they reached out to me (traveling with this broken lousy luggage) so what they offered was not feasible. As I was on a 2-month trip, I had no choice but to buy new luggage to replace this broken one which cost me a fortune since I had no luxury to shop online / no amazon and was at the mercy to get what I could land my hands on.The seller kept reaching out to me to change my review and I replied BUT when they don't reply to my email, and kept re-sending me emails to request me to change my rating, I realized the emails I received from the very beginning are all automated ones. There is probably some sort of algorithm that get these auto mailers out to those who flagged low rating on their products.  I hope fellow consumers will not take advantage of the seller with my exposure of their operations because it is afterall a legit way for them to respond to customers with defective products but in my case, it was unique and they weren't able to recognize that since it was a mechanized process.

Amazon has scrubbed (removed fake reviews) many of the more obvious fake reviews. Every piece of this luggage has ripped and torn outer shells after one domestic flight. There is a luggage store at Columbia mall and I brought the least damaged piece to them for an opinion and the owner and I tore it apart to see what it was made of. We found cardboard, we found staples, we found glue-gun glue, we found twist-ties. It is well past my 30 day window to return this. I feel stupid thatI was deceived by the the seller/manufacturer of this luggage who clearly is padding the reviews with fake reviews.

Purchased in Sept. 2019 and it appears you only have a month to return if not satisfied. That is a red flag. If only I would have read that before, I more than likely would have went with something else. The first trip I used the large suitcase, had it locked and TSA decided to be mosey and pop the lock to search my bag. Turns out, once the lock is popped, it’s done and you can’t ever lock it again. Second trip the medium suitcase came off the baggage carousel smashed and scratched up. Sure, I can pop the dents back in but now the shell is weakened so if it gets dented again, it will likely end up cracking in transit and could expose the contents. Super disappointed in this brand but more than anything, I’m disappointed in Amazon for allowing sellers of crap. It does maneuver fairly well and it is lighter weight than most but none of that matters of the shell is fragile. Yes, I admit I didn’t pay a lot for the set but come on!

Not super light, but pretty solid build quality.  We went with the blue color with no regrets.  Coloring has held up and they aren't scuffing too bad.  The coloring of the cases will come off if you scratch them against something, but the suitcase doesn't lose color, just some of the surface plastic scrapes off.Zippers feel decently solid, but we haven't put them in any extreme conditions to know how solid.  These are mostly used for road trips where we handle our own luggage, so no clue how they would hold up to airlines throwing them around.  I love having multiple sizes to choose from and we most frequently use the middle 2 sizes.  The smallest suitcase is too small for much more than a day trip, but the 2 medium sizes last me for most long weekend or short week trips with no issues(including a couple pairs of shoes in the case and some camera equipment).  For a couple, the largest 3 would probably suit most of your needs for a week, unless you pack super heavy.I would definitely recommend them and the wheels have not given us any issues yet.  It's nice that the wheels are casters that roll in all directions on all 4 corners so you don't have to tilt the case to move them, but that also means if you are on an incline you need to lay them on their sides so they don't roll away.  All things have ups and downs, but ultimately my appreciation for the casters outweighs any inconvenience.Over all, I'd say these are a great buy and we haven't really seen any significant down sides to the set.  We've had them for almost 2 years and while we aren't frequent travelers, they've seen their share of somewhat rugged trips going to Rally Cross events as well as a few trips visiting family.

At every step of the way (e.g., choosing my luggage, as I chose the second option; notifying me when my luggage was shipped my apartment building; etc.), customer service had been in contact with me to check in and to let me know what was going on, both via email and voicemail. The company truly wants to make sure that their customers are satisfied with their product. I finally unboxed my replaced luggage, and it looks beautiful - it's decently lightweight and maneuvers well.

Everything I say below applies to all three pieces of my luggage unless specified otherwise (I also interchangeably use the words ""luggage"" and ""suitcase""):- The 360-wheels feel so nice! I went to Europe last summer and used a suitcase that only had two wheels (the kind you basically had to drag) and I definitely could have used a 360-wheeled suitcase, as I also had a very large instrument (baritone saxophone) to lug around.- I had no issue with the lock or resetting the code. The tool I used is the little pin the workers at the phone store use to get the Sim card out of an iPhone.- The color I bought was Navy and it looks exactly how it does in the picture.- I can't truly comment on it's durability as I have yet to use it in an airport setting but from what I can see and feel, it seems durable for the most part. I can push down on the exterior of the case so I hope that when I can actually test it out, it holds nicely.- The lining of the zipper is a little wonky but it doesn't affect the final product, as it kind zip the pieces of luggage with ease. It's more of an aesthetic thing, but it doesn't bother me.- The handles are all good. For the handle that you pull up, it works fine for the most part (it doesn't pull up super smoothly but this does not affect the final product).  I'm not going to lie, the bars on the pull-up handle seem a little cheap, like it's a lightweight aluminum.Overall, I give this product 4/5 stars (but it is subject to change).",Seems to be great quality for the price!,Color: navy2Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

They handled well and are sturdy enough. Some corners were slightly damaged (aesthetically speaking) by bumping into or hitting other luggage on conveyor belts during ground transportation at the airport. Other than that, we are very happy with the ease and comfort of these suitcases as they've worked well for us, despite being maxed out at 50.0lbs each at the airport scales (we pack really well, aided by a home scale) and had repacked items at home between the suitcases in order to find the best fit so it wasn't overstuffed.Buyer's notes: be sure you realize these are not expandable or are meant to expand in any way, so you have to be pack them properly, ie. as overstuffing them will likely create pressure and tear at the zippers. I've read posts where users said the zippers failed, so I wanted to be sure to mention that the ABS plastic does really well, but the rigidity is compromised if the suitcase is overstuffed and unbalanced. Proper packing is crucial, especially when flying. Handles work well. The rubber underside of the handles on the top or side (cushy for comfort) might become sticky with extreme heat and over the course of many years. Walls are of normal thinness given that they are lightweight, so don't expect these will thwart major accidental damage like piercing or collisions/major drops.  Wheels remain undamaged and continue to work well, but those are always the most fragile for suitcases these days. I think they are always going to be the most likely part to damage given that people want 360 degree spinning wheels for comfort. You will always be obligated not to dump a heavy suitcase onto the wheels for transport on concrete.

The hotel had padded carpet and I wheeled my luggage in and it was hard to get from the door through to check in. It was a long way and I had to stop a few times. I realize that it was because the wheels are so small and there is just one wheel unlike other luggage that has two wheels that are larger and the wheels were struggling to get through the heavily padded carpet.

The 3 pieces showed up in 1 box, nestled inside of each other and was pretty light considering the box held 3 pieces.  For our trip, we used the large and medium sizes.  My husband and I were staying for about 10 days in Vegas, and I always pack more than I need.  The majority of our clothing fit in the larger case and when it was weighed at the airport, it was about 60 lbs.  Luckily, we were flying first class or it would have cost us extra.  I don't remember the weight of the smaller one, but it was much lighter.  On the flight out, with no layovers, the luggage came off the plane with no problems.  The TSA locks were built in, so no need to fumble with keys.  It was also easy to change the code on the luggage.  While in Vegas, I shopped a bit.  As we were packing to leave, hubby didn't think it would all fit (we have previously bought additional luggage to bring purchases home!).  It even get the cases to zip closed, I had to sit on the case while i zipped it closed.  Hubby swore that the case would not make it home without busting, it was that full!  At the airport, both cases were flagged as heavy, but both were under the 70 lb limits.  On the flight home, we had to change planes, so luggage was thrown around between planes.  When we finally made it home and was waiting for the luggage to come off of the plane, we were wondering if all of our stuff would come off the plane in a bin and the luggage opened.  However, when it came down the conveyor belt, it was still in one piece, a little bit scuffed, but unopened.  The luggage held up great!  No issues with the zipper bursting or any crack of any kind on the cases.  Both pieces of the luggage were so full, they were hard to zip close.  And they held up.  Very happy with how these held up for the trip.  They maneuvered easily through the airports, with swivel wheels on all pieces.

I travel a lot for work and these have been great functionally.They have a ton of space and the pockets are great for holding odds and ends.My rating is only three stars for a couple reasons1) in the first pic, the rubber has already split and I ordered these in April.  I expect wear on the outside because the bags get beat up, but the inside, I would hope, would be more durable2) this isn't really coolife's fault necessarily, but it is their bag; however, when I got to my hotel room last night, the lock button was stuck on the luggage.  After googling around to figure out an inexpensive way to fix the lock without breaking it, I went to the store and got whatever tools I could find on a Sunday night and popped it open...lock is broken (which doesn't really bother me other than knowing I am using something that isn't fully functional), but the zippers still work, so I'll keep on using itAll in all, good bags, the wear on the inside just gives me pauseEDIT 7.15.19 - In the event of an issue I always wait to update my reviews until after speaking with customer service and getting some resolution.  After all, customer service is part of the product experience.  You hope that there aren't issues, but it happens.That said, Coolife reached out to me, and, while it took some time, patience is a virtue.  They addressed the issues and are sending me new bags to replace the ones showing wear (see pics).  The outside of the bags get beat up by the airlines, but Coolife's bags have been great for me over the past three months I've had them (traveling every week for work).When a crappy product offers to replace an item, I usually take the refund, because why do I want another junky item?

I don't travel much.  But when I do, I pack the Coollife.Update:  Within a few weeks of my review, Coollife customer service reached out to offer a replacement for the large case wheel alignment problem.

I love the way the bag is divided into two compartments so that I could have my husband's clothes and my clothes separate.  It was very easy to maneuver and the TSA had no problem with the locks.  I did notice that the TSA left their key hole in the unlocked position.  I used the tip of a knife to very easily turn it back so that we can lock it again.  We are very happy with our purchase. It was a big upgrade from our old two wheel, soft shell luggage.  We only used it for one round trip vacation so far.",Reasonable upgrade for old luggage,Color: family set-sky blueVerified Purchase,
