After arrival, I inspected the pieces thoroughly and found them to be well made.  The goal is to take only a carry-on and a personal bag each so we don't have to pay extra luggage fees. I did a pre-packing run to make sure how much we could fit inside and I was very happy.... So happy in fact, that I decided to order a set for myself too.  I pack by laying out my pants and shirts on top of each other, folding them in half,  and rolling them together.  I find that I fit far more in my bag that way. Here is what I fit inside the main area for myself without expanding the zipper for the extra 2 inches of room:2 pairs of jeans3 pair of mid calf capri pants5 shirts1 dress3 bras5 underwear1 pair sandals1 pair dress flats1 pair Nike running shoes1 swimming  suit1 beach cover-upIn the small outer pockets I packed:5 pair socks3 camis1 slipIn the smaller personal bag, I fit my 11 inch laptop in the large front pocket. In the main area, I fit the following:make-up, curling iron, deodorant, toothpaste, electric toothbrush with its charger, phone and charger,  travel size wet wipes and Kleenex packets, wallet, keys, snacks and a water bottle.There is a zippered long narrow pocket on the other side of the personal bag that is the perfect size in which to put your boarding pass. There is also a nice wide strap to loop over the handle of the carry-on so both bags can be pull transported through the airport.I rolled the bags all around my house on carpet and hardwood to test the wheels.  They functioned smoothly.  I parked the bag free standing and fully packed.  It remained upright.  Some reviewers have said their bags tipped over when packed.  Maybe it depends on what you have inside and how it is packed.I fly Delta and the fee for checked bags is $25 each way so a round trip would cost $50.  You are allowed one carry-on and a personal item for free.  I paid $29 for the owl print set,  $35 for the giraffe print set, and $29 for the solid purple set I bought for myself.  I know these will last many trips for my girls and I so it was definately worth the pittance of a price for these new luggage sets. I come out $1 cheaper after tax and with my free prime shipping ordering all of these than I would have to check 2 bigger bags. I packed enough clothes for each of us for a week. I actually could fit two weeks worth of clothes for my 5 year old since her things are smaller.  We are staying 3 weeks at grandma's house so we do laundrythere.  I'd much rather have the pretty new luggage for the price than to pack extra clothes and pay for the bag fee.  The way I figure it, even if we buy extra stuff there that won't fit on the way back, it's cheaper to mail it back in a priority mail one rate box than to pay luggage fees.

Why did I get two sets if I think it is one-star? Because the first set was great. It fulfilled its purpose and held my stuff when I traveled (only about once a month). However, it appears in 2015 they must have done a redesign. The most recent set I ordered is awful. The feet on the bottom were made to be more narrow and smaller, so no matter how you pack the rollaboard, it will fall-over when left standing on its own. It's very tedious to always have to make sure it is leaned against something while at an airport. On the second bag, the decal also fell off during the first use of the bag. The ""Rockland"" decal wasn't amazingly pretty or anything, but is just more evidence that they redesigned this luggage to be much lower quality.

This suitcase is deceiving - it looks smaller than what it actually is and I DID have room to spare.  I did use packing cubes because it is helpful to me, but I did manage to get a week's worth of clothing (no access to washing machine) that included 3 t-shirts, 2 leggings, 3 blouses, 3 camisoles, a light sweater, jeans, 2 pairs of shoes (1 was heels, the other was flats), and undergarments.  My clothes did not come out all wrinkled or incredibly creased - not more than you would get from folding your clothes and putting them in a drawer.  The empty space that is in there contained a makeup bag and the TSA approved baggie of toiletries.The small carry on was a bit more disappointing - a lot could be stuck in there, but regardless of size or weight of the items, it seemed to pull at the seams in a few different spots.  It is completely functional, though.  The zipper got stuck a couple of times, but I can't blame the making of the bag for this alone.Regarding sizing and durability, the suitcase itself does comply and fit into one of those 14"" x 22"" sizing things at the airport.  The smaller bag fits perfectly under the seats.  This suitcase went on 7 flights, including 2 that had to be valet checked because of the size of the aircraft and even wound up in the wing of a Cessna at one point.  It has a couple of dirt scuffs, but it is in otherwise perfect shape!One thing to note - if you put something (like sandals) in the front pouch of the larger one, it will topple over.  I do wish the base was sturdier, but I can't complain too much with the pricing of it.  I've read a couple reviews where it says it smells.  Yes, it is a bit smelly out of the box, but it is the smell as if it sat in a box in a warehouse.  If you let it air out, the smell goes away.Definitely a good combo and worth the price!",This suitcase!

Great quality, easy to pack and wheel around, I've taken it on at least a dozen trips on planes as well as Amtrak cross-country trips.  It still looks almost like new.So when I went looking for a small-ish wheeled carry-on bag w/ tote, I immediately came to Rockland.  For the price point, I wasn't expecting super great quality.  This set isn't horrible, but I would never want to check it, though -- I don't think it would ever stand up to even moderately rough treatment.The biggest problem is the wheeled carry-on bag.  It doesn't stand up by itself when packed.  It looks like it's supposed to, but the ""stand"" part near the front isn't sturdy or big enough to balance the bag.  So if you stop anywhere, you have to make sure you lean it against your leg or something.  REALLY annoying.  Also, it doesn't balance well on the wheels, so if you're pulling it through the airport, it flops over sideways.I think I'll be more likely to use this for short 2- to 4-day road trips, where I just dump it into the car and don't have to worry about wheeling it over long distances in an airport.The shoulder bag is OK, but the strap isn't really long enough for an adult, even fully extended.  Again, this is likely something I'll use for shorter road trips.Meanwhile, I'll keep looking for a decent carry-on bag set, and increase my budget.

They look good new, and the way they expand makes them very practical. They dont like to stand upright when full - they tend to topple forward.

Biggest complaint is that they arent durable.One broke in transit on only its 2nd or 3rd flight - material tore around the zippers, whole thing opened up - big mess on the baggage carousel. Was it overstuffed? Yeah, but not crazy.On another, the handle broke after 2 years - it had probably been on 10-15 flights.On a third, the zipper grip broke, which is a nuisance, but at least the bag is still useable.The 4th is in rough shape, but its still in use.For $30, you can do worse, but I'm dissatisfied with their fragility.

It's very tedious to always have to make sure it is leaned against something while at an airport. On the second bag, the decal also fell off during the first use of the bag. The ""Rockland"" decal wasn't amazingly pretty or anything, but is just more evidence that they redesigned this luggage to be much lower quality. Buyer beware!I've included a picture where you can see how the feet of the two rollaboards are different.",Buyer beware!

This suitcase is deceiving - it looks smaller than what it actually is and I DID have room to spare.  I did use packing cubes because it is helpful to me, but I did manage to get a week's worth of clothing (no access to washing machine) that included 3 t-shirts, 2 leggings, 3 blouses, 3 camisoles, a light sweater, jeans, 2 pairs of shoes (1 was heels, the other was flats), and undergarments.  My clothes did not come out all wrinkled or incredibly creased - not more than you would get from folding your clothes and putting them in a drawer.  The empty space that is in there contained a makeup bag and the TSA approved baggie of toiletries.The small carry on was a bit more disappointing - a lot could be stuck in there, but regardless of size or weight of the items, it seemed to pull at the seams in a few different spots.  It is completely functional, though.  The zipper got stuck a couple of times, but I can't blame the making of the bag for this alone.Regarding sizing and durability, the suitcase itself does comply and fit into one of those 14"" x 22"" sizing things at the airport.  The smaller bag fits perfectly under the seats.  This suitcase went on 7 flights, including 2 that had to be valet checked because of the size of the aircraft and even wound up in the wing of a Cessna at one point.  It has a couple of dirt scuffs, but it is in otherwise perfect shape!One thing to note - if you put something (like sandals) in the front pouch of the larger one, it will topple over.  I do wish the base was sturdier, but I can't complain too much with the pricing of it.  I've read a couple reviews where it says it smells.  Yes, it is a bit smelly out of the box, but it is the smell as if it sat in a box in a warehouse.

Great quality, easy to pack and wheel around, I've taken it on at least a dozen trips on planes as well as Amtrak cross-country trips.  It still looks almost like new.So when I went looking for a small-ish wheeled carry-on bag w/ tote, I immediately came to Rockland.  For the price point, I wasn't expecting super great quality.  This set isn't horrible, but I would never want to check it, though -- I don't think it would ever stand up to even moderately rough treatment.The biggest problem is the wheeled carry-on bag.  It doesn't stand up by itself when packed.  It looks like it's supposed to, but the ""stand"" part near the front isn't sturdy or big enough to balance the bag.  So if you stop anywhere, you have to make sure you lean it against your leg or something.  REALLY annoying.  Also, it doesn't balance well on the wheels, so if you're pulling it through the airport, it flops over sideways.I think I'll be more likely to use this for short 2- to 4-day road trips, where I just dump it into the car and don't have to worry about wheeling it over long distances in an airport.The shoulder bag is OK, but the strap isn't really long enough for an adult, even fully extended.  Again, this is likely something I'll use for shorter road trips.Meanwhile, I'll keep looking for a decent carry-on bag set, and increase my budget.

This bag has many ups and downs, depends on what you need it for.I bought this in an emergency when the wheel of my TravelPro fell off on thanksgiving and all stores were closed all week. Here are my thoughts after having it be my daily bag for three months.PROS:Fits on almost all planes even the small regional jets (which is what I primarily fly). Including CRJ 200,700,900 which have some of the smallest overhead bins. ERJ 175 was super easy to fit in, my bulky floor length jacket for comfortably on top.Ample space inside, fit enough for about 5 days comfortably if you’re a good packer.SUPER light which is awesome because it means you pack all the weight you can carry.Expandable, in case you go shopping you can fit an extra pair of smaller shoes and a few shirts.I never used the side bag BUT I find it super helpful. I would keep my bag toiletries and important documents and chargers so I can stuff it under the seat in front of me.If you travel only once in a while this is a good bag, BUTCONS:My biggest pet peeve was the super noisy wheels! It looks like the wheels do not have a rubber cover like the pricier roller bags and this was a PAIN to have follow you around the airport. Walking pathways, escalators, floor grills, concrete where the WORST! This is ultimately what deterred me from giving this bag a higher review.Also, the stitching was falling apart from week 1 which was disappointing because I was really rooting for this bag:( I don’t overpack often so I don’t think I was pushing it to its limits very often but this probably wouldn’t be a problem if you only use it once in a while.In conclusion: This is a “omg I have a trip this weekend and I don’t have a bag but I don’t want to pay too much but also have it be able to fit in the OHB on my small regional plane if I needed!” Bag! I will probably keep this bag for when I fly the CRJ aircraft until I splurge on a small TravelPro with warranty and food wheels.

I used it to pack for a 2-week international trip (using packing cubes, and having access to washing facilities at my destination). The rollycase easily held 1 pair of jeans, 4 t-shirts, 2 tank tops, 1 sweater, 2 bras, 7 pairs of underroos, 6 pairs of socks, 1 travel makeup bag, 1 travel toothbrush; the smaller bag held a 13"" laptop in a case with charger and headphones, 1 quart bag of liquids, 1 paperback book, and my cellphone---and there was even a little room (once the rollycase was expanded) to fit some souvenirs and Japanese snacks that are hard to find in the States.It loses 1 star because the telescoping handle isn't as sturdy as I'd like it to be and is a little bit particular when it comes to locking in place---sometimes I have to push it back down and pull up again to get the mechanism to catch, and for the love of god, definitely do not try to pick it up by the telescoping handle (you monster)---but for the price, I can deal with a wonky telescoping handle. It's also off-balance and has a tendency to fall forward, especially when expanded and with the smaller bag stacked on top (as mentioned in every other review), but this is less of an issue if you make sure to pack anything heavy towards the bottom of the rollycase.Tl;dr: If you're looking for affordable luggage, have proper expectations, and don't mind adjusting your habits to accommodate your price cap, this is a good set of luggage. If you want really good luggage at this price, expect it function like high-quality luggage, expect to be disappointed.","Minor flaws, as expected for the price",Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: Black PlaidProduct Packaging: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,18 people found this helpful

Please note that my review is mostly based on the larger suitcase...the smaller bag was a great size and worked perfectly for me but I feel like most people checking the reviews are probably more interested in the suitcase.Since buying it I have taken it on a plane a total of six times, which is not really enough times for me to speak to the durability but I have not had any problems so far. I travel fairly infrequently so I didn't buy this with the intent to use it very often though. No problems with the zipper sticking/breaking despite having crammed it as full as possible. The retractable handle has held up well so far. Wheels still working fine. I mostly used it as a carry on but did have to check it a couple times just due to limited overhead space on the plane, not the size being too big. I got the light pink which was great because it made it super easy to locate at the luggage carousel, but since it is a light fabric it got pretty visibly dirty during it's checked journey. Not really a problem and expected due to the light color of the fabric, but something to keep in mind if checking the bag if you are considering the lighter color.When using both pieces as my carry on luggage I did not have any problems with the size of either being too large, even when expanded (have taken it on American Airlines and Southwest flights). I like that the suitcase is expandable because I'm a notorious over-packer due to anxiety (I generally bring waaaaay too many clothes for my trip length so that I have them just in case) and each time I've used it I was able to fit everything I needed fairly easily.My least favorite thing about this luggage is that the suitcase only has two wheels. It rolled well when tilted but if you are standing in a slow-moving line you can't just set it upright and roll it. That part is not so bad, just a bit annoying, but it did have some balance issues when standing it upright. I didn't have any trouble until I hooked the smaller bag onto the retractable handle on the top (the strap on the back of the small bag is perfect for this). The smaller bag sits perfectly on top of the suitcase, but it did make it very top heavy (or front heavy?) so that it would fall forward if I wasn't holding onto it. Again, not a big deal, just a little annoying. None of my friends who had bags with four wheels had a problem with their bags not being about to stand upright.Overall, a good purchase considering the reasonable price. Next time when I upgrade I'll be looking for a bag with four swivel wheels instead, but in the meantime this does the job for a light traveler. I wouldn't expect it to hold up well for a heavy traveler however...not because I've noticed any visible damage yet but just based on the way it feels; not cheap exactly but it doesn't feel very durable.",Great for a light traveler on a budget,Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: PinkProduct Packaging: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

The colors and materials were true to the pictures, and they arrived on time and undamaged. They held up okay in the bag check process, although the large bag lost a zipper pull on the flight back at the end- this was easily fixed. They were also easy to carry on when needed. The wheels are nothing fancy- just one direction rollers- so running around the airport with these two bags and a jacket was not exceptionally easy, but doable. There is a good amount of space in these bags, and I used the large luggage to carry my clothes, shoes, and laptop and such, while I used the little bag to carry trip essentials (jacket, water, book, chargers, snacks, etc). Durability wise, I packed some heavy duty cold-weather camping sweaters and jackets in the mesh compartment of the large bag, and it ripped away from the liner at the bottom. It still functions, but I will have to be more careful with it in the future. Scuffs and scrapes made in travel wiped of easily with a damp rag.As a side note, I ended up buying some packing cubes to go with this set, and man, what a difference! It made this little set hold enough for two weeks away from home, with plenty of variety for weather ranging from 20 degrees and snowy for Idaho camping and 70 degrees and sunny swimming in the Gulf of Mexico.

I thought this design would be great to get her through until her pre-teen/teenage years, but wasn't too childish with a cartoon character on it. I'd say the suitcase is on the small side of a carry-on - I was able to fit 6 days worth of clothing plus an extra pair of shoes in her bag, but it was definitely a tight fit and the suitcase had to be repacked each time. Her toiletries had to be kept in a different bag just because we didn't have the room in the suitcase. The small duffel bag was great - we used it to keep all her toys in for the road trip. There was plenty of room for her books, tablet, drawing pads, etc. I liked that the duffel fit nicely on top of the suitcase, so she could manage her bags on her own if necessary. That feature would be great going through an airport or somewhere there is a lot of hustle and bustle. She struggled with the wheels not turning in all directions, which is a difficult task for me as an adult, so I understand. We live in the midwest and it was very snowy on our trip - when we got home, we found that all of her clothing was soaked through. I realized later that it must have been from the snow on our walks to and from the car and from sitting in the snow while we packed our car at the hotel.

The ONLY part of this suitcase I don’t care for is the retractable handle. The release button feels cheap and is a little TOO easy to press especially when gripping the handle compared to our other cases (American Tourister, Mia Toro, Samsonite, TravelersChoice). The locking mechanism to choose different heights, mainly mid extension is not as solid like the American Tourister suitcases even though they both seem to be almost identical maybe even made by the same maker. The rest of the bag is fairly nice. Wheels are smooth. Exterior material is very similar to a school backpack like Jansport. Zippers and the pull tabs seem to be pretty good. Stitching is good. The included bag is a nice addition. Was delivered in two days, four days sooner than Amazon’s expected delivery date.

Looks spacious enough to do the trick. My only complaint is the expandable handle seems.... kind of flimsy. Hopefully it doesn't cause me any problems on my trip. Traveling is stressful enough without luggage malfunctions!The small bag is really nice.

I'm glad to know I at least won't be bored on my 6+ hour flight this Thanksgiving!!*Update 12/29*: The carry on set made it to California and back to Wisconsin without a hitch. I literally carried Brandon Sanderson's Words of Radiance AND his new book Oathbringer (got it as a gift while in Cali), AS WELL as another small book and a tablet all in that small handbag. Holy pies, that was a crazy amount of strain to put on a cheapo traveling bag.Ok, so for context because maybe some of you who aren't huge fantasy readers might not understand how impressive that is, but Words of Radiance and Oathbringer are literally over 1,000 page books EACH. So... 2 massive books, a 350 page book and a tablet all managed to fit into that thing without issue. And I also had my wallet and other odds and ends in it too. If you're surprised, trust me, so was I. I was worried I was going to have to ask my mom to ship some things back to my place for me.My only complaint is that the bag would sometimes slip off of if you put it on top of the carry on with rollers. Which is kind of lame, but I'm not sure if it could be helped..? Also the strap on it was weird and not very long, so I couldn't find a way to comfortably throw it over my shoulders instead.The handle was still wobbly throughout the whole trip. But it worked. And didn't break, which was kind of surprising considering the.. you know... massive books I keep mentioning haha.Anyway, still really impressed with this set, and I would still wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a small luggage set on a budget.","For the price, I can't really complain much!",Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: KensingtonProduct Packaging: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

I loved the unique design that made picking up my bags at baggage claim a quick and easy process. Unfortunately, I ran into a couple problems with both sets. First, the pull out handle of the largest suitcase failed the first time it was used (first leg of a roundtrip), making it unusable because it was too heavy to push around without that.I ordered the second set with a different design, and luckily the pull out handle did not fail; however, the zipper of the inside netted area failed. I went to the old suitcase (with the non-functioning pull out handle) to see if I could take the zipper off of that suitcase and put it on the new suitcase. That's when I noticed that that zipper had also failed and the actual zipper was nowhere to be found.I would still recommend this set because the only issues have been with the largest suitcase of both sets.

So I wasn't using much of the space inside it.Overall, this is a pretty great suitcase for the price. I did get a few comments on the size and look of it (mostly because my travel companions brought bags that had to be checked and would have preferred to skip that baggage charge).My only complaint is that the bag, when full, tends to fall over when it's in upright position. I didn't care if it had the four wheels or the two but the stoppers at the bottom were either too short or just placed oddly because the suitcase almost always tipped over when I tried to stand it up on its own.Still, it was worth what I paid and served its purpose so I have no substantial complaints.",Great suitcase for short trips and carry on,Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: BlueProduct Packaging: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,27 people found this helpful

Poor design; the ""feet"" in the front need to be longer to keep it from falling.The smaller bag is a nice size, but the design is just plain dumb. The metal rings are so far down the side of the bag, that the bag will not stay upright, either. It flips upsidedown as you walk with it on your shoulder.

I didn't see any obvious flaws with the zippers, webbing, cover material, wheels, or handle.  (The handle wobbled a little, but not enough to make me think that it was going to break.)  These suitcases should have no problems protecting your belongings on many car trips and cruises.  I feel that, with normal airline handling, they would do well on quite a few airplane flights.

It inconvenient and I have changed my tactics to only using 1 of the shoulder bags for snacks, and a regular backpack for my kiddos books and toys on the plane to avoid unnecessary shuffling.

We looked inside, and discovered that one of the catches that keeps it extended wouldn't release when the button was pressed.

The color was true to the pic and I really liked the design. (I still kinda just want to keep it but it's really not what I need)My only issue, and this is personal preference, not anything against the luggage, is that the main bag is on the smaller side of a carry-on at 19"", and I want any luggage I have to be the max allowable size for that category, and I also felt the smaller personal bag was too small to utilize well as your personal item but too big to be a toiletry bag so it didn't serve any real purpose for me. I do have a small 11"" laptop and I was able to fit it into the front zip pocket of the small bag so that is something to note. That was def the max size that would fit in that pocket.This company also makes wheeled duffle bags with the same designs, sold on Amazon for half the price of this set.

All small enough for carry on. I had 5 flights, stupid layovers, but these bags were so convenient. There is a strap on the back of the small bag that slides right over the extended handle of the roller so you only ever hold the one bag... unless you want to carry both. Some of the planes were so small that they had to check my larger bag under the plane and pick up after landing. Well the design made it so easy to find, and I never had to produce my check ticket because I had the exact matching bag. So worth it to get a stand out design. I watched everyone else dig through the black ones to find theirs. I will never get black ever again after watching that! The only thing I would change is the wheels. I wish the wheels were rubber instead of plastic. When I went on the fast walk in the airport everyone could hear it as I walked... it was loud! And it isn't multi-directional. Meaning it only goes forward and back, you can't maneuver side to side. So if the wheels were different this would be absolutely perfect but it was still excellent for my experience. The fabric is great, the storage is what you would expect for its size. Nothing standout about the inside. It is the same a I have always seen.

I have to stay 2 nights at the hospital with my baby and this bag holds everything PERFECTLY.  (I bought the giraffe set, it’s just too cute and I couldn’t resist. It came exactly how the pictures look. No damage and no stains.) I used the larger size bag for all of my things, and the smaller bag for the baby’s things. The larger bag has clips inside to insure your items are not being tossed around. It also has a zipper that opens up so you get an extra inch or two of space when closing up the bag. Which helped me perfectly. I have read that some people have a problem with the bag tipping over, and I noticed mine does if it’s not placed just right. However, I took my heavy toiletry bag out from the top half, and noticed it didn’t tip anymore. So if you’re having a tipping problem, just try to pack the heaviest things on bottom and that may help!  The smaller bag is great just as it is and has a nice little sleeve to slide over the handle of the larger bag when in use. Which will be so helpful when pulling it through the hospital. There’s also a zipper and pocket in back, which I didn’t notice. It’d be perfect for a boarding pass or passport for travelers!Overall I love this little duo and I plan on eventually purchasing the red set for my fiancé!",Great light weight travel combo!,Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: GiraffeProduct Packaging: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

The suitcase and its little companion are beautiful, but not being able to use the handle really reduces its utility as a carry-on for an airplane trip.Update with temporary fix ... after watching several Youtube videos, I decided to try using electrical tape to fix the handle. Looking behind the zipper that reveals the handle mechanism inside the larger suitcase, I found that the lowest pin on one side of the tube that carries the handle was not retracting when the button on top of the handle was pushed. The handle button pushed in easily but the handle still couldn't be pulled out.So I did this procedure:1)  I folded 3/4 inch wide electrical tape onto itself several times, cut it from the roll, and then bent my little ""plug"" of tape in half to make a shape that fit well nside the oval opening in the metal tube.2)  I wrapped the folded piece in one inch of tape in the folded position to keep the lump/plug  bent and smooth.3) I cut a 2 inch piece of tape and  a 3/4 inch piece. I used the 3/4 inch piece to secure my plug to the middle of the sticky side of the 2 inch piece (the plug was perpendicular to the 2 inch piece of tape).4) Finally, I wrapped the tube with the 2 inch piece, making sure the plug fit well and snuggly into the hole.  While wrapping the tube, I made sure to stretch the tape a bit to make sure it fit tightly against the hole in the tube.So far it's working, although the Youtuber said it's only a temporary fix. I'm not changing the review stars since this problem shouldn't have existed in the first place, but maybe someone can benefit from these instructions if they have the same problem.Otherwise the suitcase, as I said before, is beautiful.",The pull-handle won't pull out ... update with temporary fix,Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: Magenta LeopardProduct Packaging: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase,

Color/design options are also great as well.Can't really find any cons on this, the only for me would be that it was a TAD smaller than I expected (both the luggage and personal item). I usually fly American/United and was looking for luggage that fit the exact dimension of the carry-on policy. The carry-on piece itself is right under the limits.After I purchased this, I found the Ricardo Beverly Hills carry on piece that is a bit bigger with the 360 wheels and fits the carry on dimensions for most carriers (picture to compare the 2 as well) and it had more depth as well than this Rockland set.Also, the personal item that you can use is great, however, it is smaller than the exact dimensions for a personal item. So if you are looking for that, I was able to find a small adidas duffel bag that you can technically use as a personal item that fit the dimensions for it (American/United- if you are a heavy packer like me).I do love that this can be used for children too so my daughter will be getting a pink set here soon.  I would use this piece still even though I love my Ricardo Beverly Hills. So far, this has been used for road trips for me and it's great! It has lots of pockets and if you pack right, you can fit a lot in here (take a look at YouTube videos for packing tips as well as buying some packing cubes here on Amazon).I use the smaller personal item bag as a laptop bag and as well as just everyday, on the go use and love it.If you are flying with a smaller airline/carrier such as Spirit or Frontier, I definitely recommend these as well!This is definitely a set worth buying. Light weight, has pockets, and a personal item with it.

The design and color/print are great, just as vibrant in person. As far as durability, the handle is starting to come out after one trip/usage. One side clearly isn’t as sturdy (when you pull upwards it extends further than it’s supposed to). There is also very minimal maneuverability with the wheels.. my prior luggage had 360° wheels and I miss that a lotttt with this bag. If I could do it over, I’d probably buy something else that wasn’t as pretty/cute but would last longer.

The only negative I have is that the bags don’t seem to be the best of quality, so I’m not sure how long they would last if you did A LOT of traveling and the luggage bag tends to topple over if left standing upright on its own. I would still recommend this bag for someone looking for a nice, casual set of carry-on bags.",Good for casual travel,Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: PurpleProduct Packaging: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

They’re both good quality and perfect for carry on on an airplane. The only problem is the luggage with wheels will fall face forward once it’s full. So let’s say you’re in line for boarding your plane and dragging your luggage with you but had to stop for a moment to pull out your boarding pass etc. Be prepared that your luggage will fall face down as soon as you let your grip. So make sure to face it towards yourself to prevent it from falling. I guess the wheels are not perfectly centered do it looses its balance easily.

However, the roller bag as a carry on is great: fits in overhead compartments without a problem on JetBlue, Southwest, & Aeroflot. Carrying the small bag on top of the roller is a good way to get around, though they do get heavy because it is not an upright roller and you have to position them so they do not fall over because putting the second bag on top of the first as indicated makes everything top heavy.",Good overall,Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: OwlProduct Packaging: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

I also received random compliments on my luggage throughout the airport. The rolling luggage fit perfectly into the overhead storage on Delta airlines and I never experienced issues with size. I'm fairly positive that even with the wheels and handles, it falls under the size regulations. I will be looking forward to see how well this luggage holds up over time with more travelling. I do want to note that the shoulder bag is extremely roomy and an excellent companion to my carry-on luggage, however the shoulder strap design could have been done better. The should strap attaches to the back about halfway down on the sides. What this means is that the bag likes to flip over even when you are carrying it. The weight in my bag was evenly distributed and did not seem top heavy but with where the shoulder strap is located, it certainly acted top heavy and became a nuisance after a while. All in all though, this was an excellent buy.",Perfect for Delta Airlines,Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: New Black DotProduct Packaging: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

It's not a luxury item, it's not anything impressive but it gets the job done. I purchased the set very last minute for a trip abroad. I had no problems with the luggage and quite enjoyed all the pockets and zippers. It's nice that even this set expands. In fact, it can expand so much that the weight of the expansion will tip it over (this happened to me a lot). If you don't mind rolling a two-wheeler (or stacking it on top of another luggage piece) this will be fine for you. It kept my items dry in the pouring Paris rain. I used it as my carry on with American Airlines, Quatar Airways, British Airways, Easy Jet, And Emirates without any size or weight issues. It has made it around the world without any serious issues. Only defect I can think of is that the handle needs two hands to get it to go down.I still use the set day to day. You can fit a lot more than you think in it.

Others have complained that the bag tips forward..here’s my experience with that. I put my computer in the very front pocket which did tip the bag forward. However, my MacBook Air also fit perfectly in the smaller personal bag, so without the computer in the front of the big carry on bag, it wouldn’t tip over. My opinion, if you put too much weight on the front..the bag will tip over. I did not have any issues with my bag tipping over once I put my computer in the smaller personal bag.Both bags fit perfectly on the plane (Delta). The smaller personal bag fits perfectly under the seat in front of you, and the bigger carry on luggage fits perfectly in the overhead bin.Will be buying another for my boyfriend!! Highly recommend, and it’s at a great price!!Great luggage set! I was iffy about the purchase because the stock photos and some other reviewer’s photos made the bag look smaller than what I was looking for in a carry on bag. However, after receiving the set, I can honestly say I was surprised and super happy with my purchase! Not to mention this pattern is too cute. (Don’t mind my cute PJs lol) but I wanted to share a photo of the bags standing next to me for reference.

I also think it would be nice it the main compartment on the shoulder bag had two zippers instead of one so you dont have to open the whole thing to grab something but again, not a deal breaker for me.

It's a pleasing colour and I like the fact that it's light. The small bag fits on top of the larger one, which is great. I could move them as one rather than two pieces. There is a good amount of room, while still being small and light. There is an extra zipper on the larger piece which expands the inside about an inch and that is very handy.Now for the negatives. The wheels are very small and I had a hard time controlling the luggage. It would twist about and was just annoying. And it won't stand up straight. It falls over toward the front. I thought it might be because I had the small bag on top of the larger one, but when I took it off, it still would fall over. I had to lean it against myself or something else to have it stand upright. I suspect if I hadn't put anything in the front pockets , it may not have tended to fall over, but I really liked the front pockets, so that defeats the purpose. I also wondered if having four wheels on the bottom would not be a  better setup. I observed other people with four wheeled luggage and they were able to control it much better than I, even though mine was much smaller. And one of the inside zippers broke as well. Not good for the first time one uses this luggage!All in all, I am not sorry I bought the luggage. It was a good price, but I do think it could be improved somewhat.

The wheels and handle never stuck, and nothing ripped nor did it fail me in some form or fashion.For the money I spent, I was expecting something that would've been good for like one or two trips tops, but it has held up to even some of the crazier traveling I have done. Also the weight, it's like four or five pounds or so just on its own without anything in it, and when you travel carry on some airlines do check your luggage weight, so that easily adds up. And I know it's small, but I'm always stressed about it not fitting in the cabin for carry on, so that's also why I want a different one eventually.","Cheap, reliable",Size: 2-Piece Set (14/19)Color: Black PlaidProduct Packaging: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Unzipped the lining, and found that everything inside was riveted together well, and the hardware for the telescoping handle is screwed to a sturdy piece of wood inside. The skate wheels spin well, rolls over carpet and concrete just fine. And very cute purple design.Before ordering this, I went to TJ Maxx and checked out the other brands. I looked at Samsonite, American Tourister, Delsey, Nautica, TravelPro. They seemed too big and bulky, especially the pockets on the front which bulge out and make those cases really thick when lying flat. When I fly, I see all these people trying to shove huge cases into the overhead compartment. Those are the ones from TJ Maxx.The small matching hand-held case is okay, nothing special. It will hold a tablet or 10"" NetBook, but not a 15"" MacBook Pro. In addition, there's room for all your chargers, phone, wallet, sunglasses, and a camera or two.
