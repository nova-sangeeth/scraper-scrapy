In one picture I used a queen size pillow to show the width of the bag. You can probably fit two of those pillows and still have some room.This bag is definitely bigger than I expected but I’m happy I went with the large size instead of medium because having extra space is better than not having enough space. I got this for my husband to use for short trips or when he has to work an overnight shift. It fits a large, adult sized throw blanket, a small pillow , a couple pairs of clothes, a pair of size 10 men’s shoes, and a toiletry bag and still leaves a lot of room left. You could probably fit a week or two weeks worth of clothes in it.There’s a shoe pocket on one side which I think is so cool so you can separate shoes from all the other things you want to put in it. It has a small pocket inside of it, big enough to fit a wallet or phone, etc. , a front zipper pocket that you can fit small items In, plus another pocket on the opposite side of the shoe pocket that you can fit a couple of full sized shampoo bottles In (just to give you an idea of size) . It comes with an adjustable, removable strap to wear on your shoulder and the material of the bag is pretty thick and durable.Overall I’m so happy I purchased this and my husband said it is perfect and exactly what he needs.
