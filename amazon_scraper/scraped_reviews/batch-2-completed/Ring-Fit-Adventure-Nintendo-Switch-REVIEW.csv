Lauren Landau,amzn1.account.AGCHKUTXBKXBX327YBTBD7MRMPKQ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2019",0,,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Fit-Adventure-Nintendo-Switch/product-reviews/B07XV4NHHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm honoured to be the first to review this product on Amazon (assuming no one beats me to it while I'm typing this). This marks two unusualities (yes I'm aware that's not a word) for me in two days. The latter being writing a review on Amazon (or writing reviews in general), which I hardly if ever do. The first was yesterday when I exercised for the first time in approximately 2-3 years playing Ring Fit Adventure. That's not to say I've been completely sedentary for the last 2 years (for example, I spent two months in Europe this summer, did a fair amount of walking) but truly *working out* yeah, it's been a hot minute.Some quick background info, I'm a 29-year-old female law student. I spend approx 93% of my time studying. The other 7% is split between eating and sleeping, so there isn't a whole lot of time for me to suit up and head to a gym. Sure, there's a gym in my apartment's basement, as well as on my school's campus (also in the basement) but what would I do? hit the treadmill for 35mins? Sure, I could do that and probably to my benefit. Would be good cardio. But I don't do that either. Why? I just don't wanna. /shrug.I played Ring Fit Adventure for about an hour yesterday (probably closer to 40 mins of total gameplay) and let me just say - I'm SORE today. My arms and shoulders FEEL like they had a good workout. And the crazy bit is... I can't wait to do it again!! Literally about to pop on my leggings right now and go for round two (though I'll probably try to focus a bit more on my core and legs) but what's nice is I *CAN* do that! The variety in this game is nuts. I never played Wii Fit (or owned a Wii) but I heard it was just ""ok"" and didn't *really* give you a workout. Mostly yoga poses and maybe some core work. Here, you have TONS of options to choose from, and what's great is each exercise tells you exactly what part of your body it's targeting, and gives you proper form and posture. It's up to you to do the moves correctly, but honestly, if you're trying your best to match Tipp (your posture guide - how cute!) you're probably gonna be fine.Before you even start playing, the game guides you through a really clear set-up and calibration process. The calibration is key because it, along with inputting your weight and fitness level, will help the game adjust to your needs. But don't worry about messing up because you can recalibrate whenever you want. It's honestly pretty cool. The game starts you off with only a handful of moves, expanding as you level up (and each move has a ""recharge"" time so you can't just keep spamming the ones that you like/are good at). But you can access ANY of the moves by going into ""quick play"" or ""custom"" if you just want a quick workout and don't want to go into the game. Every set you start (whether it's a level or world in the game or your own selection) will tell you how long (approximately) it should take, and the calories you should expect to burn. Every time you complete a workout you can hold your thumb over the IR sensor in the right joycon and it will take a measure of your heart rate, letting you know if you're in the right zone for fitness. I checked this reading against my Apple Watch, and it seemed fairly accurate.You don't actually even need to turn on the game to get in a bit of a workout. If your Switch is in sleep mode and you click in the joystick, the game will register every time you flex the RingCon. So you can be passively pacing around your house, squeezing the RingCon (with /really/ satisfying auditory feedback, might I add) and be racking up points in the game! I'm not sure I've ever called a game or game accessory ""genius"" but holy cow... it's genius.The RingCon is STURDY and well-made, and feels GREAT in the hand. The grips are made of this beautiful sweat soaking material (so you never feel like your palms are gross and sweaty) that you can remove and wash, and the ring itself is made out of a really nice soft, velvety feeling plastic. And honestly, the resistance is perfect. Yes, I'm an out-of-shape law student, but really, do enough reps and you're going to be feeling it too. They started me at level 10 based on the calibration and information I gave them. That doesn't necessarily mean 10 reps for every move though, and I haven't quite figured out the difficulty leveling system yet (is 10 just the maximum they'll give me? still playing around with that) but I've seen video reviews online of pretty fit men playing the game and it set them at say, level 30. This isn't your in-game level, just your personal difficulty level. You'll always start the game at level 1.Now, who is this game for? Well, as I said, I'm an almost-30-year-old-law-student, and I'm loving it. However, someone with more /refined/ or /mature/ tastes may find the game a little cringey/cutesy (I'm referring only to ""Adventure"" mode). I've seen reviews that say the game isn't sure if it's targeting kids or adults, but IMHO, anybody can play this game and feel like it's ""for"" them. Some people may find Ring's voice annoying but I find it motivating, so you'll have to decide that for yourself. What I will say is, if you already own a Switch, and game on it, you'll probably be fine with it. Adventure mode is cute and endearing, and the villain Drageaux is hilarious.Bottom Line:This review has gone on far too long at this point, so congratulations if you've read this far. But if you're like me, and have zero motivation to exercise, but WANT to make a lifestyle change, I feel like this might be it. Will I be able to keep this up on a regular or semi-regular basis? I don't know. I hope so! Will I get bored of it? I really hope not. But for now, all I know is I really enjoyed my time with it yesterday, and am ready to get back into it today. 5/5 Stars.",An Actual Workout,Verified Purchase,"1,603 people found this helpful","1,621",5,Public,481705

I look forward to day 5 tomorrow. Including days I work. I don’t typically exercise this much.The workouts provided so far have been general aerobics with plenty of core exercises and light resistance training thanks to that fascinating squeezeable ring known as the Ring-con and the leg band making use of the Joy-con’s gyro controls. The work outs get my heart rate up (the joy con tells me it goes up to the 140s). I’ve stretched muscles. I feel good after playing a session. Light but meaningful gains.The game executes what it needs to well with adventure mode enveloping the exercises in more curious trips and battles. It takes it exercises seriously promoting pre-stretch and post-stretch that varies depending on the exercises you did during your session (big props to that concept). Add to it a really colorful world and motivational tips and educational elements, and it’s a great meaningful session each time I boot the game. Really great design.I expect Tipp, Dragaux (sp?), or the Ring Con character to be a Smash Brother character in the future.HIghly recommended.",I’ve exercised 4 days in a row.

There's a brief instructional video to help you fit and adjust the leg strap, and then the software menu appears. I wanted to see what quick-play was like, and there are a series of options -- targeted muscle groups, mini-games, and a third option. I chose the targeted tasks first, and that is a really fun way to get your blood flowing. The exercises are challenging, but everything adjusts to your comfort level, and strength level.I then did the treadmill mini game, and that was a lot of fun. My cat simply watched me as I ran in place trying to align myself with the coins coming my way.After an extensive run and a good workout, I loaded the Adventure, did the tutorial, watched the introduction vid, and completed the first course. All I can say is wow, this is really dynamic, exciting, fun, and very good exercise, though it's so easy to adjust to any fitness level, that the workout intensity is truly in the users hands.I'm blown away that so much exercise potential could be housed in such a small box. The ring is really good quality, and very easy to get use to. My hands took to it with ease. I will say the leg strap will take some getting use to, as you really need that balance of tight enough so it won't run down your leg, and yet not so tight it will restrict blood-flow!Overall, this has amazing potential, but the RingFit is like any exercise equipment, you need to use it and stick with it in order for it to do you any good, and for me the software certainly makes me want to keep coming back for more, and I also love you can use it even when your Switch is off, though I haven't had a chance yet to test this, I'm sure it will be a very handy feature.Great product, great software, and I feel this gem is yet another fantastic reason for me to love my Nintendo Switch!!!",Amazing Game & Fitness Tools,Verified Purchase,190 people found this helpful,754,245,Public,173615
Benjamin Robitille,amzn1.account.AF3QQD6OOMOJFTW5AMERIZJ3RYLQ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2019",0,,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Fit-Adventure-Nintendo-Switch/product-reviews/B07XV4NHHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Mainly writing a review because I'm seeing some very... odd criticisms leveled at this game.First the obvious Amazon issue where people use the product review page to rate the shipping, the seller, or other various issues with receiving the product rather than the product itself. There are areas to review that and leave feedback/ratings. The product page is not it.Now, on to criticism of the product I've seen that is very strange. First of all, complaints about graphics. The graphics are fine. More than fine, it's a very nice looking game. No, it's not bouncing 8k ray-tracing at 144 frames per second with physics computed in the cloud simulating every molecule of dust in the wind, but it's a game about jogging and fighting sentient yoga mats with thighmaster powers, on the Nintendo Switch. The textures are sharp, the colors are vibrant, the animation is on point and the resolution/framerate are high and solid. Unless you simply have something against the art style, I fail to see how one could complain about the graphics here.Now the second common complaint I've seen regard the progression. Namely, things are unlocked at a very slow pace. This depends on your perspective, in my opinion. The game's adventure mode is not meant to be beaten over a weekend, but instead used to help get the player into a more fit routine over the course of several months. The total percentage of things you unlock is done at a very slow pace, yes.. I've been playing for 10 days, and have yet to unlock the skill tree I've seen in places like IGN reviews and the like. However, that's not to say I've found the unlocks to come at a snail's pace.I've been playing the game for little more than the recommended 10 minutes of physical activity per day. (Ring Fit Adventure tallies up active time separately from time spent with the game simply on) In these 10 days, I've made it to the 5th world, have 4 different sets of outfits with 2 more purchasable if I earn enough gold, unlocked 9 or 10 different smoothie recipes, and have something like 20 exercises I can equip for battle. There's also a catalog to track your unlocked things, and according to that I've only unlocked about 6 percent of the smoothie recipes.. Yeah, it'll take a long time to get 100% unlocked, but there are a LOT of things to unlock and my short sessions involve several unlocks per day.Now, the actual important thing... how is Ring Fit Adventure as an exercise game?I loved the idea of an exercise RPG as soon as I saw it announced. I did use Wii Fit U for a few weeks, but the lack of variety made it feel about as exciting as your average treadmill. It did the job, but it was hard to feel enthusiastic about playing.Ring Fit Adventure on the other hand has the RPG aspect, and while I'm not super invested in the story (so.. dragon? Magic fitness ring that talks? Strange lands and exercise equipment trying to kill me? Not chomping at the bit for the next page of the story...) the RPG style progression has me ready to continue my adventure every day. In 10 days, I've reached character level 30 and still love seeing the ""GAINS!"" flash on the screen, increasing my attack/defense stats.As exercise itself, it also can be more intense than you think. Currently, I'm playing on difficulty level 16. There are 30 total difficulty levels, and the main difference is in how many reps you need to do per set during a fitness battle. It also appears to change how fast you have to move during sprinting sections when running through the levels.Now, I'm not massively out of shape, but I'm a 36 year old man who was slowly melting into ""dad bod"" and didn't want that. In the 10 days I've been doing Ring Fit Adventure, I started on difficulty level 9 (answering a few questions about my age, weight and desired difficulty) and have slowly added in more difficulty levels when I feel comfortable. Comfortable is a relative term though, as I've been worked so hard by this game I've ended up sore.. and yes, that's with only 10 or 14 minute sessions each day.After each level, you are given the option to check your heart rate with the right joy-con's infrared camera. I've read many reviews that say it gives wildly varied readings that don't line up with reality and is thus a broken feature, but I've had much better luck with it. Yes, sometimes the reading is off but that's because I put my thumb in the wrong spot (kinda hard to get it perfect when you're exhausted) but still, it won't just spit out a number. It'll tell me the reading is having trouble, and try again. The trick? Do what the picture on the TV says. Line the pad of your thumb up with the IR camera, don't press too hard, and hold. It's easiest for me with my hand in the same position as shown on the TV, with my left hand supporting the ring-con, so I don't shake all over the place.Also, YES DRINK WATER. I don't remember sweating nearly this much from Wii Fit, but I can't go one session in Ring Fit Adventure without dripping sweat... which makes Ring saying ""Your sweat is so shiny and beautiful!"" all the creepier, but I digress.Overall, Ring Fit Adventure does what it sets out to do. The RPG hook is enough to keep me coming back not for the story, but for the grind. If you've tried things like Wii Fit, or other attempts to gameify fitness but simply getting fit wasn't enough of a draw to keep you coming back, Ring Fit Adventure might work for you. Defeat dumbell crabs with squats and planks!Just watch out for Ring... that thing is so into fitness, it is honestly worrisome....----UPDATE----I've continued playing, now on day 25 of the adventure. Still playing just about the 10-14 minutes a day the game gives before asking if I want to stop. In this time, I have upped the difficulty up to level 20, and I've kept it there for the last few days as certain exercises still are very difficult in but one rep set.I've also been keeping track of my weight over this time, and while I haven't seen much of a shift there, I have been noticing I'm toning up pretty well. If I actually bothered to count calories, I could really shed some fat in a hurry with this game helping me out.The game keeps track of all the exercise you've done, and I have burnt over 1000 calories with my morning Ring Fit Adventure. Of course the more difficulty you add, the more reps you have to do, the more calories you burn. However, the game also seems to still keep the 10 minute rule before it asks if you want to stop. I usually do, but sometimes I feel like I just started exercising and keep playing until I'm spent. If I do that too many days in a row, I up the difficulty.I can say for certain my abs are really toning up. I still have a bit of a belly, but you can actually see my abs under the little layer of flab. Whey protein has been a big help in making me not feel so sore, and allowing my muscles to heal and strengthen after a session in Ring Fit Adventure.Finally, as I've continued playing I've found SO MUCH MORE STUFF in the game. Doing sidequests has overleveled me on normal content, so I'm about 5 levels above the enemies I'm facing right now. That mainly means I don't have to use smoothies as often in battle, and can instead sell them for gold if I need it.There are tons of outfits to unlock, and they have different set bonuses. At level 40, the skill tree was finally unlocked and I started earning skill points per level. At level 65, the skill tree expanded, and I learned the fit skills have RANKS, and I just barely saw that 2 star ranks exist.Every time I unlock something new in this game, I get the feeling that I'm still barely scratching the surface.Oh, and also I found the tiny text on the box about how to clean the ring-con's hand grips, if they get stinky from so much sweat, they are removable (held on by velcro) and you're supposed to hand wash them in warm water with mild detergent, and let them air dry away from direct sunlight. Only says that on the box in a very tiny spot that's easy to miss, so I figured I'd add it here.",Turn those burnt calories into experience points!,Verified Purchase,140 people found this helpful,223,6,Public,3412321

Getting into the game it has you calibrate the controllers once they're in the accessories and I was MEGA blown away by how smooth and accurate it is, not a movement goes unnoticed which is amazing.  Another talking point is that even though I'm only two levels in (since I've only had it a couple hours) it's cute, it's funny, I love that it's just the right amount of silly- there are quite a few exercise puns already so if you like that kind of silly humor (I certainly do) then you'll love it.  Another thing, and I can't recall if it was mentioned in the promos, is that there are actually a lot of outfits to unlock for your character I was so suprised- since I'm only at the start I've not unlocked any yet but the prospect of customization as you go is pretty cool.  Lastly the fight system is reminiscent of ye olde final fantasy games, you bump and whoosh into a battle- except instead of choosing fight commands you're choosing moves to use against them which feels really interactive. Honestly so far it just plays like a rpg adventure but with your body as a controller. If you're on the fence about it and can afford it I'd say give it a go- It's definitely worth the money to me so far lol",AWESOME better than expected so far!,Verified Purchase,95 people found this helpful,182,38,Public,864166

I was very frustrated when I was too tired after playing for 30 minutes and working so hard I was in the high end of my cardiovascular zone the whole time that I needed to stop for a while.  The exercise is actually good.  The resistance band is enough you can do some good workouts.  The exercises use your bodyweight as resistance.  The Super Mario style running through levels to get coins is engaging and enjoyable with the varied actions, and gradually you release more exercises as you play - which is great, because my deltoids burned by the end of it, and I needed a break.The game having The old Wii Fit guy show you how to do poses and actions is incredibly helpful though does briefly pull away from the immersion.The reminders to play again are great.  This takes gamefied fitness to a whole new level, and I love it.Room for growth:The RPG elements on it could use a bit more depth than a weird gym universe, because let's be real, it's a dragon in a leotard that will end the world.  That said, I do hope they bring more traditional turn-based RPGs to this medium like a Final Fantasy or a remix of Zelda or really anything that has a bit more depth but similar mechanics.Some people have complained about using the joycon to measure heart rate.

Allows me to start at my own level and asks me every time whether I want to step things up, stay the same, or dial things down a bit.

There's even a lot of variation in the stretching and cool down segments4. I don't find the exercises boring. The 'adventure' part of the program tosses in enough content to keep your mind engaged (things like the need to open doors, 'jumping' over things you encounter, going up stairs, engaging adversaries etc.) that you need to pay attention to what's on the screen, and the related physical activities break thing up enough so even though I'm exercising I'm not getting bored5.

Once because I was desperate and decided to use a treadmill, and the other time because it was required for a gym membership, and I only wanted that membership for access to a climbing wall and a pool. In general, all of my physical activity is outside with various sports and physical outdoor activities. The concept of using machines in a gym has frustrated me--I would rather be outside or at home. Going somewhere to awkwardly use machines around a bunch of other people who are either equally awkward or gym-fanatics has never appealed to my tastes.But now...I am on Day 14 of the Ring Fit Adventure with no signs of slowing down.I am doing thigh presses, squats, and things that I always thought were silly.I used to adamantly tell my wife that I would never do yoga...and yet here I am doing Warrior Pose and Tree Pose like a boss.Why? Because video games are addictive. My urge to complete every video game to 100% and on hard mode has finally manifested itself into something positive. Dragaux must be stopped, and if I end up getting ripped in the process so be it.In all seriousness, the ""game play"" is average or mediocre, and the strategy optionality is basic, but the overall concept is somehow still addictive. I am losing weight and becoming significantly more fit after only 2 weeks of 15 to 30 minutes of equivalent workout time daily (which the game tracks separately from total playing time). I am constantly sore, and it feels good. My only request for future improvement would be allow for use of secondary joycon sets that track more body movements. For instance, a second set of ring and strap for your other limbs.I will also attempt to update this review when I ""complete"" the quest to see if the interest in playing remains.","Finally, video game addiction is doing something positive for me.",Verified Purchase,29 people found this helpful,149,59,Public,1089169

So when purchasing this game, I made a bet with my girlfriend. I promised I will continue to play it for 30 days, at least 30 mins per day. She agreed to buy me another Switch game if I can fulfill this promise, otherwise I will buy her something else.30 days passed and I win! The first 10 days was the biggest challenge since the workout is not trivial at all. I was honest to my fitness level and chose a starter difficulty of 26. Every 30-min workout was really hardcore and make you sweaty. Afterwards, I found myself become addicted to this game. The reason is threefold: 1) It's a RPG and you can grow your character in level, ability, skills, etc. and have collections to do. Once you reach certain level (~20), you will be self-driven to become more powerful. 2) You can FEEL the changes happen to your body. Initially I felt so tired in squats but after continuous training, I could feel my muscles become firmer and squats became easier. 3) Before this game, I don't know what's the amount of training I should do every day and gave up when felt tired. But this game makes you to exceed your limit a bit every day (to earn more coins, level up, etc.) and you can really feel that you are becoming more powerful.Traditionally, video game rewards are virtual, but this game gives you REAL REWARDS! There's lots of content ahead. I have been playing it for 30 days and just finished world #7, but there are over 20 worlds! Even though I won the bet with my girlfriend, I am addicted to this game and will continue until finished! I am thinking about posting videos or live streaming this game in my YTube channel.

The ""ring"" works very well and shows a lot of potential as a device for work-outs in the future of the industry.The flaw is in the game. It's a cute adventure RPG that focuses heavily on the aspect of ""working out.""  Even the bad humor is work-out themed, from character names, to drinking healthy smoothies for beneficial effects in fights. Where it really loses points with me is in its repetitive nature. I'm several stages into the game and the boss fights have always been against the same boss, I've only come across maybe six or seven different enemies, and my work-out ""moves"" are always limited to a choice of 5 or 6. It's not a bad game, but it hasn't had me wanting to go back each day and continue my quest--it's just weak story telling.As a tool for working out, however, I really enjoy it. I really don't like to work out. I'm not someone who is going to go out for a three mile run every day, or do a bunch of crunches for the sake of it. I need to be doing something that is fun, that takes my mind off of the fact that I'm... working out.

Mom and Dad and Kid having lots of fun.  We like the fact that the difficulty level can accommodate people of different athletic abilities.  It is a fun activity and the whole family is taking turns after dinner to do it. The cost is just a fraction of a gym membership.  There is a lot of jogging in place - this is the major exercise.  If you are not into that type of exercise or if you cannot jog in place even a little bit either because of physical limitations or the whole house shakes, this may not be for you.  You are not required to jog at a high-intensity level but you do have to do it.I feel like I am getting what I paid for.The ring is well made and it appears to be able to take a lot of pressing and pulling and other types of exercise abuse.  The grips are well made.  The whole setup is well made and shows good quality.  The parts look sturdy and look to be able to handle regular use. The game is light and it would not be too much to take it on vacation.The leg strap works well if you keep the controller straight up and down (vertical) when you are standing up.  If the controller on the leg strap is knocked off vertical, then the game would think you are not in the correct position. I tied it to the drawstring on my shorts which does a good job of preventing this slippage.  I am thinking of another way to do this but no solution yet.It can detect your pulse by contacting your thumb pad to the controller. It does not work for you. But I found out that I can use my index finger (or any other finger) instead.I will state the obvious - the controllers are not charged in the setup, therefore you have to charge them every once in a while by taking them off the ring and the strap and connecting them to a charger or to the switch console (which is a charger).

During the summer months it's easy to get out & get exercise.  No so much where I live during the winter.  Thus far, Ring Fit Adventure has been a very nice option in the comfort of my own home.  I don't have to leave the house after work in the dark & cold to go to the gym!  Beyond that, it's fun!  It gamifies fitness a lot more than Wii Fit ever did.You might ask yourself, why did you only give this product 4 stars instead of 5 if you love it so much!?!  Well, it's not perfect, & honestly it lacks a lot in terms of functionality.  It pales in comparison to to Wii Fit in terms of functionality, & will at times be completely frustrating.  One, the game wasn't designed for larger individuals, it was designed by Japanese Developers for a Japanese market -- smaller individuals.  Now mind you I'm overweight, but not obese & the problem I experience is that when you run or do anything vigorous in terms of your lower body the leg strap continually tries to slide off your leg.  I can assume this problem gets a lot worse the heavier you are, which is funny given that those are the people who need this product the most.  The leg strap should have been made out of another material.  This can be countered by strapping it to your upper thigh as tightly as possible, but that creates other problems.Two, the game has a lot of trouble trying to figure out what you are trying to do sometimes.  Sometimes it wont even pick up your actions.  I've just given up on doing any exercise that requires you do be in a prone position:  planks, push ups, & etc.  I ware myself out just trying to get the game to read my position even before I start the exercise - very frustrating.  Beyond that, if you can get it to read your position the game will not give your the appropriate score for the exercise given that it's still having difficulty reading your movement.  This may not be as bad if the leg strap is where it's supposed to be (the middle of your thigh), but then the leg strap slips off your leg.  Problems one & two really take me out of my headspace while I'm trying to exercise.  Part of me wishes they would just make ""Switch Fit"" & sell an adapter for the old Wii Fit Board.  It was A LOT more reliable in terms of functionality.Three, I'm worried that after I beat the game I'm not going to be interested in it any more.  So far it's great & mostly enjoyable, but there will come a point where I complete the main campaign.  Nintendo as a company is woefully incompetent when it comes to online functionality & support.  They are decades behind both Sony & Microsoft - especially Microsoft.  This game desperately requires post-launch DLC & support, but I don't think we're going to get it.  Just ask anyone who made the mistake of buying Super Mario Party, or anyone who is struggling with the online component of Pokemon Sword & Shield presently.  Which is a shame given that most of the charm of this product is that it is equal parts game & fitness.  In this way it is superior to Wii Fit given that it was always more fitness than game, but when you run out of ""game"" that point is moot.TL;DR -- This is a very enjoyable product that will help you loose weight if you sick with it, however, it isn't without it's frustrations & limitations.",A mostly perfect experience....,Verified Purchase,12 people found this helpful,38,8,Public,5706065

This is not a review from someone who likes or particularly wants to work out, I enjoy walking and light cardio but sweating isn't much for me. I work out so I can eat snacks and stay a size that fits into the clothes I already own, that is my motivation.That being said I quit my gym membership as I'm sure many have since the start of covid, I don't see myself going back anytime soon. To combat the lack of exercise I walk and ride a stationary bike but found my exercise to be less rounded and becoming incredibly dull unless I was playing Animal Crossing (on the bike).When I saw the Ringfit I was a bit skeptical, I never liked the Wii active games but really wanted something to show me how to exercise and motivate me to do something different. Well this was the game for me. This thing really makes you sweat and in a good way! The usual annoyance I get from targeted exercises is gone with the distractions the game gives you.I particularly enjoy the mini-games but the adventure is a lot of fun and I genuinely look forward to earning new moves. I like the fact you can add scores from  mini-games without having to individually sign in which adds another level of fun since my bf and I can both switch off and compete with each other.Haven't had the game long so I cant speak to how long it'll hook me in but so far I've had a good balance of adventure, mini games and targeted exercises when I'm looking to work out particular muscles. This is a great game for the times and I already feel like it's benefited me physically and mentally.The game tries to teach you good work out posture and it will correct you at times but it's of course not perfect so you may need to be conscious of how you move and do additional research to get the most out of your moves.If you think this will help you, it probably will I highly recommend it.",Just buy it,Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,195,98,Public,175407

If you're looking for a fun way to augment a fitness routine, buy this.I bought this initially for my kids, but I've wound up using it much more frequently than they do. I already work out regularly, but I've found that this game has given me some new and different ways of getting in some exercise. Especially during the winter months -- which is right now as I'm writing this -- the same old gym routine starts to feel like a grind. This game could not have come at a more perfect time.Above I mentioned that this is a great tool for augmenting your routine and I think it's important to expand upon that a bit. The workouts you get with this game are simply not as good as what you can do in a gym, and some of the numbers are definitely way off. For example, the game involves a lot of jogging in place and will often translate that to a ridiculous number of ""meters run."" I can jog for maybe 30 seconds and have the game tell me that I've just run 500+m. I wish I were the next Usain Bolt, but that's certainly not the case. I can easily break a sweat while playing this game, but 30 minutes of gameplay is not even close to hitting the treadmill for 30 minutes. So again, this is a fun side activity -- not the main course. (Note: I think a weighted vest could go a long way here. I've not tried it yet, though, so no comment.)The actual ""game"" portion of this game (""Adventure Mode"") is decent, if extremely repetitive. ""Battles"" involve doing lots and lots and lots of reps of various exercises and, for me at least, it gets boring quickly. My favorite way to use this is to ignore Adventure Mode altogether and instead focus on the mini games, challenges, and sets. The mini games and challenges especially are super fun and when you do a lot of them can add up to a pretty good workout. Each one takes between 30 seconds and a couple of minutes and generally works a single muscle group in a game-like format. At the end you get a ranking, on a scale of D-C-B-A-S, where S is the best. This creates a nice competition, either against yourself or against friends.I'd like to see way, way more mini games and especially challenges added to the system (there are only a handful of the latter today, mostly working the same muscle groups). And I'd love to have a two-player mode available so that e.g. I can challenge my kids in real time instead of our having to take off the leg holster every time. This could be an amazing party game with a few tweaks.Hardware-wise, the ring con is really cool and an interesting way to interact but the hardware can certainly be a lot better. First off, I really wish there were some options with regard to increasing resistance. The game handles that by increasing the number of reps, which works to some degree but gets a bit boring after a while. Second, the leg holster. This area is far less well thought out and I think there is lots of room for improvement here. I am constantly having to adjust it as it slips during various jogging exercises and if I tighten it too much it starts hitting the buttons on the joycon and the game freaks out. I think a rubberized version with a built-in joycon (sans buttons) would solve this nicely. It would of course not be free but I'm sure I'm not the only player who would be willing to invest.My final bit of feedback -- I wonder if anyone from Nintendo will even read this? -- is that community-created exercises in the form of challenges, sets, and perhaps even mini games, would really open things up and allow the platform to thrive. I feel there's a tremendous amount of potential here if Nintendo is willing to allow its users to take this to the next level.That was a long review so let me summarize: This is a fun way to get some exercise, well worth the cost in my opinion. It won't replace a ""real"" workout in a gym but it's a great add on. The hardware is innovative and interesting but there's room for improvement. And the platform itself could yield amazing things...Nintendo, I hope you're listening.Definitely recommended!",Great...

This is going to be long.Where to begin! This is more than just a game. First, it comes with a yoga resistance ring as well as a thigh holster for one of the joy cons. Each session begins with putting one joy con in the thigh holster and attaching that to your leg as well as sliding the other joy con onto the resistance ring. You also have the software. There’s a decent tutorial to get you started and on your way.I’m not going to write much about the game play, storyline, characters etc. because you can find all that and more from watching YouTube reviews of the game. In general terms, you are inserted into an RPG style game in which you are trying to defeat a muscular dragon type villain, with the help of a talking ring personal trainer. There are a lot of details, big and small, to the game, that would take for ever to write about. So I’m just going to stick to the hardware experience and why I bought it.The Hardware: 5/5This game is a terrific vehicle for showcasing the Switch’s unique hardware. It uses the vast array of sensors in each joy-con to tell the game what you are doing and where you are as you complete an exercise. Each exercise has a mini calibration before you begin. For example, the overhead press has you put your arms over your head holding the ring-con and hold that pose for a few seconds to make calibrate. Much of the game is of you jogging through the various levels and worlds. So the joy-con that’s strapped to your leg captures your movement as you jog in place. It seems somewhat accurate. There will be times where you have to high step to run through water, run up stairs, etc. So the joy con on your leg has to measure that movement to make sure you’re high stepping.The ring-con is also pretty cool. Much of the game was you, for example, pushing in the ring with both hands to maneuver the game’s menus, cycle through dialogue, selecting options on screen and so forth. It’s basically a substitution for pressing buttons*. You also use the ring-con to move through the map by twisting the rin-con left or right, lifting it over your head or moving the ring-con to face the ground. It’s also used to track arm movements as well as registering pushes and pulls on the ring-con. One other interesting feature: it utilizes the IR thing on the right joy-con to, get this, measure your heart rate. I compared it to my heart rate sensor on my fitness band and it isn’t terribly accurate. It has only given me two readings, something like 178 if I’m really working hard, or 140 for moderate exercise. I don’t believe it varies at all between those two readings. Still cool, nonetheless.*So the idea is, instead of pushing buttons on the controller to access menus, etc. you’re still doing a physical movement, in between exercises, to move through the gameplay, such as rifling through dialogue, moving through the map or menus. If you’re tired or you don’t feel like squeezing the ring-con anymore, you can always use the x,y,a,b buttons instead. As far as the left joy-con is concerned, it’s pretty much there to measure your lower body movements.The only con I have with the hardware is I’m afraid I’m going to ruin the resistance. I’m more of a strength guy versus agility. I will say this, I still get tired out doing the overhead press, but when I’m doing the downward press, the one at waist high level, it’s too easy. I’m nearly touching both hands when pressing in (squeezing in). So hooray for me I guess but I don’t want to have to buy a new ring-con.Again, if you want to know more about the game play, graphics, all of those details, you’ll get a more succinct review of that by watching a youtube video.Why I bought it:Ring Fit Adventure keeps you honest, provides manageable goals for fitness and exercising, really gives you a total workout from stretching both before and after, to working your upper and lower body as well as your core.The long and the short of it is I can’t begin to explain how well this game keeps you motivated, on track and consistently coming back to play and exercise again. It’s certainly not because of the RPG elements, its the total package. It’s a very polished tool to get in shape and enjoy doing it.Things that stand out to me:-it keeps a running timer of active exercising for each session, not just how long you’ve been playing.-It does a more than adequate job explaining each exercise, showing oyu how to do it and then making sure you’re doing it right-Again, very customizable. If it’s been too easy, it may even prompt you to ask if you want to increase the difficulty level. You can also do it manually at any time. If it’s too challenging, you can always decrease the difficulty level. It’ll at times ask or suggest you to stop, probably based off the heart rate levels. It really does stress the importance of not doing too much too early and pacing yourself.-As I’ve played more and more, I notice that certain groups of levels or worlds focus on certain movements and exercises. For instance, today I found myself doing a ton of squats and doing this one yoga pose that worked my core. Also, I've noticed the cool down stretches aren’t always the same and sometimes correspond with the previous session’s exercises. For example, if most of the exercises I was doing concern themselves with arms, the static stretching at the end made sure they stretched my arms out. In other words, the exercises and stretches have been very purposeful so far.-I really do get a good sweat going and find myself tired afterwards. I’ve always had trouble pushing myself at the gym to the point of being really tired. So I think this game does a good job of making sure your time exercising was well worth it.-although not too useful to me, but certainly applicable to young children, the game offers several varieties of tips and healthy suggestions towards proper nutrition, sleep, exercise habits and so forth that would be valuable to people who are still learning those things.Things I don’t like:-Uneven exercise reps. Due to the nature of the game, as youre battling a foe, that bad guy may be at less than full health. Okay and you choose an exercise to finish him off. There are some exercises where you switch from one side of the body to the other, like the Warrior Pose #1. Today i found myself defeating a foe before I was able to switch from the left to the right side of my body, As a result, only my left side got the workout. It was a bit uneven. Now, im sure I could have paused the game and finished the set, but I was engulfed in the game and wanted to finish the battle.-Kills your joy-con batteries. And I believe my right joy con’s battery has been used more than the left one.-Not sure of the durability of the ring-con. Like I said before, its fairly easy to push in the ring-con where my left and right knuckles almost touch. It would be cool if they could offer replacement ring-cons that have greater resistance.-only a one player game. Other people can play it, but it has to be on their own profile. Maybe they could offer some DLC that has minigames that are multi-player. Not sure howd that work.","from novice to pro, RIng Fit Adventure will challenge anyone to be their best",Verified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,366,76,Public,201132

But ring fit adventure was, to be blunt, boring.There are 20 ""worlds"" you have to complete, but the levels in each world are literally repeats of each other, so there's nothing new to see past world 3. The story is bare-bones and doesn't entice me to play further. The minigames aren't challenging or fun. You also HAVE to grind to progress, so all in all there's a lot of repetition for little payoff.If you're looking for a game that is fun and distracts you from exercise, look elsewhere. This less of a game and more of a fantasy-themed fitness routine. That said, for what it is, it works well--that's why I gave it three stars instead of none.","It's a game for fitness people, not fitness for game people.",Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,19,9,Public,4207439

I bought Ring Fit Adventure to augment my daily walks with the goal of obtaining/maintaining enough strength and flexibility to be comfortable and capable througout my daily life.I'm up to Day 55, World 13 and I'm having a blast! I use it every day for between 12 - 15 minutes of workout (which actually takes me about 45 minutes or so because it also includes dynamic stretching and static stretching before and after the timed workout, and of course there's a little reading and other game play things to do). I stop mostly when the game suggests. I always monitor my heart rate (I really appreciate that feature) and the game is giving my heart a 'moderate' workout which I like: Enough to build stamina but not so much that I fall over in a faint. I continue to have muscles that ache in my arms, legs, back and stomach. I have noticed that my posture, flexibility and balance have improved, as has my energy level. And I have not gotten injured.So, why has this been effective? Well, here are some of the things I like:* My brain has something to focus on besides 'reps'. The game laces in fun challenges, like completing a jog without encountering any monsters, or determining the best set of exercises to take into a monster fight (legs, arms, abs, yoga...), some exercises are effective against just one monster at a time, while others do multi-monster damage... there's stuff to think about!* I like how accurate the ring-con and leg-con seem to be. If I'm duffing it, the game gives suggestions (""It won't be as effective with bent elbows...""), but it took a little trial-and-error to figure out why sometimes I'd just get a ""Good!"" instead of a ""Great!"" hit with some of the exercises.* I like that the adventure blends aerobics (jogging in place) with yoga and calisthenics, focusing on different areas of the body (which is my choice because I have selected some exercises from each category).* I like that it started me out at a low level (so I didn't get hurt) that was still fun, so I was motivated to keep on playing.* I like that I get to pick the exercises that I'll be using: If I want to focus on upper body today ('cuz yesterday's squats got me!), I can and that's better than skipping the whole thing.* I enjoy the mini-games! Things like blasting crates by squeezing on the ring con is so much fun that I completely forget that I'm exercising.There are several exercises that I have unlocked that I still cannot do correctly, so that means I have room to grow - not just in the number of reps, but in techniques.Yes, I found the voice of the Ring character to be annoying sometimes - so I turned the volume down on it. I didn't mute, though, because he does give decent feedback during the actual exercises (really helpful for those exercises where I can't see the TV).NOTE: I think I was too tentative when I first set it up - afraid I'd snap the ring or something - and after a couple of weeks I began to notice that I was beating all the monsters and never needing to power-up (no smoothies). I bumped my 'level' several times (the game started me at level one and I'm now at level 8 (I think it goes all the way to level 30!)), but still, it seemed off. I decided to re-calibrate both ring-con and leg-con. Sure enough, the workouts got more intense because it knows that my arms and legs are actually stronger than they appeared back on day one.UPDATE: I am up to day 77 and am six pounds lighter, and two inches smaller around my waist.

Great tips to help your form and good little bits of nutrition info and other basics to help keep you motivated and on track. Also works great when you’re just chilling watching TV, you don’t even need to be at your switch to get some reps and in-game rewards.

I have never liked to run in any setting. There have been times when I've enjoyed other types of exercising, but before buying this game I was doing 0 mins a day. Between the great visuals, the fun story and mechanics and the customizable aspects, I immediately changed my mentality and became very enthusiastic about fitness. I saw physical changes in my body (inches lost, muscles showing) before I lost any weight, but I eventually lost a few pounds too. You can be as casual or intense with this as you want. The main story is broken up into short levels, and during the levels you can pause or stop and go back if you need to. You can also repeat levels you like. The 'battles' are turn based (they wait) and you can go at your own pace doing the exercises.My boys just turned 7 and 4 and they are literally underfoot sometimes, but I am still able to get it done. They both play some too! The 7 year old doesn't like exercise, but enjoys this and can do everything on his own. The 4 year old can do the jogging courses. My husband had surgery and could only intermittently (and lightly) use this, but still enjoys it.It took me around 75ish days to complete the story line. After that, 'new' levels open up, which seem to be repeating the original levels but with new dialogue and obviously level appropriate mobs.Custom Mode allows you to create a fitness list of exercises that you can save and perform any time. It's a more 'focused' workout and you can change the number of reps and string different styles of play (rhythm game, jogging, specific exercises for targeted areas). Quick Play has preset challenges, minigames and targeted sets to choose individually. There are other cool features but I don't use them much yet.More of my favorite things about this game:-It's user friendly and flexible-cool visuals-tracks your time moving, calories burned, and km run and shows it in real time-has an avatar performing the exercises at the same time to give you a visual help-has sounds and verbal prompts to indicate when you're not doing an exercise correctly-rarely 'forces' you to do specific exercises and does have a help function if you are unable to-can be challenging but isn't a beat down-allows you to pause and walk off at any time-allows you to customize the difficulty as you go (which will increase/decrease reps)-slowly introduces gameplay mechanics (not overwhelming)I wish this game had continued support and DLC.

I was pretty disappointed in the game once we started. This is one of those expensive and fancy games that sounds good in theory but will end up on the floor of your closet.User interface: somewhat complicated and hard to adjust to. Shifting up and down on menus with the ringcon only is a PAIN (it always goes to the bottom or top option automatically because it is too sensitive).Graphics: no matter what personalized look you choose, you won’t see it in the cutscenes. Then why bother changing your avatar’s hair color, etc.? Otherwise, graphics are fine.Workout Level: the “moderate” workout is actually pretty exhausting (I workout on an exercise bike 3-5x/week at moderate tension) and felt lightheaded/had a headache after 15 minutes of the moderate levels. I STRONGLY suggest you start at casual.Gameplay: starts out fun because of the novelty of the game (jogging through a fantasy world and doing squeezes and moves to “jump”, then fighting bosses with turn-based combat in which you perform about 5 different exercises—just one at a time) but VERY quickly this becomes tedious and I mean within a few levels. There just isn’t enough variation to make this game interesting after you’ve played the first few levels. Someone pointed out this isn’t a game for people who are sedentary gamers who want to exercise, but is more of a game for moderate fitness people who just want a hint of entertainment with their workout. But the problem is this isn’t even an aerobic workout because you stop after certain points and switch to other moves during boss battles, between levels having to watch cutscenes, etc. It’s very frustrating.Personally, I expected more when I saw the rave reviews. Yes, I’ve only played for the first few levels, bit and I’ll drop it down to casual and see if that makes a difference, but as of now, this game seems really overrated and overhyped. Again, your family will probably play it for awhile during the holidays after they open it and then never play it again, and it’s too expensive to make that worth it.Spend your money on an Exerpeutic foldable exercise bike that faces the TV and you’re far better off and more likely to get your exercise in than playing this tedious game.","Overpriced and overrated, tedious",Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,130,55,Public,610978

I like how it has story mode (which is surprisingly compelling) as well as a mode where you can put together your own exercise regimen. The level up system is very intricate, and power ups are neat and fun to collect, though some level grinding will be necessary to unlock everything. But that just means more exercise, which, for the most part (see drawbacks in the next paragraph) is a lot of fun. Plus, the community for this game (the sub reddit especially) in addition to the game itself are very supportive and helpful. The graphics are also beautiful, particularly during sunrise and sunset environments. The enemy selection is cute, being modeled after gym equipment.Drawbacks are that some of the exercises don't register with the motion controls at times (mountain climbers, deep squats, and basically any stuff that requires the joy con leg strap tend to have some difficulties), so that can get frustrating, especially if you're trying to 100% the game. Some of the minigames are fine (destroying crates by blasting air from the ring con is very satisfying), but others are a mixed bag (aerochute is a good workout, but not much fun, and squattery wheel is finicky). The rhythm game is a fun idea, but the execution is just okay, not amazing, but fine for a couple of rounds before moving on to a different exercise. Also, the game tends to reuse entire levels a lot, so there is an issue with environment variety. But at least the enemy selection is varied, so it doesn't feel like a slog to get through repeat levels.While the issues above seem overwhelming, they don't detract from the experience overall. Despite a few flaws here and there, this game is a whole lot of fun and makes exercise feel like fun rather than an obligation.","Ring Fit Adventure, though not flawless, makes exercising actually fun.",Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,4,2,Public,9398678

We got it on release day and we have played it every day since. We started with the mini games to learn the technique and find the difficulty level that was best for us. I’m 50 years old and my son is 16, and we both love it. The adventure mode is difficult at times, even for me and I’m someone who has had a professional trainer in the past. Wow it really works the muscles and you’ll feel it the next day. Unless you’ve got the ring set to easy (or whatever be lowest level is). My son normally sits playing BOTW or the new Dragon Quest for switch, but this has got him off the couch - active AND fighting enemies. Each world has new challenges and you can earn more attack modes which are different workout moves. I’m definitely looking forward to getting some new clothing later in the game because I’m not a fan of orange. :) And we also like the “free” mode or whatever it is called where you can use the ring to do arm of leg work and it keeps track (handy while watching a tv show) then when you turn your switch on and go into the game you select which player gets awarded the points you earned from your reps. So much more to come, I know we’ll be enjoying this for a long time. If you love video games that are challenging and want to get a good workout in with room for improvement and challenges, this so for you. Even the cool downs are geared toward what workouts you chose in your attack modes. So if you did more arm work, the cool down will focus on your arms more. I could go in and on about this game and we’ve only had it 5 days!

I've been a runner for about 10 years, and I have been doing CrossFit for 1.5 years. I saw a lot of reviews of beginners really enjoying this (and I will say if you set to an easier difficulty, I think this is excellent for beginners). But I set it to a level 26 difficulty, and selected that I wanted an ""intense"" workout and damn. That's definitely what I got.I love the game portion of it and how you complete different levels in each world, and the monsters you come across on the way. It's so much fun to run through the different levels and collect ingredients and coins, and to be challenged on a specific body part depending on the monster's color.And the boss battles are fun, too! This game isn't just exercising for the sake of exercising, you have to have strategy, too and some aim (which I am not always the best at) but it makes it feel like you're playing a game of Mario or something similar.And this workout burns about just as many calories as an hour of Crossfit does (when I do it for a full hour) according to my watch.Overall, I'd highly recommend you get this game regardless of your fitness level. I suggested it to a friend of mine who's completely sedentary and needs motivation to workout and she's really enjoying it. It's very adaptive and you can make it as difficult or as easy as you want to, and you still get to move your body and get healthier which is the most important thing!

As of writing this, it's in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, so going to the gym is out of the question and can't get a personal trainer, so this seemed like a great idea for an adaptive and fun exercise regiment.And it is!What I've heard most about Ring Fit is it's kinda tough, which is true starting out. However I've been doing this for four days and have been able to increase the difficulty a little and comforably double my workout time today, so I feel it's built me up very quickly (not that I'm going for longer than 30 min ever, or that I'm suddenly swol). When you start out, it asks you about your age and weight, how much you exercise already, and how much of a workout you want, as well as gauges your push and pull strength, to give you an appropriate workout regiment. It also frequently reminds you to take breaks, hydrate, and to not over-do it. I did over-do it once, so I just hit the ""cool down"" button, which brings you to the finishing stretches, as well as shows you your progress and a brief lesson on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle.The Pilates ring is very sturdy! I was worried it would be kinda flimsy as it's a video game pack-in, but it's clearly meant to handle the abuse for years to come. The leg strap could be bigger in my opinion; I'm not a big person at all, but have very large thighs, and have trouble getting it to fit nicely. Above all the motion controls are very responsive and accurate, to the point I nearly forgot to mention it as you're never given any reason to think about it; it's just smooth and accurate. Also really love how the IR sensor on the right joycon reads your pulse! It's a little wonky, usually takes a couple tries to get it to read a steady pulse, but really cool none the less.I haven't ventured much past the main campaign, but it has A LOT of bonus material. There are several minigames(my favorite is Thigh Rider which, as you can guess, targets your thighs), sets to workout various areas, virtual jogging paths, a ""multitask"" mode which you can workout on your own with the ring without using the screen and it records your progress, and targeted workouts for specifit muscle groups. Haven't yet dipped into the Custom Workout, but intend to in the next few days.I absolutely can't recommend this enough to anyone who wants to get into working out and is having trouble finding the motivation. I have ADHD so creating new habits can be really hard, so it's often necessary to gameify things like this so I can be motivated to continue with it. Trouble is it can be a little too fun sometimes and can be hard to walk away from when you get worn-out, so absolutely make sure to supervise any children who might be using this (or housemate with ADHD lol).I feel this is a very good tool for working out, and comes at a very reasonable MSRP (got mine for $70). Hope this review helps, and I hope this tool helps as many people as possible!EDIT: I lost a pound after a week of use! Granted I've got a fast metabolism (when it works right, got Hashimoto's disease so not always the case), and I've adopted a high-protein diet, so results will vary. This is exciting for me because, largely due to factors caused by the pandemic and chronic illness, I'm about 10 pounds overweight.

Here is why:1.) on the main adventure game you will consistently have to do a set of exercises that are exactly the same and results in the same thing on screen. For example, you're only allowed to select 6 different basic exercises per level and once you select that you will be doing these 6 exercises for 20-40 minutes depending on what level you are on.2.) Again, only 6 specific exercises allowed over the 40+ exercises in the game. Why cant it let us choose from all 40 exercises and instead restrict us to just 6.3.) Each level is just exactly the same thing but just shorter or longer. I remember the XBOX connect game xbox adventures and that was so interesting because you were always doing something different and fun. This is just running in place seeing the exact same scenery.4.) Workout to the music: they really need to expand this selection. My current selection is basic theme songs and even some melancholy songs which are not interesting or easy to dance to. Obviously this is not ""just dance"" on switch but I expected better.5.) overall the game does teach you good posture but horrible technique for in-game exercise moves. For example squatting, for entry players and experienced you will have to squat a lot but the game doesn't really teach you the correct form at all which is VITAL for the exercise to work properly.

Until the pain in shoulder began.Here's the unfortunately reality of this - you WILL get injured if you're not VERY careful. It's a game, so it might seem ridiculous to some that a game will A) give you an intense workout and B) can injure you in any capacity. Just like a ""real"" workout, this WILL make you sweat and be intense at times.The game is almost TOO reliant in making EVERYTHING a workout, without checking in enough to see if you're OK. You squeeze the included tension wheel too much in too many different ways to really be safe (and you need to squeeze it A LOT, for example when you're creating items) especially for a beginner just getting into working out again. Also, it doesn't take any injuries into account. For example, when my shoulder began hurting badly (turns out it was a rotator cuff injury from playing this game) there was no way to totally avoid using your shoulders or arms. I also have bad knees, but the game doesn't take that into account when judging your form. It's not your typical ""do your best until you can do better"" it's ""do exactly the way we show or else you'll likely fail"". This was disheartening as I couldn't properly do squats as deep as they wanted so my ""moves"" always failed, and the enemies would defeat me.  Don't get me wrong, I liked pushing myself, but the game forced me into pushing too hard. Eventually I stopped because my injuries were getting more severe. And honestly I was too afraid to start up again for fear of further injury.If you're more experienced at working out, this can be a great supplement. And it's FUN don't get me wrong.

More specifically, this game will immediately aim for your knees, quads, and hamstring muscles with squats, yoga poses, high knees, leg lifts, and jogging in place.

Like any new thing, I was much more eager in the beginning at the chance to get healthier than I am now. The game doesn't push you to keep coming back to play. And while some people may be disappointing, I have found it much better for myself in the long term.RFA is much more of a game than past fitness Nintendo games have been. Instead of holding a wiimote and using a balance board you have a legstrap and the ring-con (pilates band) to create the movements of your character on screen. It has a basic story and plays on quite a few RPG tropes, but does so in a way that makes you get that little bit of escapism that can keep your mind from associating the game from a hard workout when you're pushing to get those last set of knee lift combos in. You still know you're exercising, but you're doing it towards a tangible goal of finishing a level, defeating a boss, or completing a sidequest for a cool reward.One of the big things about RFA is that it doesn't push you to keep going. It'll offer an alarm to set a routine, but doesn't bug you past the first mention. After about 10 minutes of active time (upon finishing whatever level you're on) it'll offer that you've done well for the day and can stop if you wish. It reminds you not to push yourself to exercise if you're feeling sore (believe me, as a sedentary person before this you likely will be). This lets you really know that you are in control, and that for me, the game understands that you can be busy or not in the right form to jump in for another day. I don't feel bad for missing a few days, because I know when I jump back in the game will drop me in where I was and let me continue pushing forward.I do think you'll get a heck of a lot more out of the game if you collaborate with friends. I'm definitely motivated to keep going when I see my friends post their summary sheet detailing their exercise time and calories burned for the day. We bemoan over the dreadmills and squat swings. We celebrate each other's wins. And it's honestly great to have.I'm also happy to have an alternative to a gym membership. Instead of feeling bad for not going somewhere enough due to paying a monthly fee, I have this sitting in my living room, fully paid for up front, ready to do a quick workout after a long day at work. As someone who has struggled with wait, bullying, and lack of physical exercise growing up, knowing I can be comfortable in my home and get a great workout is huge. It hasn't turned me into any kind of gym rat, but I can definitely feel my body getting a little stronger and more in shape, which makes me very happy.tl;dr The game won't push you to exercise, but it's gorgeous and well thought out to let you do it at your own pace whenever you're ready.",A great tool to help you exercise,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,37,10,Public,2280728

I will update my review as soon as i play for about a month or 2.First things first, the box art and presentation is stunning. The colors are bright which really makes u want to purchases and try out the game. If you bought it online, you'd be surprised to how beautiful and amazing it looks. :)The inside presentation was nice as well. The game and ring con was safely held in place with a thick orange cardboard like material so nothing will be moving around and/or damaged during its journey to get to you.The leg band seems to hold really well around your thigh. However, if you work out with pants, you may need to adjust it a bit tighter to keep it from slipping. For those of you concerned, the leg band is long and does stretch quite alot so that is a huge plus if you are having doubts of picking this up just because of that reason :)Last but not least, the ring con. The ring con looks cheap in videos reviews due to people easily pushing and pulling despite some never really working out in their lives so i thought it was gonna be easy to do the same but i was wrong xD I knew right away that Nintendo did not use cheap material for this thing because it was harder to pull the ring con than to push it. It will most likey losen up over time but for now it feels really sturdy so no one should be afraid to think its gonna break anytime soon xDOverall, this is really worth the $87 (with tax) that i spent. I know it may seem like a lot of money but its cheaper for those people who pay for a gym membership that they rarely or just never go to xD personally, i hate working out in public so this game is a really big plus for me to have and i cant wait for my arms and legs to feel like noodles because this game is gonna slowly kill me. But like the saying goes: no pain, no gain.I dont know if Nintendo actually reads these reviews but i personally want to thank them for releasing this game right before the holidays along with Luigi's Mansion 3, Pokemon Sword and Shield, Link's Awakening, and a bunch of others. Without this game, i would have turned into a big time couch potato and most likey gain more weight with all the turkey and tamales xD",Good Presentation! :),Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,50,38,Public,2469706

There's a decent amount of different excercises to try so you rarely are forced to do any that you don't like or are too hard for you.I will say that it's a bit difficult to hold the ringcon for a few keg excercises without having to support it with your hand. Apparently standard Pilates rings are slightly curved at the handles to make it easier to hold between your thighs, but the ringcon's handles are not. Not a huge deal.

You squeeze on the ring fit to ""air blast"" things near you (ie: open a door, break a box).  You pull on the ring fit to ""vacuum"" things (ie: bring coins to you), and also to jump (you blast downwards for this).  Most of the time, you don't actually NEED to do this, but I find it fun to try to collect all of the items so I could level up sooner.I find the direction controls annoying.  For example, if something is located at the 10 O'Clock position from me, it's hard to judge where to point the ring fit in order to actually blast that exact direction.  I'm only on day 2 though, so it's quite possible that I'll get better at this as time goes on.The game also has monsters that you have to beat.  This is done with ""exercise contest"" in an RPG style.  You can either choose the attack that you wish to use, or use a random one.  You will then need to do a set of that chosen exercise, and the monster's health bar will decrease.  You then choose the next attack.  Most monsters need at least 2-3 different exercises.As your level rises, you gain more hearts, more attack damage & defend power, and more exercises to use in the battles.My 8 year old son is also enjoying this game quite a bit.  The game chose our starting strength level automatically based on our ages, some easy questions (do you exercise right now or not?), and how strong our initial ""squeeze"" of the ring fit was.  As far as I could tell, the strength level is the amount of reps you have to do for each exercises in the monster battles.I hate exercising, but this feels more like a game and I don't really think of it as hard work (even though I do feel sore after using it)I recommend this to anyone who wants to work out, without feeling like they're working out.",Fun workout game,Verified Purchase,,918,428,Public,405316

I was most interested in seeing if the main adventure would be engaging enough to keep me regularly jogging (in place), since I normally hate the monotony of cardio exercise. I wouldn't say that Ring Fit is an incredible game on it's own (the dialogue and storyline are pretty cheesy and it's no BOTW lol) but I would say it very successfully combined basic RPG mechanics with different types of exercise, and I found myself actually enjoying working out problem areas like abs and pecs in order to defeat monsters and progress through the levels.In terms of hardware, the ring-con is quite stiff + durable and I did experience muscle soreness after using it for things like chest presses (I'm not a body-builder or anything though so maybe take this with a grain of salt). The leg strap and ring con grips are also washable - I put them in a delicates bag to machine wash (although Nintendo says you're supposed to hand wash), and then left them to air-dry.It was also pretty nice to see the different gameplay modes besides the main adventure that you could use to create custom workouts, as well as a multi-tasking mode where the joy-con actually records up to 500 reps if you want to do them while watching Netflix or something (very targeted UX design on Nintendo's part lol)Really liking the game and the feeling of working out regularly!",Great exercise gamification,Verified Purchase,,69,56,Public,86722104

Gameplay is centered around running through levels, collecting coins and other items, interacting with a wide variety of decidedly fitness inspired contraptions, and fighting enemies in a turn-based-RPG style battle system.Battles and simple movement through the world has you doing tons of different types of exercises, from squats and knee lifts, to planks and scissor kicks - from tricep kickbacks and bow pulls, to tree pose and warrior pose.  There's a huge variety of exercises to do and the game systems encourage you not to just stick to ones you find easy, while at the same time having a very comprehensive and customizable 'assist mode' which allows you to skip anything that you may not being to do.  The whole game really does a great job of adapting to your current level of fitness.  Before you start, the game calibrates your running speed, your pushing and pulling strength, takes your age, weight (optional), how fit you are compared to your age group, and how intense of an experience you want and works out an optimal difficulty for you. At the lowest difficulties, even those who do not work out at all will be able to keep up.  And at the highest difficulties, those who work out quite a bit will find their heart rate elevated.  The game also slowly encourages you to increase the difficulty, but has enough of a gradient that increasing the difficulty by one level isn't too bad.  One month later though, you realize you're doing twice the number of reps for an exercise as when you started and it feels really good.The game's RPG elements are light compared to other non-fitness games, but are surprisingly expansive for a fitness game.  You have a level up system, multiple-enemy hitting attacks, type weaknesses, recovery and buffing items, debuffs, a skill tree, metroidvania-esque movement unlocks, towns, clothing options, and more!  And most impressively, everything is unlocked at a slow enough pace that even if you're not familiar with RPG games, you will not get lost.Pretty much everything in the game is inspired by fitness - You have enemies based on kettlebells, springboards which fling you through the air after a squat, and fitness related puns apleantly.  The whole presentation is a bit cheesy, but is quite charming and funny.There are a few points where the game falls short.  For one, tutorial messages get repeated A LOT.  Motion control detection is by-in-large fantastic, but there are a few exercises for which the detection seems to be consistently off.If you're on the fence about getting Ring Fit Adventure, know this - It is a wonderful motivating device to get you moving.  If you've ever spent a ton of money on a gym membership as part of a New Year's Resolution, only to stop going before the end of the month, this might just be the game for you.",Fantastic fitness experience,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,55,10,Public,2989393

Especially in the winter, it's not great to throw on a podcast, get outside, and get a 4 mile walk in.  After hearing lots of positive reviews for this game, I decided to give Ring Fit a chance.Pros:+ The game is fun!  This really does make exercising fun, which is critical to whether you keep this up or not.+ I work up an intense sweat when I play this, and the adjustable difficulty allows me to make workouts as easy or intense as I want.+ The ring itself is extremely durable, far more durable than I was expecting.  It even has a decent amount of resistance to it.  I also never had issues.Cons:- There's no incentives to diversify your workouts too much.  What I mean by that is that at some point, you end up using the same small group of exercises over, and over, and over again.  This excludes other exercises that work other muscle groups, just because there's no incentives (or even drawbacks for using the same exercise too much) to use different exercises.- Joycon detection can be an absolute pain on some workouts.  This can result in perfect streaks broken, poor form to get them detected, and just a lot of annoyance in general.Verdict - If you're looking for a new, fun way to burn calories and get active, I'd give this game my vote!

The very first day, I was surprised to find that I was really working up a sweat. But, that's the point! I can sign on and do some fun mini games for a warmup or get into a real groove and workout for an hour. It's definitely more strength-focused than cardio unless you really get into the jogging in place.4) Reinforcing and positive--I smile every time it tells me ""Your sweat is so shiny and beautiful!"" I appreciate how long the game actually is--I'm on day 24 and know that there are still months more of the adventure. It celebrates the little successes every day, from hitting a new record on a mini game to a benchmark number of reps on an exercise. It's also brilliant in that you level up quickly (I usually aim for 5 levels a day), and leveling up leads to good rewards with skill points that allow you to increase your stats.The pricetag may be a bit intimidating, but I think that it's absolutely worthwhile for anyone looking for a fun, rewarding, and sustainable way to get more active.",Wonderful Fitness Game!!!,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,6,8,Public,12909344

I'll rephrase that, exercising with this game changer. I've had a goal of losing weight and becoming healthier for the last 10 years and today, I'm happy to say I'm getting there.I began mid-December 2019 and so far I've lost 22kgs (48 pounds). I'm halfway through my end goal and I will do my best to update this review around March 2021, hoping to bring bigger numbers :)Back when I started, I played the game from 3 to 4 times every week for between 10 to 15 minutes of effective work out time (not to be confused with total session time, which was around 25 to 30 minutes). Combined with a new eating plan from my nutritionist, I began losing between 2 to 3 pounds on a monthly basis.I'll admit it, I got tired of the game after 6 months of constant weekly use and began looking for alternative options to do exercise  like jogging outside. At first, the jogging was going very well, but I soon realized my weight loss started slowing down. After that, I came back to the game and I'm glad I did! I now do between 18 to 25 minutes of effective exercise having sessions of around 45-50 minutes.I haven't finished the main story, I'm on world 21 and have read there are 23 worlds, so I should be completing it within the next 2 weeks.The purchase of this game was completely worth it, specially now that most of us should try to stay home and avoid places like the gym.It's fun how my body starts asking me to play this game during the week, it's an amazing and a fun exercise. I feel you're really in control of how much you have to push yourself and the feeling afterwards is very rewarding.I thank Nintendo for this amazing game, I love the story, the progression system, game play, graphic, battles and I hope that they'll at some point release a DLC with more of it!",A game changer,Verified Purchase,,4,23,Public,15742600

If you have a certain exercise equipped that you reeaally don't like doing, you can replace it with another exercise and sort of craft your own unique routine.The mini games also offer an exciting diversion from doing calisthenics and yoga all the time. They really get you moving and take full advantage of the six axis motion sensors in the joycons.If you've never exercised before, this game is the kick in the butt that will get you started off enjoying fitness. If you're already very fit, this game is a great diversion from traditional exercise and can be supplemented into your routine easily.If you're looking to bulk up or gain weight, look elsewhere, regular gameplay will build lean and defined muscles long term.

Already both of my roommates are using it, and everyone loves the thing. Wii Fit was a silly distraction that was good enough to convince me to do some extra workouts, but this thing is serious--using the Pilates ring was an inspired choice. We'll be using this for a while, and it's well worth every dollar.I've been steadily losing weight with a few different programs over the last year, and have lost about 40 lbs; my usual routine now is to do a 5x5 three times a week, and to run ~20-25 minutes twice a week. I figured this would be amusing enough to convince me to do a sixth day, and I can already tell it's much better than that--this won't replace my 5x5, but it definitely might replace my runs, at the very least for the snowy season. It keeps my heart rate around 120-130, it combines yoga and pilates strength exercises, and (most importantly) it gets you to just forget you're working out altogether. Somehow the minute-to-minute gameplay is just so weirdly compelling you don't want to stop. I've completely blown out this week and I *actually wish I could go play it more.*The story mostly stays out of the way (other than the random fitness jokes), which is a good choice for now, but I massively hope this sells well enough to justify Nintendo doing more with it and not treating it as a second thought. I'd much rather have the chance to build a character in one of Nintendo's actual properties (really, *any* of them), and I hope they realize exercises don't have to be 1:1 with your character's actions.

(There is a new game+ and the option to 100% the old world as well as activities outside the main adventure, so I'm still able to keep playing!)I'll try to keep this short because there's a lot I want to say.I've always had a horrible relationship with exercise due to abuse, bullying, fatphobia, ED, etc.I bought this game not just because of the ongoing pandemic, but my immense discomfort with the atmosphere in public gyms.Previous exercise games I've owned have shamed me for missing days, not exercising as much as they want, etc. Being weighed in Wii Fit and told I was overweight while I had an ED was so damaging to me.Ring Fit does none of those things. It encourages you to exercise within your limits, take breaks if you need to (whether that means in the middle of a session or skipping a couple of days,) and doesn't shame you in any way, not even unintentionally. When I took a multiple week long break from the game after a hospital visit, I was so relieved when the game didn't even mention it at all. They trust you to know what's best for your body.They have a diverse set of exercises to get you through this exercise-based RPG game. Between the battles with enemies, the pretty landscapes, and minigames, you'll be too focused on the gameplay to get lost in your own mind. They encourage you to set reasonable short-term goals, eat healthy outside the game, etc. I couldn't tell you how much weight I've lost since I started playing since, again, past history with an ED, but I can tell you that I am at least happier with my body when I look in the mirror, I have more stamina, I feel more flexible, etc.Don't get me wrong, this game isn't perfect. Especially as someone whose been playing videogames for 2 decades, I've noticed some areas which lack polish, the story is corny, etc. But first and foremost, this game is about exercise, so those details didn't impact my overall score.If there's anything I really had to complain about for this game, it's the fact that you can put an assist mode on all of one type of exercise (legs, abs, arms), but not individual ones. I have poor leg muscles, but I can handle *most* of the leg exercises. I also want to be able to do most of them so I can build up strength in my weakest body parts, but there are specific exercises that I really struggle with and I wish I could put the assist option on only those ones.",Repaired My Relationship with Exercise,Verified Purchase,,10,12,Public,10049473

The scenery is fun and interactive. To mix it up there are encounters with cute little monsters (they have resemblance to gym equipment) you have to defeat them to progress the story- save villagers, collect items,stop the big bad buff dragon and so on.In order to combat the critters- you choose exercises (and it’s nice to have them separated into categories - arms- torso- legs - yoga)The exercises are assigned stats that will do a certain amount of damage if performed correctly. Kind of a turn based combat system like final fantasy or dungeons and dragons.Anyway the moves are real life exercises- mountain climbers, leg lifts, squats(so many squats!!) and various yoga moves.Which makes it more rewarding as you can apply those moves in the gym and actually see progress.The game has a helper called till that will show you how to do the move off to the side and what muscles you’ll be working for that exercise.The ring you manipulate- it’s flexible and extremely durable acts as a guide for your movements and in game as a coach, guide and cheerleader.I could go on and on…But I’ll leave my review of the best purchase I be made this year here.I wish you the best of luck and hope you decide on purchasing this game.

The ring itself is very sturdy, as its build in game to tell you to push and pull the ring but after a few reps with that thing, your body will shake a bit, as your muscles are getting tired.My first run with this, the day after, my muscles were aching the next day. I do not exercise at all and I was tired by the first world. I was only on the average difficulty. I watch a review on youtube and the hardest difficulty is killer!I would recommend if you have a hard wood floor to get a mat, to help cushion your feet, and your running shoes.Overally an excellent game for light-mid weight exercise that works on your whole body, reminds you to drink water and take breaks, and a good trick for exercise.",Love it!,Verified Purchase,,139,25,Public,228681

I don’t want to spoil anything about the gameplay, but the fact that you stretch to warm up and cool down has helped me substantially, especially as an artist with poor posture/aches/etc. At times, especially if your difficulty is high you sure will know you’re exercising.
