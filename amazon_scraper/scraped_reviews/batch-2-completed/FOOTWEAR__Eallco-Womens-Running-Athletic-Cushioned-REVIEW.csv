I had originally wanted to order more saucony socks that look almost just like these .  But the Sauconys did not all have the vibrant colors on the little cuff.  Half were just black.These have really nice fabric-  they are really soft and nice and thick.  They seem very well made and I was totally thrilled with the quality and feel.I wear a size 8.5-9 shoe and these fit me perfectly.  However due to the shape I think they would be too big for someone with like a size 6.5 shoe or smaller.  I didn’t really have to stretch them to get them on.The big bummer came after I put them on and walked around. They were so comfy and soft and thick.... and this freakin tight little band is cutting into the front on my ankles with every step.  It feels like they inserted a thin 1/4” elastic band around the top edge of the ankle.It’s uncomfortable and annoying and too tight.  With every step I can feel it cutting across the individual tendons the house through my ankle and it’s intolerable.  For the record I am a tad over 5’2” and 135.So . Sadly I must return them. They came so close to being my everything,Perfect- except for one deal breaker,Color: Black 6 (Women Shoe Size: 7-10)Verified Purchase,125 people found this helpful,"1,551",298,Public,36011.0

That's okay though, they're just socks and most of it will be covered by my shoe. I wish that was my biggest worry, what other people think about my socks!.... lol.  I own Bombas, and these are similar in compression and fit, but do sit a little higher on the ankle. The top of the sock rests at the top of my ankle bone, as expected. For the price, they are a solid group of socks and I would recommend them. 4 stars for now until I've washed them a few times to see how the stitching holds up. Will update rating once they've been broken in a bit.It's been enough time to give my follow up review now. Have washed them over a couple dozen times, and they've held up great!

However, the look isn't enough to sell me on a product, but comfort and fit definitely is.  They are soft, fit great without moving around and causing issues with my feet, and they have a great cushion on the top of the heel to prevent chafing.  They don't slip down into my shoe, bunch at the toes or any of the other problems I have had with other socks that have resulted in a trip to the podiatrist.

Now I throw them in with any load and dry them on whatever heat I need for the major load, and they don't shrink, at all.  I love these socks... and I'm picky about socks.
