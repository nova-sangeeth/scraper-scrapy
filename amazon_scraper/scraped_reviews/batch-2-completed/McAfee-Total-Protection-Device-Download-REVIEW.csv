SO SO SO obnoxious.  It decided to change my default browser to Yahoo.  Okay, well you can switch it back, right?  Sure, but it's going to nag you to re-enable it on like a weekly basis.  I ended up uninstalling and regretting I ever wasted money on this.The whole point of trying to protect your computer is that I want to do what I WANT to do, not have pop ups, not have some software I'm not trying to run steal all resources and make the things I want to do go slower.  It just ruins your computer, steals your time, runs programs you don't want at bad times, opens windows you didn't ask for, and generally takes control of your computer while booting you to the role of supplicant having to ask its permission to do anything.

I'm sorry I made that decision as both Avast and Malwarebytes functioned well and kept my PC protected. Also, I was able to load both programs and a couple other offerings I tested seamlessly and with no issues. Unfortunately, I did not do a pre-test with McAfee and paid for it. It took me over 6 hours of my time and 2 sessions with McAfee support to finally get a successful install. The MacAfee ""100% percent, we're with you all the way"" satisfaction promise is a complete joke. After they gave up on me I had to do a couple hours of research to address the issues they could not help me with. I think that any low level tech support person could have at least pointed me in the direction of resolving the issues I had, but McAfee could not. I had to go through several cleanup and removal operations, (along with some other actions), and load the software as an administrator. What a nightmare. The load on my Mac went OK but the functioning seems to be a bit flakey. Because of the time I've invested, I'm not going to remove it and ask for a refund. If one doesn't encounter any install problems then it's a passable product. However, there are several other full featured programs available and I would suggest investigating those.",I replaced the free versions of Avast anti-virus and Malwarebytes ...,Platform: Download CodeEdition: 3 DevicesVerified Purchase,142 people found this helpful,147,14,Public,948328

I realized that after five years I probably could've done with the simple Antivirus version (cheaper too) instead of the Total Protection version but at least I didn't pay full price by going through Amazon.  For those with installation issues, I suggest you do the following:1. Create a McAfee account with an email and password BEFORE you install.  This way you are not going back and forth confusing yourself with multiple windows up.2.  Close everything else from your screen except Internet Explorer or Chrome that you are going to use to install the software.  Both browsers work for me for the installation.3. Click the installation once. If you've installed it before, chose the New Subscription and not the Renew Subscription (at least I do it this way to get a clean install).4.

Coverage for 3 devices just doesn't get more affordable or easier than this.Update 2020: I had 20 days left so I bought this again and it worked like a charm for the 3rd year in a row. Buy it, go to your digital purchase section, copy and paste the key. They even have a link that opens up the site where you enter the key. It took all of a couple minutes and added 365 days to my subscription. I also want to add that running this and a decent adblocker meant no problems at all in the last year so this actually works.Update 2021: With about 5 weeks left on my subscription I noticed the price dropped from $27.99 down to $19.99 for this and bought the digital download code again. It was instantly delivered to my email and appeared in my ""Games and Software Library"". In under a minute my subscription was extended for another year plus I didn't lose the days I had left on my current paid subscription from last year either.

The installation process STINKS as it leads you into a circular loop whereby you CANNOT use the download option for an ACTUAL download.  Why?  According to the tech I messaged they do NOT want you to run ANY other virus programs and he told me I MUST DELETE Avast.  Huh?  Where does it say that BEFORE you buy the program?  2.  There was NO error message during the above saga and NO help online to walk you through what to do.  3.  When it finally installed there were TWO icons created on my mac and both were GENERIC icons with NOTHING saying McAfee.  How bush league.  4.

I also got an installation error that said - ""You can't open the application ""McAfeeMacInstaller.app because it may be DAMAGED or incomplete"" - AGAIN - with NO instructions on what to do or how to fix it.  Oddly, it shortly finished the installation AFTER the error!  Jeez.  6.  THEN I got ANOTHER error ""System Extension BLOCKED"" and when I googled it McAfee's OWN WEBSITE said they KNEW of the problem and to NOT do what the instructions said which are to ENABLE McAfee under Security and Privacy of system preferences.  Are you kidding me guys?  This is UNACCEPTABLE!  7.  Then the ""Full Scan"" took FOREVER and was EXCEEDINGLY SLOW with NO % competed and a SOLID BLUE progress bar which means it's done when it was NOT done.  I STOPPED it after 12 hours or so as I was fed up waiting 8.  There is NO ESTIMATE for the duration of the scan and from what I read on the McAfee site this could take DAYS to run and in the end there are NO INSTRUCTIONS for how to FIX the ACTUAL problems.  Why run a scan for 2 days and then NOT FIX the malware?  9.  During the LogMeIn Session the tech CLOSED programs of mine WITHOUT ASKING!!!  How RUDE  **** Summary **** Do NOT buy this product.

I literally just took it out of the box and purchased this code at the same time. No way it could have a virus.

Every next one release seems to be getting worse than the previous one. And they care less and less about the users of their products.What is wrong within the product? :* It installs so many services that it practically hijacks my laptop.* It incorrectly reports intrusion attempts. How? Every TCP/IP connection has a standard way of termination by both sides which takes time according to applicable standards. Such termination involves packets going in both directions to indicate connection finalization. McAfee product uses smaller (substandard) timeout values and prevents proper closure of TCP/IP connections and then reports packets beyond those incorrect timeouts as intrusion attempts. Those are not real intrusion attempts, it is just incorrect McAfee implementation of networking standards.* 60 days before subscription expiration, the product starts showing popup messages which take 1/4 of the QHD (2560x1440) screen! They are shown 2+ times a day every day! They even show up while I am sharing my screen with customers.* Their customer support is in India and does not even understand the basic layout of the windows desktop. When I reported to them the issue with ad popups that ask me to buy their _McAfee_ products, they tell me it is a malware within the web browser. They are totally incompetent. I kept explaining to them that I don't use web browser and that popups are shown on the system tray of the desktop and ads are about their products. They don't understand and completely clueless. And the product does not have settings for almost anything, it is like it is not intended to be adjusted to user's needs.* The previous version of that product had a problem that you cannot uninstall it unless you allow within the firewall connectivity to google-analytics.com. I am thinking, why is it a security product will be sending my information to google-analytics? In other words that McAfee product doing some spying on me. They did not eliminate it, it just now the product forwards that info to their own servers. Windows allows to opt-out of such behavior, but McAfee doesn't.In conclusion, I'd say, some time ago McAfee security products did a good job. But over the past few years, the quality of protection and support is so low that it makes extremely difficult to trust McAfee with protection. It is in the bottom 20% of security products available on the market.

My HP laptop came with a free trial of McAfee Livesafe already installed, which I renewed and kept for the next year, even though I didn't need the type of protection it offers.  This Total Protection version was a great price, less than half of what I would have had to pay to get it directly from McAfee.  It was easy to install, too; took about two hours but I think that was because it had to uninstall the Livesafe first.
