After hours of fussing, he changed the Windows display resolution from 1920x1080 to the same as my old machine, 1366x768. I retried the activation and was then successful.  Once activated I changed my display resolution  back to default and now it works.  I hope this helps others as well.I'm a 15 year user of Turbo Tax and I love it.

This year I decided to try the download version. It didn't even occur to me to check the reviews.

I uninstalled/reinstalled several times, checked security/firewall and even changed the display resolution like a couple of reviewers suggested. Nothing worked, so I just paid $43 for 7 hours of aggravation, and worthless tax software. That is the last money that TurboTax will ever get from me!Another thing someone mentioned in the reviews- TurboTax has lobbyists whose goal is to keep our tax code as complicated as possible. I don't know if that's true, but it certainly makes sense that they'd want to do whatever they can to keep taxpayers in the dark and needing costly tax software every year. So...now I get to go purchase another tax software version, probably H&R Block. They probably have lobbyists too, but maybe their freaking software will actually work. And I'm getting the CD version, not the download.I REALLY WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS on this software download. I wouldn't have purchased it!

Upon completing the interview for my federal return, the software automatically moved on to ""analyzing"" the state return (Illinois) and asking a few follow-up questions (e.g., county of residence).  I was never given an option to go through each state-level income/deduction category but was instead funneled straight through to the page to finalize and submit my federal and state returns.  Fortunately, I recognized that I had not been prompted to enter information about contributions to a 529 plan (which are tax deductible in Illinois).  After significant effort, I managed to get into the full self-service interview for my state return (honestly, I couldn't even tell you how I got there) and enter that information.  I also realized at that point that the software had skipped the state property tax credit (even though all of my property tax info was entered in the federal interview) and a smaller credit for teacher expenses (even though this information was also included in the federal interview).  All told, Turbotax 2020 almost cost me nearly $1,000.  And now I have to go back and review previous years' returns completed with Turbotax, hoping that this is a one-time glitch.",Substantial missed deductions on state return,Platform: PC DownloadEdition: Deluxe + StateVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,31,19,Public,4519847

(1) Was stunned when it hit with me $60 in fees for my refund at the very end of the entire process. (2) The program repeatedly said it would get me the best refund but did not calculate the impact of going with the standard deduction vs my actual deductions. I went back to this software because I assumed the other cut rate I tax software did not calculate this for me because it was cheaper and TurboTax would - ahh that was a big fat no!  In the end I just dove in blind and just chose to change my deduction to actual without any help from the software. (3) Finally despite the gozillion commercials - when the program asked for things to be changed upon review - which I had not input - I couldn't find anyone to call and further reduced my refunds as a result just to get the software to finally just freakin file the taxes. All the commercials with those desks with the Turbotax helper standing ready to answer questions - I sure couldn't find them inside of my deluxe edition anywhere and online their site just said give us more $$. For those of you who have filed yet - print the forms and mail them in. TurboTax gouges you for $60 bucks for direct deposit. Won't make that mistake next year.  So using this software I paid over $100 just for the privilege to file with Turbo TAx. And no - it didn't ask me anywhere how much it cost me so I didn't get to deduct that $100 and I used the guided walk me through it approach.  Given all the errors which the program input into the worksheets - I have no idea how much more TurboTax cost me . . . not a great feeling when spending over $100.........,Hidden fees ($60) and dumb as a box a rocks,Platform: PC DownloadEdition: Deluxe + StateVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,229,21,Public,8133759

I'm blown away!It would be nice if the software were easy to use and accurate, but it's not and neither is HR Block (I did my taxes twice -- once on each package).

So, I won't be buying Block again and I will buy Turbotax.The issues with Turbotax:  When you have Roth withdrawals that are supposed to be tax exempt (you are over 59.5 and the Roth account is over 5 years old) it correctly, if the custodian has entered code T on box 7 of the 1099 R then the software imposes state tax on the withdrawal, which it should not do if you live in Massachusetts as I do.On schedule C it asks you for mortgage interest and real estate taxes as part of the home office interview and it also asks you for excess mortgage interest and excess real estate taxes (excess = amount not claimed on sch A as personal deduction).  If you follow the instructions, it then double counts tax and mortgage interest (once for each time you entered it).  To fix it, you have to enter zeros when it asks for these without the word ""excess"".  The instructions should say not to enter the same amount in both places.Also on schedule C  where the interview is asking about direct home office expenses (direct, meaning not for the whole house but rather just for the home office directly) it quite clearly  asks for taxes on the whole house.  If you enter taxes on the whole house there, it then double counts taxes (triple counts taxes counting the bug in the preceding paragraph).

Here’s the saga.My daughter and I have owned a condo for many years with a 75-25 split. I have filed the Schedule E using TurboTax Deluxe for the last 13+ years (including this and other properties).  We sold condo in 2020. Now the fun starts.I instructed TurboTax to apportion my income, expenses, and sales entries for 75% ownership.  It did that for income and expenses, but apportioned all of the sales cost and depreciation to me.  I called the TurboTax help, and they suggested that I override the sales info. I did this, and TurboTax computed the correct federal and state tax.  Progress.But--when I tried to file the taxes, TurboTax would not efile my Federal taxes with the overrides.  A long conversation with the TurboTax Helpdesk concluded that only a paper file would be possible.  Unsatisfactory--paper filing takes forever.I went back and instructed that TurboTax use my direct entries of 75% of income, cost, and sales information--I.e., I manually allocated the appropriate amount for my share of the property.  This worked and produced correct Federal Taxes.  However, it produced an incorrect recapture of depreciation for my state taxes.  Also, it introduced a spurious question on depreciation for another state that had nothing to do with my current tax!!  I redid the file and double-checked it several times, but the state tax was not incorrect. Where did depreciation recapture come from?So, in total frustration, I manually overrode the incorrect depreciation recapture numbers on the state return.  Happily, TurboTax efiled the federal tax. I always planned to file the state tax via paper.So this is a buggy version.  TurboTax correctly allocates rental property income and expenses, but then incorrectly allocates sales income and expenses on the same property.  When one uses the override feature of TurboTax, the program does the tax correctly, but will not allow the user to efile.  When the rental property income and expenses are manually entered, the federal tax on the sale is done correctly, but the state tax is incorrect.So, this is just a mess, and I have lost confidence in TurboTax.
