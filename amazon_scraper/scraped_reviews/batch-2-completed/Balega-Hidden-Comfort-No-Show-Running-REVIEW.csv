Here's a few comparative thoughts.I've bought five different types of Balega socks in total:Balega Soft Tread No Show (  Balega Soft Tread No Show - Royal BAL8926          )Balega Ultralight No Show (  Balega Ultralight No Show Socks - Royal Blue/White - Small          )Balega Hidden Contour (  Balega Hidden Contour Socks, Black/Yellow, Large          )Balega Hidden Comfort -- THIS PRODUCTBalega Blister Resist No Show (  Balega Blister Resist No Show Socks, White, Large          )The Balega Ultralight are very thin and rather smaller--especially in comparison to the other models. I've bought size Large in every sock, and they vary quite a bit. (For reference, I normally wear a men's 10, though I wear 11s for running.) If you like thin small socks, you may like the ultralight. Or go a size big if you want them to fit more comfortably.On the other hand, the Blister Resist were way too thick and large. They had so much excess material that they felt horrible and my feet moved around in them. They are very hot. The material on the top of the foot is actually very thin, but the bottom makes up for it. That said, They make a comfortable sock to walk around in on my wood floors in the winter. Since I won't run in them, I give them use around the house.The Hidden Contour and Hidden Comfort are similar. The Hidden Comfort are a tad thicker. They are both a bit thicker and larger than the Soft Tread socks, but they are comfortable and nicer for winter weather, when I tend to wear them running. If I were buying more, I'd go for the Hidden Comfort. Mine have stayed superbly comfortable longer than the Hidden Contour and still feel more padded.I like the Soft Tread best (for running) because they are thick enough to be padded and comfortable, but I have to pull them snug on my feet so there is no room for my feet to move against the sock. Also, they are not so thick that I feel my feet get hot -- and I run in 100 degree Texas summer weather. Finally, the Soft Tread are made R and L foot specific, which I've found to be helpful for fit. The Ultralights are as well, but not the other three models, if I recall correctly. Though the Hidden Comfort came with an L on each sock, that stands for ""Large"", not ""Left"". Also, the heel tabs on a lot of these sock models, including this one, are great and do a lot to make sure the sock stays in place.Hopefully this review helps a few folks decide what Balega sock might be best for them if they're looking to purchase.

My Amazon ones have already started to show holes in the forefoot.

For the gym and running, I have always just purchased whatever white ankle socks happened to be on sale at Target or Sears.

The are extremely comfortable, and since I have followed the washing instructions (no hot water, no bleach, no hot setting on dryer), they have not lost a bit of their fit, color, or comfort!  A few days ago, due to procrastination, I had to search around and find some of my old socks (most are in the garage to use as rags now).

Yes, they're that good.I have taken a photo of one inside-out so you can see the stitching for the extra padding for the toes and sole.

Of the three, the Balega would be the one I would not buy again. It is an acceptable running sock with a tab in the back that keeps it from riding down into the heel. You can buy six pair of TSLA running socks for less than one pair of Balega. I found the TSLA more supportive and reduced friction more than the Balega. If you need arch support then I would go with the Rockay even though it cost more. UPDATE: In less than two months and fewer than ten uses, the toe section shredded. I have worn the other running socks I bought the same amount of times and all of them show no sign of wear. I went for a six mile run and this was what I saw at the end.

A friend recommended this local shoe store geared towards runners and I came in an got fitted.  I never thought I would buy a pair of socks with my purchase but the employee that helped me recommended these Balegas. Back then I could only save up so much and I knew shoes were going to be pricey but didn’t account for a pair of socks that cost equal to a pack of regular socks I could get at Target.

I’ve used them for mud runs too and (as shown in the picture of the pair on the left) they still kept their form and quality!! The grey color looks darker in the picture but it’s actually lighter than it looks. I hand washed these thoroughly after every mud run event I ran and although the whiteness didn’t stay, it was still comfortable and lasted a long time. Only recently it started to wear down in my heal area and now has a small hole on each sock, which is why I thought I should finally buy another pair.I probably could have bought other pairs in the past, but before Amazon and online shopping was big, I could not find these socks  because I thought the brand was called “Bak Ga” lol. The logo on my old socks made it look that way so the last few years I’ve tried searching and came up short, until now that search engines are smarter and can pin point me in the right direction at least and then finally found the brand!!!I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend these socks if you do any physical activity, even if you walk everywhere. It’s so comfortable and obviously long lasting! I want to say my old socks are about 15 years old! I’m probably going to wear it around the house still on lazy days.

I've worn these for up to 12 mile runs so far and they prevent the bottoms of my feet from getting sore or burning slightly. They also keep my feet comfortable and dry.

I was drawn to the thick texture of the sock and the padded heel tab that helps prevent slipping. These socks are very comfortable! They feel good on my feet, and they allow my feet to breathe. The socks stretch well without feeling tight. The heel tabs really do help keep the socks in place, although they did slip down once. Overall, I'm pleased with this pair of socks. The price fluctuates a lot, so watch for a deal. At the time I bought my pair, it cost 3 times as much as my regular socks. I'm not sure they are 3 times better, but are at least twice as nice.

When I removed my running shoes I noticed the the stitching had come apart on the special seam that runs across the knuckle of the toes.  The threads just came apart.  I was extremely disappointed as the feel of the socks was so good, but the workmanship turned out flawed.  I am a little sad, because the socks came with a special sticker with a nice womans face indicating that the product had been specially checked for quality.  Unfortunately this pair of socks failed the quality test after just one use.  I did enjoy the feel and fit enough that I am planning to give another pair a try and see if it was just a coincidence as can some times happen.  I will change the rating if the next pair can hold up to the wear and tear of my daily runs.  Mind you I have been wearing some cheap running socks made by Russell sports for over a year, but can not find the same ones anymore.
