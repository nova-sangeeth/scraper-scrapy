After having trouble figuring out how Minecraft was going to work under the Nintendo Online system I went ahead and bought two versions and started fiddling with it. That's when I noticed how poor the system works with 2 big problems.1. The game in theory, will let people (each with their own Nintendo Online account) to play together without using Microsoft Realms. I thought this would be a godsend, but it seems Nintendo hasn't done a great job aligning the features and my son soon realized that you can create a new world and both of us can play on it, but when we log out he can no longer join that server. Doesn't matter if I make the server/world, or if he does, you seem to only get 1 play out of it. I looked at NAT types, I've tried port forwarding, and slew of other things. Nintendo/Mojang support is not helpful either with this problem apparently plaguing other users.2. The game itself is very buggy considering how it seems Nintendo Online handle latency and other issues. I found myself disconnected on a few occasions, or situations where I could no longer see my son's avatar even though he was right in front of me (I witnessed this over facetime). Other issues like landscape (FOV) not appearing seem pretty common in multiplayer.The singleplayer is fine and the controls once you get used to them work great, but the primary reason I got 2 copies of this was so I could play online and that feature is doesn't work. If the problem can be resolved I'll change my review.Update: 6+ months later and the Nintendo Online feature still does the same thing and I've had to continue paying for a microsoft realm for us to both play on.",Nintendo Switch Online Doesn't Work,Verified Purchase,210 people found this helpful,261,11,Public,3112125.0

I never owned it on the Wii U and I always did for the Mario packs but decided to wait as I have Minecraft everywhere else for my nephew. We play Cross Play from Switch to Xbox One and it's great. The Mario theme stuff does not work cross play which is understandable. It's really cool as well that I can play with him online with packs he bought on his xbox.

It is what it is.When it comes to other things, for example the offhand slot in game, it is EXTREMELY limited in comparison to the PC version where you can offhand virtually any item in the game. With this version, you can only effectively use in the offhand maps, and shields. Shields in particular you use by ""sneaking""/crouching.Besides those things, it is by all means Minecraft, and relatively up to date to boot as this is the ""Bedrock Edition"".One of the more impressive features is the ability to play fully locally with up to four players simultaneously EVEN IN TABLETOP mode!There is a local wireless play as well. So if your friends have their Switch's with them, you can play with them even without the Nintendo online service. So if possible, to play effectively with others, try playing locally on one Switch, or attempt to play via local wireless with multiple Switch systems.Yes Command Blocks are in this. So you can make those ""in game mods"" that are implemented solely by Command Blocks. That alone is a very powerful feature to be present.As for any additional tips for this particular version I can give is, try going into the settings, go to the control rebind section(s), and bind ""Jump"" to ""clicking"" the Left stick. Then bind ""Sneak"" to the Right stick click. Those two bindings in combination helps a lot I've found.Do note that as of 1/29/2020, there doesn't seem to be any way to disable ""double tap forward to dash"". So if you want to sprint, tap forward twice and you'll sprint. It would've been nice if it had a checkbox to disable that in case you wanted to bind sprinting to something else and not accidentally sprint from double tapping forward.All in all, if you goal isn't the online multiplayer, or you used the offhand feature and love it to death on PC, you're better off staying on PC/Windows-10-Version. If you can live with those compromises, or your party of friends like to play locally to begin with, its a great time! Its definitely a lot more manageable to make those large buildings by chipping away at your tasks a little bit at a time. Which is really easy to do due to the nature of the Switch.Do note that in order to play with others locally on one Switch system, you'll need to give your friends some sort of controller that has two joy sticks. You could hypothetically use a gamecube adapter in docked mode, and let your friends play with you via Gamecube controller. So no, you cannot play with one Joy Con per player in this game. But considering it uses twin stick controls, that is to be expected.","Some strange changes but overall, its Minecraft",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,283,34,Public,222048.0

I find that sometimes, it would either keep trying to sign or I have to re enter a code to link my Microsoft account with Minecraft.
