Mario is my jam so when I saw this game with a cool kitty cat power I was psyched. Played this for 30 minutes with my 3 kids and I'm pretty sure we all need therapy. The camera has a very small range and chases the person farthest ahead. The chasing is common with Mario, the small camera range makes it a nightmare. It also is 3D so there is foreground and background to explore, not a single linear course. This might work as a single player or maybe two player cooperative but not four. It also randomly switches your characters at the start or stages, huge huge tear fest with the little kid crowd. Not good.

While it had not been as strong as many gamers had expected, we still got a lot of great toys and games featuring Nintendo's proud mascot. We got the Super Mario 3D All-Stars package, which had Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Sunshine & Super Mario 64. But other Mario titles flowed to the Switch as well like Paper Mario: The Origami King. Still, when you look at games from the Wii U, you had almost all of the Mario games go to Switch already, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and New Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe. But one game that has not made it to Switch until now is Super Mario 3D World. The game was well-received for Wii U owners, but not as strongly sold, due to the lackluster sales of Wii U. Still, Nintendo pressed on and decided to release it for the Switch. Sadly, the game was suppose to be released last year, but got held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it is here, with a added bonus.Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, is a 2-in-1 purr-fectly conjured compilation where Super Mario 3D World is remastered and includes new features made for Switch, and the new mini-adventure Bowser's Fury which takes a unique twist on the Mario formula. First for Super Mario 3D World, the game looks great and brings in all the wonderfully made platforming from the Wii U game, with some small tweaks to make it work a bit better. In the game, Mario & his friends need to rescue Pixie Princesses that Bowser and his minions have captured. Along the way, Mario, Peach, Toad & Luigi each all maneuver with new and returning features  like the thrilling Cat Suit, which allows Mario & friends to maneuver in new and challenging ways. You can now climb up walls, attack like a feline and skid through pathways that are more challenging than ever. You also have courses that are new for Switch owners to hover through like Red-Hot Run, The Great Goal Pole, and the towering Champion's Road which will get you screaming for more.You also have a new game here: Bowser's Fury, where Mario must team-up with Bowser Jr. in a epic quest to save Bowser from a uncontrollable raging toxin where got into and becomes Fury Bowser (a towering Ganon-like creature) bent on mayhem to destroy Lake Lapcat. In this game, Mario must partner with Bowser Jr. on the quest to save Bowser from the raging being he has became. The game plays more like a Super Mario Odyssey adventure with Mario 3D World twists, packed-down into 1 major overworld. In the game, Mario and Bowser fight cat-themed foes like Boom Boom, Bullies and unlock puzzles and collect items and find the guarded cat shines to unlock bells that will help Mario & Bowser Jr. stop the unraveled Fury Bowser. The game itself is fun, but does feel interesting as a concept to make a condensed Super Mario 64-esque game. It works well, and the game looks amazing with the designs and platforming. In itself, the campaign may be short, but will take your fiery breath away when you play it. I think it looks charming and puts in a new wrinkle on the Mario 3D platforming formula that worked so well from past games like Super Mario Galaxy 2.There are a lot of things that work well with both of these games, with a few faults though. First of all, for Bowser's Fury, for skilled gamers of past Mario platformers, they may find the game shorter than other Mario titles, because of the main overworld. Some gamers would've wanted more overworld packed into the hub-world like earlier Mario titles, but it is actually interesting to put Mario into a Luigi's Mansion kind of setting. Also, you would also have to toggle with many different power-ups at once while battling Fury Bowser in the game that you may need that as a lifeline without losing lives. It may be shocking but sadly it is what it takes at times while controlling Mario & Bowser Jr. while mastering Bowser's Fury. While it may be repetitive, it still is a lot of fun playing. As for Super Mario 3D World, the main disadvantage is only if you have mastered the Mario adventure before from the Wii U era, you may not feel entertained with this game all over again. But nevertheless, considered that so many people never played the Wii U title, considered it was one of the weakest-selling game system from the Nintendo legacy, it still is worth playing at the end.When you look at Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, it is a mixed bag for some fans of the Super Mario Brothers legacy. But nevertheless, it is a absolutely fun title worth checking out. You get two adventures of the furry-kind into one package that does work. While many people may feel Super Mario 3D World is not a strong buy, it is a strong buy because it is 2 adventures into one nearly purr-fect pair of escapades. As for Bowser's Fury, I did get what I wanted out of it, and would still want to intrigued with more when I missed on it. Still for what it is worth, pairing the 2 games in one compilation is worth the money. If they were sold apart, it would not be worth purchasing. Still, I absolutely recommend buying this game pack a lot. It can come across as a great pair of actual purr-fect strangers.Graphics: A-Sound: B+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: Super Mario 3D World: A- for Solo: B+ for Multiplayer Bowser's Fury: B For Solo & MultiplayerOverall: B+",The Cat's Mario Meow 2-In-1,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: World + Bowser‚Äôs FuryVerified Purchase,56 people found this helpful,"10,424","5,686",Public,3721

Like many Wii U titles, this one was a gem overlooked due to the Wii U's low sales. Also like many Wii U exclusives, it means that so many missed out on it the first time. What makes Super Mario 3D World so special is that it's simply among the best Mario experiences you could have. It takes the best of Mario's 2D adventures and combined it with (then) the best of Mario's 3D adventures. It was the ultimate time capsule of everything that made Mario great, and so many people missed out on it. It is still a quint essential experience for Mario fans simply because of the time capsule it is, and remains even as Super Mario Odyssey has hit the scene.Mario games are never a plot driven affair. Normally they all involve Peach getting kidnapped and Mario going to save her. This one is different. In this one, however, Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach find a magic pipe that looks to be in disrepair. Mario and Luigi fix it... only for a Sprixie to emerge and explain to Mario and company that Bowser has come and imprisoned much of their population. She only speaks briefly before Bowser comes from the pipe, traps her in a jar and disappears. Fearing the worst, Mario and company hop into the pipe to go to this new world.The plot setup, if you couldn't tell, is largely ripped from the US version of Super Mario Bros. 2, only this time it isn't a dream. Also like Super Mario Bros. 2, you can choose between the four heroes: Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach. Each one has the abilities that made them worthwhile in that first outing way back in 1988. Mario is perfectly balanced, Luigi jumps the highest, Toad is the fastest and Peach can briefly hover in the air. There aren't a ton of reasons to use one character over another, however. Most of the stages are designed to be traversed in a similar manner.The game mixes the best of 2D and 3D Mario adventures. The game has a level by level design and a world map like 2D Mario games, but the over map acts as a hub similar to 3D Mario games. This means that instead of Mario following a pre-determined path you're actually free to explore the map without going on a track like in previous adventures. Sometimes you want to do this. The worldmaps sometimes contain Toad houses for items, 1UP Mushrooms, coins or even divergent paths to certain bonuses. Each time you complete a level you unlock new levels, sometimes multiple levels, and you don't have to complete every single stage to get to Bowser. There are even warp pipes (though not very many).Each stage centers around a concept. You're always introduced to this concept in a safe environment before it ramps it up. What makes this intersting for Super Mario 3D World is that it manages to make every level feel unique, experimental and fresh. Even if a concept gets repeated, there's an intersting twist on it that completely changes how you interact with it. You can get a small idea of what the concept is before jumping in. The stages themselves are usually fairly straight forward, but there are certain things to keep in mind as you go. The main goal of every level is to make it to the flag pole, but every level also contains green stars. Collecting these is important. As the game progresses you'll need them to unlock levels the further you get. Luckily there are green stars found in other places too such as mystery box stages, or doing the Captain Toad Treasure Tracker mini game. There are also stamps to collect in each stage, though this doesn't add much. It's just a collectible.Mario and company also have the ability to use various different suits and powerups. In most 3D Mario games, Mario's powerups are temporary, but here it takes a page primarily from Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World where the powerups are permanent until you get hit, and where you can store one to swap out at any time. There are familiar power ups. The majority of which you've seen before. The fire flower is a staple. The game also gives you the boomerang suit once again from Super Mario 3D Land, the Tanooki Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3 returns, and so does the Mega Mushroom from New Super Mario Bros. The big introduction here, however, is the cat suit. With it you can use a forward attack to hit any enemies in your way, do a front dive, and climb up walls. This is especially useful as you can also climb the flagpole at the end of a level for a free 1UP with the catsuit equipped. There are also temporary powerups that can't be taken out of a level, but are useful when you find them. There's an ice skate in some ice levels that you can ride around it, propeller boxes to hover, and also mobile cannons you can carry around.In addition, Mario has access to a lot of moves he normally only has in 3D games. Mario can long jump, backflip, side jump, and wall jump. This allows for more flexibility within the level design, and sometimes this encourages you to explore in the levels themselves.Super Mario 3D World doesn't provide a huge challenge. Instead the engagement is based on the game's rather intersting level designs and tight platforming. If there is one game which demonstrates the absurdity of a life count in this day and age it is most certainly the Mario series (which, thankfully, Odyssey did away with). Super Mario 3D is going to shower you with 1UPs. Even if you falter, it's not unusual to find enough coins, hidden 1UPs or reach the top of a flagpole. Even more than that, if you fail at a stage more than 5 times, the game offers you a Super Leaf that will make you invincible to enemies to get through it. This is purely optional, but the point is that Super Mario 3D World isn't really out to punish you for screw ups.What CAN make the game unusually challenging, however, is multiplayer. Much like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, 3D World supports up to 4 players simultaneously. This can make some courses easier, but more often than not multiplayer is a hazardous experience that will be prone to ending friendships. In the first place, the camera only really centers on player one. More importantly it's easier to do such things as pick up friends and throw them into pits, jump on them and screw them up, or just get in each others way. This doesn't multiplayer can't be fun, it just means that if you're goal is progress through a stage you may find that this is a much bigger challenge when some courses require everyone to be on the same page. You can also play multiplayer online, but this has had mixed results (at least for me) and is even worse simply because a precise platformer like Super Mario 3D World... was simply not made for lag, should you encounter it. Stick with local multiplayer here if you're looking to play with friends.There are a few noticeable differences from the Wii U version. The most eye-popping is that the game simply has a cleaner look and is playing at a much higher resolution. In fact, the game overall runs much faster. Characters move through levels faster, and everything flows much better. This is going to make you think that levels are short, but really it's just that progress through them is much quicker than you remember. You no longer have access to the Miiverse, which is no big loss. But the biggest addition here is ""Bowser's Fury,"" which is a new game in which you get to explore an island collecting Cat Shines. Every now and then Bowser will surface, you'll have to hide from him as he wrecks havoc, and then you'll resume. Once you've found enough in any given area you can become Giga Mario in cat form and battle Bowser. At first this seems fun, but the reality is that it gets old really fast. It looks beautiful, it flows seamlessly, but after a couple of hours of it, you're just going to go back to 3D World.If there were any downsides to Super Mario 3D World it would primarily be that some aspects of Mario games are not quite as charming as they once were. I mentioned the life system feels obsolete in a game that is so quick to dole out so many lives. The timer also doesn't feel necessary anymore. The only time you'll feel like time is of the essence is if you get stuck trying to find one last green star, only to have to start a level over again because of time. But the timer simply isn't that big a deal, or that constricting. It just doesn't really have a reason to be here other than because 2D Mario games once used it. Neither of these things is really detracting from the game, but it's hard not to notice them.All of that said, it's hard not to admire the creativity put into the game's levels and design. Super Mario 3D World remains one of Mario's best outings. It takes the best of 2D Mario games and combines them with the best of the 3D games. It allows for Super Mario 3D World to represent the best of what the Mario series has offered us over time. Given that Mario's next major outing to follow 3D World originally was Super Mario Odyssey, it felt like a love letter back in the days of the Wii U before Mario would evolve once again. Today, it serves as a reminder of where Mario has been as we remember the legacy he has created. It is a worthwhile game to play and delightful for Mario fans. Especially those who enjoyed the games that Super Mario 3D World opts to pay tribute to.",Mario's Delightful Time Capsule,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: World + Bowser‚Äôs FuryVerified Purchase,14 people found this helpful,"18,962",774,Public,278905

The main plot is about bowser kidnapping the sprixie fairies, and in this game you can play as peach now that she isn‚Äôt kidnapped. (You can also play as rosalina after beating world star-2, peach and rosalina are perfect for little sisters, Princess lovers, etc) You can play as Mario, Luigi, Toad, Peach, and Rosalina. All have their ups and downs.Mario- most balanced of them all, not much to sayLuigi- jumps higher but slides a littleToad- runs fast, but is small and can‚Äôt jump very highPeach- can float, but doesn‚Äôt run that fastRosalina- honestly the most op character, can‚Äôt think of a bad thing about her but she‚Äôs like Mario but with the spin move from super Mario galaxy.The multiplayer gets criticized for being, ‚Äútoo chaotic‚Äù, but in my opinion, it‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve had for a while.The game has 11 worlds In total.World 1- the easiest world, very grass themed and made to introduce new players, not the best to replayWorld 2- desert themed, a little bit harder than world 1World 3- Ice themed, has lots of fun, creative levels (such as the super Mario kart snes themed level)World 4- Also desert, very challengingWorld 5- also ice, world 5 has some fun levels such as the golden expressWorld 6- cloud themed, the best world in the game in my opinion, lots of creative levelsWorld Castle (7)- lava themed, {spoiler alert} not the final world in the game, but a very fun one and very replayableWorld Bowser (8)- carnival themed, this world is bad*ss. The big bowser animatronic, the music, and that‚Äôs just the hub world. This is home to some very challenging levels too.World star- space themed, very fun levels and awesome new unlockable character.World mushroom- harder remixes of other levels, very fun and hardWorld flower- like world mushroom, but with different levels and more harderWorld crown- the hardest levels in the game, such as champions roadAnd that‚Äôs just the worlds. There are also the power ups.Mushroom- gives you a boost in life, turns small Mario into big MarioFire flower- throws fireballsStar- invincible for about 5 secondsSuper bell- turns you into cat Mario, you can pounce and scratch and climb and dive.Tanooki leaf- turns you into tanooki Mario, you can float and stuffBoomerang- you can shoot boomerangsThere are more, but those are the main ones.Super Mario 3D world is fun. But we haven‚Äôt talked about bowsers fury, the new content.In bowsers fury you go around lake lapcat collecting cat shines. Collect enough to get the giga bell to fight fury bowser. Bowser jr also helps you because he wants his dad back to normal. The lake lapcat is full of cat trees, enemies, and even pigeons. Every thing is cat themed.This game is fairly short and I 100%ed it In a month (I could have 100%ed it faster, but I was also playing 3D world)Overall this whole game is worth $60.But only if you don‚Äôt have 3D world. This game is not worth the $60 price if you also have 3D world. Bowsers fury is NOT worth $60. If They released it separately, it would be about $20. This game is mainly for players you haven‚Äôt experienced the original 3D world yet. 3D world is the game I usually play, bowsers fury is a fun side, but again, it‚Äôs not worth a whole $60.Other than that, awesome game. 9.5/10 and a big 5 star rating.",A late review of a great remastered game,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: World + Bowser‚Äôs FuryVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,98,87,Public,913563

If you've played Super Mario 3D Land, it's a super-sized sequel to that game.BUT be warned that the camera and the isometric perspective sometimes make 3D World more challenging (and frustrating) than it really needs to be.  At first, the combination of the two and the unusual dash mechanic (at least unusual for Mario titles) will cause some real frustration, but if you stick with it for a bit (and consider playing in portable mode, which, for some reason, makes these elements easier to manage‚ÄîI suspect because 3D Land, on which this is based, was made for the 3DS), you'll minimize their impact.Bowser's Fury, a sort of a cross between Super Mario Odyssey and 3D World, has Mario exploring a large map containing multiple smaller challenge areas, each of which includes several objectives, with occasional interruptions from a giant raging Bowser.

You can't even be miffed by failing a challenge as the game provides you the tools (within reason) to succeed in a variety of ways and grooms you into being a master with careful course construction and consideration for exploration and character movement. It fits comfortable with a multitude of playstyles and though I have not beat the main game yet I would easily recommend it at the current price. It's well worth your time especially if you're a fan of the original World, Odyssey, Galaxy. or 3D Land on the 3Ds. This takes those same mechanics found on the 3Ds, tweaks them, adds the necessary flair and it's all flourish. Fantastic game and brilliantly beautiful.

It is very short, and has its frustrating aspects (in particular after you beat the main story bowser's fury becomes harder to calm down, and this harder for the player to focus on the levels). It uses the core gameplay of Mario 3D world in a more open-world environment which makes it effectively a true-to-form 3D Mario game similar to the likes of 64 and Odyssey, albeit a lot shorter. It is worth noting that the 2-player aspects of this are similar to Odyssey in that the second player is more like a companion/helper than anything else.Definitely a must-have on the switch for any Mario/platformer lover!",A Great Collection of 2 3D Mario Games,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: World + Bowser‚Äôs FuryVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,4,7,Public,7755782

This is two games in one - a Switch port of the WiiU title, ""Super Mario 3D World,"" and, ""Bowser's Fury,"" a new title.Super Mario 3D World is 3D Mario by way of Super Mario World - levels are linear stages. Unlike Mario 64 or Sunshine, with their open ended areas, and Galaxy, in which each level has several different variations on each revisit, 3D World sticks to individual linear courses. The player has less freedom, but the levels are more polished and varied. This is a different kind of game than other 3D Mario titles, but that isn't a bad thing. I especially recommend this title to any older gamers who miss the feel of the early 2D Mario titles - there is a lot of DNA from those classics baked in.Bowser's Fury, meanwhile, is closer to a modern 3D Mario game, perhaps most closely resembling Mario 64, but housing its levels inside a seamless open world. The game is arguably worth the price of admission on its own, in spite of its brevity,  and represents a massive step forward for 3D Mario titles. I'm reminded a bit of Jak and Daxter's overworld, but without its strict limitations as to what is and isn't, ""part of the game."" If you see a surface, you can jump on, dive off, or climb on it (with the appropriate power up) - allowing a lot of flexibility as to how you approach each challenge.","If you own a Switch, buy it.
