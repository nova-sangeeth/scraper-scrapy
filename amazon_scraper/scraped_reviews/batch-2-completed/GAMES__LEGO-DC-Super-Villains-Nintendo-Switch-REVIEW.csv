One of the best things about them though is they are so approachable for all gamers and this game is no exception.  I would actually say that so far this Lego game along with Lego Incredibles is my families favorite Lego game to date.  The kids are enjoying it because as usual it looks great and the voice cast is absolutely INCREDIBLE which overall helps a lot.  They also enjoyed making a custom villain which is a nice touch and the character you create can be customized throughout the game as you unlock more abilities. The roster much like the Lego marvel superheroes 2 is massive and while it's fun to play as a villain in this game thanks to the plot which I don't want to spoil too much. You are really more of an anti hero trying to stop other villians while getting some help.  The game is a lot of fun and with the myriad of great adult focused titles being released currently this is a great family game and game for kids!The switch version looks good in handheld and console mode.

This may be one of the poorest designs I've seen.1. Camera angles prevent usable view to carry out character required activity to proceed.  Activity resides on a wall panel inside of an elevator on the side that isn't in view of the player.2. Characters get trapped due to bugs, after many minutes, the game may reset the character otherwise you need to quit the level and lose all progress or exit the game and lose progress.  One example, clayface is allowed to jump over a railing and hover in air over a room below.  As the character has exceeded the intented play space, the character is now locked outside of the area.  If the character jumps on top of an item intended to be broken, the character can exit the ""playable"" area.  Character can be moved around inside the bug yet not exit the bug space.3. sub-characters required to complete a certain task become trapped.  Riddler must free prisoners from the police station and they form a human ladder to reach the second floor of the station for the story to proceed except for one sub character got trapped in a loop trying to break open the vault in the adjacent room and cannot be reset or allowed to proceed so you have to exit the level and lose any progress to the last saved area.4.  Cannot save.  You either finish the level or start from the last checkpoint if you weren't forced to exit the level due to the aforementioned bugs.",Rent before you buy.

It's not that they are bad, there are just so many of them and they tend to be incredibly similar. Jurassic Park, Marvel, Incredibles, etc. They are all focused around big budget heroes that save the day or follow the plot of a movie. Again, not bad, just stale. Well, in comes LEGO DC Super-Villains to spice things up.LEGO DC Super-Villains begins like any other LEGO game, except from the villains point of view. You're not trying to save the day, you're actually trying to break out of prison. Plus, you are given the chance to create your very own super villain. You can create it however you like with whatever powers you like along with the costume and visual design of the outfit. This was a huge hit in my house as my son made multiple costumes depending on his mood. We had a Red Ninja super villain, an ice super villain that for some reason wasn't wearing pants, and numerous others. This was the main draw of the game for my son and he absolutely had a blast having his character interact with others in the world and actually be a major part of the story.The gameplay itself is what you're used to. Break things and then rebuild to get past puzzles, but it's fun this time around doing it for all the wrong reasons. You're a super villain after all and it's neat to be the bad guy for once.If you're playing on the Xbox or PS4, you know the graphics will look amazing and they absolutely do in this game. The bricks all look and react like you would expect a living breathing LEGO would to act when interacted with.If you have kids in the house that love playing LEGOs or if you're an adult that loves LEGOs (I know I am one...) then this is a no-brainer purchase. It's a solid game with some awesome new mechanics and the ability to create your own villain is a huge hit.

If you played a Lego game before you know what to expect, but with a different story.Story. Plot starts off with a breakout of super villains. Evil doppelganger of the Justice League from Earth-3 comes in and captures the Justice League. Now it's up to the super villians to save the world.Story/plot may be generic, but the the character interactions are very good. Fun word play and banter between characters, not to mention the non-verbal background activity going on. A lot of fan service and references to be had. Voice acting is also very good across the board.There is a create your own villain. He/she has super power upgrades they gain throughout the story, but they are mostly there for plot progression, and most of the time you don't really play him/her. Think of the silent protagonist from the South Park games; mostly there for plot device.Gameplay, as mentioned before typical of your lego games. Defeat enemies, solve puzzles and collect lego studs for unlocks, in-game purchases. No game over screen rather you do lose lego studs that you collected when you lose all your hearts or fall into a pit. There are multipliers so best not to get hit when doing combos.Puzzles are character ability specific. Some areas in the level are locked first playthrough since some characters abilities can't be used until later since they're not unlocked during the time of the story.There is a hint system that you can toggle on/off in the menus. Will tell you exactly what to do, if within the vicinity of solving the puzzle, so child friendly.There is a photo mode where you can take selfies at anytime during gamplayBoss battles are super easy. Most come down to: wait for them to do their special attack, they will get dizzy, then do a free hit on them. Rinse and repeat until they're defeatedThere is an open world city to explore with side missions between story chapters, but i tend to skip them until the end since there's no leveling system to be had and most areas within levels are unlocked via characters you get later on.There is vehicle gameplay, but the driving is horrible and stiff.

I played for dozens of hours but ultimately decided I am not the kind of person to complete 100% of the content and felt satisfied stopping before that.It’s definitely a worthwhile experience to put extra time into this game beyond the main story campaign, which is really only about 25% of the content available. Although I’m not entirely compelled to go all the way to 100% completion on this one, I won’t hesitate picking it up again in between games in the future for some casual side questing to chip away at more content.For anyone who might be considering picking this game up, it’s well worth the relatively small price tag. You definitely get your money’s worth. There is plenty to do, the gameplay is fun, the visuals are beautiful, the main story is good.  It might take a bit to get into if it’s your first LEGO game, some of the controls and functions only make sense in the LEGO game universe, but if you stick with it you will most likely find yourself completely hooked in after a bit.",You Could Play This Game Forever,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: Standard,,289,88,Public,159201.0

It included all of the DLC! I like Batman and all so I decided to buy this. With this being so kiddy friendly, playing this was like poking small wooden sticks into my ear drums. It was that painful for me, and it made me want to vomit! The joker is not a circus clown, but this game makes him out to be. He is thoroughly rinsed and sanitized for children with small minds and expectations. This is not an adult game, especially worth $75 at launch. The opening music made me want to hurl chunks at my 85"" flat screen. From this game, I've decided that all lego games are stupid. The jokes in this game are so preschool that I'd probably enjoy watching Barney the Dinosaur and think that was way funnier than the jokes from  this piece of excrement! I thought that maybe this is one crappy game in the entire lego game universe, but I've discovered that this is not so. Every lego game is like this. And then, these crappy games serve up adult in jokes, that are insulting to the average adult intellect. But for stupid adults, this lego crap expands their stupiness! If I were being tortured by the enemy, and they made me play this game, I would protest and ask for a lesser punishment such as being thouroghly flogged and given a starvation diet!",Paid 75 bucks for this!,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: Standard,,125,38,Public,426797.0

The graphics going between Gotham to Metropolis, (Rain to sun) was fantastic.  The story lines were fun and enjoyable.  One thing I never had liked in any Lego game is the race challenges.
