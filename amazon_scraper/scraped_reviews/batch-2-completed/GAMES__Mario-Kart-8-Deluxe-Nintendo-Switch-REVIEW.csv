This is a deluxe version of Mario Kart 8 that was released for the Wii U. This game has all the great things that make Mario Kart fun. The tracks are great and varied with some popular tracks from older Mario Kart games. Controlling the game works great too. You can use the Joy-Cons, split the Joy-Cons for 2 player, and use the pro controller. They all work great and controlling the kart is responsive and tight. They also include a Smart controller mode which basically helps steer and accelerate, great for younger kids. They will feel they are actually racing and not have to worry about falling off the track. There a lot of content in this game: tracks, racers, different kart mods, and the online play is fun too.

For those who already own the Wii U version, the changes may or not be worth it depending on what you're looking for. Without further ado here are the list of changes compared to the Wii U version:1. 1080p with higher frame rate* when docked (TV mode) instead of 720p (on Wii U). Tabletop  mode it's still 720p. Frame rate TV mode is 60fps, off TV mode is 59fps. Yes, one frame makes a difference when comparing side-by-side and/or when you have been playing dozens of hours of the original2. 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, & Inklings (Boy and Girl)3. Characters can now carry up to two items at once, even if they don't drag the first item4. Double Item Box. Get two items when you run through a double item box or two singles. Note that you cannot swap items back and forth5. ""Smart Steering"" A mode that prevents you from running off course or into a puddle of water. Good for toddlers or young children getting into the game (especially on the rainbow road courses). If the Smart Steering mode is on, the player's vehicle will have an antenna sticking out its rear end. The antenna blinks when Smart Steering is active.6. ""Auto-accelerate"" for beginners. Can be used in conjunction with Smart Steering, essentially you don't have to hold down the accelerate button. Again, good for young children who just want to drive through the track without any stop-gaps. Works well when using the wheel peripheral7. All DLC (from Wii U) included. Everything is unlocked from beginning except kart parts and Gold Mario. Kart Parts are unlocked by playing through the game and collecting coins. Gold Mario unlocked by winning all of the 200cc grand prix cup8. Time Trials in the 200cc engine class have been added. Also added  are new ghosts of Nintendo employees to race against9. Ultra Mini-Turbo, denoted by pink/purple sparks that appear after the orange sparks which makes you boost significantly faster. Cannot be used with smart steering on10. Online Play.-Option to change character and vehicle combinations during an online lobby without having to leave/exit out; this is done by pressing the ""Y"" button during the course selection screen of an online lobby.- You can see what lap everyone is in, in spectator mode if you finish early-When you win a match you get to wear a crown in the main online menu screen for everyone in the lobby to see. Hat also present when you're in the lead during a match- More icon packs for tournament mode11. Faster loading times. Just a few seconds, but it adds up overtime. If you purchase Mario Kart Deluxe digital over the physical you get 1-2 secs off each track loading screen12. New amiibo compatibility. You now get racing suits when scanning in specific amiibo13. Boo and feather (battle mode only) item return to the game14. You get the same 48 courses racing courses. But you get 5 additional new battle stages in battle mode + 3 retro stages15. The Villager in now split between male and female selectable characters with different stats bringing the roster to the total of 42 characters (excluding character variants. Example: different color yoshis/shy guys, create your own mii, etc)16. Graphical change: Motion Blur, High Quality Shadows, Confetti now drop to the ground showing animation at start of match17. Battle mode: Biggest change in terms of gameplay. There are 4 battle mode game types:-Balloon Battle. Traditional Arena Style (no more battling in a circle) Mario Kart Battle mode where you use items to pop your opponent's balloons or steal them via feather item in order to score points.-Renegade Round Up. Cops and Robbers style setup. One team with the potted piranha plants try to capture all the other team before time runs out. Once captured your teammate can also free you from your jail cell-Bob-omb Blast. Same as balloon battle, but you only carry bombs-Coin Runner. Collect as many coins in the stage as you can before time runs out-Shine Thief. A keepway style game where you have to hold the Shrine Sprite the longest before time runs out. The driver holding the shrine sprite will have their speed lower the longer they hold it==Additional notes: - There's 4 player split screen in docked (TV mode) and handheld/table top mode. Note that the screen for table top mode is really small and may be a problem for those who are far-sighted. When playing 2 player it's 60fps, 3 or more on the same screen it'll drops down 30fps-There's no Download Play, so you have to play split screen or have another copy of the game if you don't want to share the same screen or play more than 4 players-Stamps do not make a return since the Switch doesn't have miiverse-No more gamepad/duel screen when playing TV mode, so this time around you cannot see what items everyone is holding by glancing down-No voice chat (as of this review) unfortunately. Was present in the Wii U version with mic hardware (which no one bought). There's supposed to be a smart phone app that takes advantage of voice chat, but no word yet from Nintendo-Statistics of the vehicle parts and drivers have also been changed to make game more balanced-Other balance changes:Fire Hopping have been removed: An exploit in the Wii U version where you can repeatedly hop from left to right to get extra speed from turboboost.Blue shell dodge exploit still present. It's when you fall off the cliff the last second the blue shell is about to hit you, it'll save a lot of time recovering from the hit. Note this cannot be done when smart steering mode is on If a Blooper is about to ink the player as they cross the finish line, the player will still get inked. Red Shell Nerfed: If you're holding an item behind you while in the air, you can block a red shellEasier to break while drifting (advanced tactic)-Luigi still has his signature death stareIf there's anything I missed please put it in the comments.Overall, i personally think the best additions are the enhanced battle mode and the portability aspect as I can now play during my break period and commute to work. I already sunk in over 300+ hours on the Wii U version and the upgrade is totally worth it for me as I got more than my money's worth in the original game on Wii U and plan to sync 300+ on the Switch version especially with the ease of use due to it's portability, and 100+ more hours of play in battle mode play with housemates. Well that is my personal perspective, so if you are in a similar situation it's a very good buy. If not, I hope the list of changes helped you in your purchasing decision",List of Changes (Compared to the Wii U version),Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,"1,477 people found this helpful","37,910","2,543",Public,75

I never unlocked much on the Wii U and didn't buy any DLC, and for various reasons, I didn't even enjoy playing MK8 on the Wii U. So even tho I purchased the same game twice, I have no regrets. I've only played single player mode, which is pretty boring (I always get 1st place). Online play is where it's at, even tho I am consistently in 12th place and losing points, it's still fun. I understand that Nintendo plans to make their online gaming a subscription based model before the end of 2017, so we'll see if I'm singing the same tune then.Tried it with various controllers: a bare naked Joy-Con, a Joy-Con in one of those steering wheels, the Joy-Con comfort grip, and the Pro controller. As expected, the Pro controller is the most comfortable and best way to play.

There are four different rainbow roads and I couldn't fall off of them when I TRIED to. The camera and course automatically moves you around obstacles so you could probably just hold down the A button and you'd still beat half the NPCs.On the other hand, if you want a game that your five year old and fifteen year old can play together, this is ideal. It levels the playing field across age ranges because you can't use strategy with your item throwing to screw over other players.Overall, if you are an older player or enjoyed the challenge in Gamecube-era games, you will be bored with this game after two or so playthroughs of each level.",Made EXCLUSIVELY for children,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,4,6,Public,9670246

I don't think your the person I need to sell on this.If you have never played Mario Kart, and you have a Nintendo Switch...I mean, what are you waiting for??? Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is not just another racing game - you race underwater, through the skies, upside down, through a toybox; there is so much to see and do and learn here. Plus, there is a learning curve, and the game is designed to help you become a better racer gradually, while still letting you take home the Gold cup. Single player is great, and playing this on the go with the Switch is ideal because each race is never longer than 5 minutes total. You could easily power it up in the doctor's waiting room and probably finish a few Cups before being called back.And the multiplayer is great! There are other features designed to help even the odds between veterans and new-comers. From the Grand Prix to the Battles, it's anyone's game to win! The online is much more challenging, but after completing all the 150cc cups with Gold, you should be set to take anyone on.If you have a Nintendo Switch and don't have Mario Kart 8, you should question why you bought it in the first place.",Fast Fun for All Ages,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,110,35,Public,1919386

Other than that, I agree with some of the other reviews that this game could use some major improvements.  They have relegated the extra power ups so that you only get them if you are in certain positions.  So if you are in first you never get shells or invincibility stars or anything like that.  So, holding onto the first position puts you at a disadvantage?  I would think everyone behind you gunning for your spot was enough of a disadvantage.  Really, this does not affect the person in front as much as much as you would expect though because those behind him are now in a firing range where everyone has weapons and are busy slowing each other down.  So, if you manage to get out front with a bit of headway  its usually pretty easy to win otherwise if your stuck with the masses it can get pretty difficult.  I would prefer a fully random draw of power ups.  For the more battle royal missions they have added cheap gimmick spots into the maps such as one where there is a ramp onto the walls that players can just stop on top of and take a rest and others cant acually reach those players without going out of their ways to aim just for them.","Great game, would say not an improvement against other Mario karts.",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,61 people found this helpful,533,148,Public,71931

The roster is comprised of some familiar faces but I wish there was more variety. It feels as if the koopa characters and other costume/baby variants of characters are fillers. It would have been nice to see characters from other franchises similar to super smash bros. That brings me into the second point which is the absence of unlockables. From the start all the characters and courses are available to you. The only items you are able to unlock are parts to customize your ride but I wish other forms of rewards were introduced such as more characters, courses, and an achievement list.Despite the two drawbacks of the game this is the definitive edition and it does not take away from the overall experience of having a great time playing with other people.

Three years later, and we now have Mario Kart Deluxe, a way for Nintendo to capitalize on their huge Mario Kart fan-base without dedicating too much time and money into producing the 9th iteration of the franchise this early into the Nintendo Switch's lifespan. For the most part, Deluxe is identical to the original MK8, with a couple new features included to give players a reason to pay full price again for what is essentially the same game. These include additional Battle Modes, some new tracks, characters and vehicles, all the DLC from the original Wii U version, and some refinements to online multiplayer (such as being able to change vehicles and characters without leaving the online multiplayer lobby). Of course, the main draw to getting Deluxe is being able to play Mario Kart 8 on a handheld device, which for all intents and purposes has now eliminated the reason for players to still be using Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS. However, the real question is if all these minor enhancements are enough to make MK8 players spend full price again on what is essentially the same game. The answer to that is two-fold. For people who still own a Wii U system and the original Mario Kart 8, I would not recommend getting Deluxe. However, if you're planning on selling your Wii U and upgrading to the Nintendo Switch, or you never bought a Wii U in the first place, then yes, I would recommend getting Deluxe, as it will probably be several more years before we see a true Mario Kart 9 sequel.","Great Game, But Still Has Online Connection Issues",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,88,20,Public,3696871

Fell in love with the original Wii version and this one is much better. Some of the maps you'll recognize but many have new twists and there are new maps to race. I love the battle games as well. (Balloon Battle is my personal favorite) Switching to two or more player mode is easy. (When you first try two player, for some reason the settings will be all turned on such as the safer driving mode, so drifts don't work as well, and the players kart will always be hitting the gas, and in battle mode that's not convenient so make sure you turn those settings off). And online playing is a welcome addition. You can choose between regional and world. There isn't a 'Grand Prix' in the online racing, just one race at a time. And playing Battle online, there's just one round at a time, no 4 rounds and then a winner is decided. Also there's no picking which battle game you want to play, it just cycles through the five. At first I didn't like it but it forced me to get better at games I didn't really play often. In the online playing there is a personal point system. You start out with 1,000 points and depending how you rank each round, you can either earn or lose points. (Got down to 988 and back up to 1250). While the console comes with two controllers, I find myself considering buying another set because I don't like the feel of playing with one controller, as it's so small. Also I keep tilt controls off cause I find it makes me lose control.

Perhaps even better than on Wii U due to the higher resolution supported by the new hardware.Now, and this is probably the thing I like the most about it, is that we finally have a console-quality Mario Kart game to play on the go. While all the portable Mario Kart games have been good enough, the console versions have always been superior by far. The fact that we can fit the entire Mario Kart 8 experience in our pockets now is a reality feels surreal.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe features all the tracks, characters, DLC and features from the orginal straight from the box. No unlocking... well actually scratch that, you do have to unlock the kart parts again. But all tracks and characters are ready to go from the start.If you never played MK8, you can expect a great arcade racing game with all the crazy combat action you can expect from the series. There's a few things you need to know.- Coins are back. Collect coins across the tracks to increase your max speed.- New items such as the Boomerang and the Pirahna Plant.- Antigrav mechanics, now you can ride your kart even on walls and upside down at certain sections.- As in Mario Kart 7, vehicles can be customized. You can glide through the air and drive underwater as well.- Mario Kart 8 for the first time in the series features cameo characters and tracks from other Nintendo games such as Zelda, Animal Crossing, Fzero, Excitebike and Splatoon.- Go all the way from 50cc up to 200cc for the first time. Yes, it is crazy fast and makes the game a lot harder than you'd expect.The Deluxe version brings a revamped Battle Mode that is actually fun to play, with the classic modes Coin Runners, Shine thieft, Balloon Battle, Bob Omb Blast and more. This definitely makes the experience feel more complete. It also brings back the ability to hold 2 items at the same time which hasn't been done since Gamecube's Mario Kart Double Dash.I don't know if the existance of this port means that Switch won't get its' own proper MK9. Hopefully it still does. Right now this is too much deja vu for my liking.

What makes this version better isn't so much the new true Battle Mode or the new characters but how the game plays on the Switch platform itself.A friend of mine with a Switch console and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe took our systems to a company retreat held at an outdoor facility where a huge rainstorm left the field wet and muddy. We decided to use some free time to play some Mario Kart with our systems with wireless local multiplayer. Soon people began looking on as we played. We both detached the JoyCons on each of our consoles, which allowed one additional player per console to join in with the Switch units propped on a table top. Eventually this grew into a crowd and we opted to then use a docked Switch console to connect to a projector where we easily synced our pairs of JoyCons to allow four player multiplayer on this single console. This is where Nintendo's Switch console and games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe shine. The flexibility of the console and simple fun of Mario Kart made for a very entertaining afternoon that was enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike.",Just like the great Mario Kart 8 but with Battle Mode and new characters,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,109,47,Public,2203734

Also am quite surprised that the joycons are comfortable for playing Mario Kart. The right joycon takes a little time getting used to, with the joystick in the middle, but it's fine.
