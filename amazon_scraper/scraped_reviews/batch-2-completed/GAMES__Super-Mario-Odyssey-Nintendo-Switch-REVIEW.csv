Odyssey is spectacular. I've been playing Mario games since the very beginning, so I like to think I know a thing or two about them. Super Mario Odyssey may well be the best 3D Mario game ever made, and it's in my personal top 3 Mario games of all time.As you might've seen advertised, the big new feature is Mario's sentient hat companion Cappy, who lets him possess many of the denizens of the various kingdoms you visit in this adventure. While the highlight of many Super Mario games throughout the years has always been the various suits and power-ups players can get their hands on, being able to outright become many of the creatures you come across is a twist on that formula that lets players do all kinds of new and sometimes unexpected things.While the game is - as expected - family friendly, it provides layers of challenges for players of all ages. Some of the (optional) tasks in the game are outright hair-tearing, for only the most skilled players, but that's part of what achievement is all about! However, while the game is designed to appeal to everyone, Nintendo took the time to add some extra nods to long-time fans, not only in the worlds and the critters/characters you happen across, but through setpieces and a spectacular mid-game musical number that old-timers like me have to appreciate.If you have a Switch, get this game. If you don't have a Switch, get one, and then get this game. Whether you're a new Mario fan or an old one, this is the definitive 3D Super Mario experience.",Nintendo hits a real homer with this Odyssey,Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: PhysicalVerified Purchase,272 people found this helpful,295,21,Public,1983973.0

Such a creative game with such accessible puzzles for all ages, even adults. The music is so wonderful and the environments are spectacular. The controls couldn't be simpler and you know, playing with another person gives you more moves to do with Mario and Cappy. I cannot remember the last time I played a game where playing co-op gave you an advantage other than replacing a buggy AI with a human player. It makes so much sense! There's a true motivation to play with someone else - and not ONLINE.I must say the graphics in Odyssey are gorgeous, far beyond anything out of PS4 or Xbox One. Seriously. It's colorful, vibrant, and deep. Rich hues supplant dullness, even when in areas portrayed to be mysterious or cold. It's just short of inducing synesthesia.I'm so glad Nintendo is finally back! This is the way gaming is supposed to be - light, endlessly fun and inspiring! Too many games on the ""Big Bad Consoles"" are so dark or filled with such negativity - it brings you down without realizing it.

Actually, it makes me and my sister just excited about everything, even when we aren't playing the game. We're happier individuals for playing Odyssey, no joke.Nintendo, you've nailed it with the Switch and brought back the joys of gaming to a faithful 90's kid while giving the up and coming younger generation the discovery of something that has been missing from gaming for over 20 years - true, genuine inspiration.","True, Genuine Inspiration",Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: PhysicalVerified Purchase,127 people found this helpful,988,77,Public,35365.0

Very few games make me want to sit and play for hours on end. Even with Breath of the Wild, I haven't beaten it and can't get myself to play for extended periods of time.But this game is glorious.I'll leave this review spoiler free for the sake of those looking into purchasing this awesome title.It took me about 4 days to beat the main story. This included getting 8 hours of sleep and a work/school schedule. But that was using all of my free time playing this fantastic game. And even after that, there is still a LOT to do after the main story, so I've been playing it still.This is a console quality mario game. In my opinion it's the best 3d open-world mario title to date. Mario 64 will always have that nostaliga spot for me, but this is the new winner in my eyes. Not only because of the gameplay, but with the nature of the switch it's also a portable title. I played this while waiting at campus for a class to start. Almost was late to class because I lost track of time.And the mechanics are great. Even after beating the main story, I find myself learning new advanced moves that make previously tall walls easy to get over.The music is also good. Not all of it is super memorable, but there are several songs in there that I would pay to have downloaded on my phone.I highly recommend anyone who is even remotely considering this game to pick it up. I wasn't even super excited to get it, but decided to give it a go and now it's my new gaming addiction.",Honestly you need this game,Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: PhysicalVerified Purchase,117 people found this helpful,508,200,Public,75930.0

But it's a little more than that.The gimmick in this one is that you can throw a mind-control hat that allows you to forcefully rule the bodies of other people and creatures; this is probably why Nintendo released the game so close to Halloween in 2017. Mario invades the host like a pathogen and directly controls their motor skills. It's kind of like those parasitic worms that force ants to drown themselves; except you are the worm.Goombas can scream only internally as you force them to smash their heads against blocks for your profit. After your hapless victim is no longer needed, they can be discarded by commanding them to walk off a cliff, right as you return Mario to the physical plane.There's also minigames; such as racing a toy car. But you don't simply throw your hat onto the RC car; oh no. You throw your hat onto a FULLY-GROWN MAN, control his mind, and force his fingers to work the controller in his shaking hands.While mechanically pleasing, I fear that the power given to Mario in this game is too great; and that his character may be crumbl- WAHOO!

Super Mario Odyssey was the first true 3D Mario game we received since 2010 when Super Mario Galaxy 2 released. 3D Land & 3D World were both fun, but they didn't capture the feeling of a true 3D Mario game. In 2017 though we received Super Mario Odyssey!Even though the Switch had been out for less than a year, here we had a game that was hyped up great, but could it live up to the hype?

The story portion is fairly short, and you will practically trip over a power moon every 10 feet to progress to the next kingdom. The game goes on after the theatrics of the story, and it's real content and hours of gameplay depend on if your willing to hunt down the remaining power moons in each kingdom, and thankfully only requires about 600 to unlock the last major challenge and a unique item for beating it.Collecting every last moon however will often force you to complete some incredibly frustrating challenges that had me questioning that this was actually a game and not some attempt to put me in the hospital with a rage induced aneurysm. In particular, the jump rope challenge in New Donk city. Some challenges will require research into advanced jumping maneuvers the game doesn't explain. I wound up refusing to bother with the end-game moon collection until I had the hardest challenges out of the way, since I reasoned it would be wasting time on the rest for game if I knew I'd forever be two moons short of total completion.","Plenty to do if you put the time into it, short on story content.",Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: DigitalVerified Purchase,24 people found this helpful,541,78,Public,166144.0

When I say I ""finished"" it, I mean I FINISHED it. Made it past every single one of the ""endings,"" somehow. At some points, I wanted to rip my hair out in frustration. At others, I really just enjoyed climbing buildings and exploring what the Mario world has to offer (I'll tell you right now that it's a lot. There's a lot). This game occupied me for several weeks, yet somehow I never got bored. I debated even buying this game at first because some people (obviously more experienced gamers than I am) thought it was much too simple. However, i never got over the joy and utter satisfaction of getting a moon that I thought I would never see. Of course, if you just play through the main storyline, you'll be done in a few days. That's to be expected. But Nintendo has put several endings in the game, each significantly more difficult to achieve than the last. I finally finished the entire game weeks after I bought it and let me tell you, I have never felt such satisfaction. I thought I would genuinely have a heart attack trying to get some of those moons. Moral of the story, it's great for all ages and skill levels. A 7-year old could finish the main storyline and never touch it again and probably be content. But *anyone* has the option to keep playing for muuuuuch longer past that. Not the best for multiplayer, but it's still a fun time if someone wants to half-heartedly be a companion to player one.

Forgotten are the sub-par Mario games in between.I have spent only a few hours with the game, but I already have a feel for this one.  First off, it is pretty easy.  You lose coins when you 'die', and coins are literally everywhere.  Seriously, the ground must be made of coins, they're that easy to find.  But the puzzles are luckily pretty interesting.  Many result in discovery of a moon piece.  Others result in; you guessed it; coins.  The maps are larger and you can warp to certain saved locations.The one drawback is that Nintendo insists on making use of the joycons.  I really hate them.  Especially since I play with them attached to the unit while my wife plays PS4.  But I have advanced quite a bit in the game even without using the extra motion control features.  I think they make a few things easier, but I haven't felt like I couldn't accomplish something because I wasn't using them.One nice feature is that the collecting of a moon doesn't take you out of the map (like collecting a star in Mario 64).  So you can collect several each time through and not interrupt the action.  You also then don't have partially completed puzzles reset (like finding and planting seeds in the Desert town).Bottom line is that Nintendo has given us 3 great First-Party games on the Switch (Zelda, Mario Kart, Mario Odyssey).  So it's been a good year for Nintendo fans that were fortunate enough to get a Switch (which I hear is easier now - I got mine on release day).  That being said, I think Zelda is the better game by far, but that doesn't diminish the quality of this game - it's comparing apples to an entire apple orchard.  Zelda is still the Switch game that is a MUST own.  Mario Odyssey is a great game that is superbly polished - but it's still not what action adventure Mario games could be, but it's nearly there.","Nintendo has crafted a polished, fun, and interesting action adventure treat for the fans!",Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: PhysicalVerified Purchase,13 people found this helpful,"8,093","1,970",Public,6689.0

Nintendo forced motion controls in, which are expectedly unreliable and make combat unfair when Mario doesn't react to you movements they way you intend him to because the Joy-Cons don't capture movements correctly. The mandatory motion controls also means that if you want to play Odyssey on the go, you have to play with the Joy-Cons detached and the screen propped up; you can't play the Switch like the WiiU as if it's a giant GBA which is pretty stupid for a console that's entire selling point was its handheld abilities. If we put all that aside, the story is good for a Mario game and the visuals are better than previous Mario games, but that bar was never set very high. Since Mario games have to have a gimmick now, Odysseys is that Mario's hat was destroyed and now he wears a ghost on his head that shapes itself as a hat which Mario an throw at enemies to take control of them. It's an interesting idea and it was fun to play as a Goomba or a T-Rex, but the issue come with combat. Aside from the ground pound, all of Mario's attacks are ""hat"" based; you essentially throw your hat at enemies, which is fine, but when I throw the ""hat"" at a Goomba trying to attack it, the ""hat"" instead goes on the Goomba's head and now I'm controlling the Goomba. The other frustrating things are the unresponsive camera and just plain bad platforming, with Mario not responding to commands (not just motion controls) and seemingly jumping in roughly calibrated directions. I understand that Nintendo games have nuzzled comfortably into a ""Family Games"" category and maybe I'm coming at Odyssey too much as a gamer an not in the Nintendo Fan mindset, but Odyssey is a good Mario game, but really only okay as a game in general. I have some nitpicks about why do you have to buy new hats for Mario, if the ghost(?) is always your hat and can shift into any form it wants, and other minor things. Super Mario Odyssey is a platforming game with bad platforming mechanics on a system that's entire selling point was the ability to play it on the go, that kills that ability to shove in awful motion controls. If I look at Odyssey as a Mario game, it's an acceptable entry, but as a video game (specifically as a platformer) Odyssey doesn't really hit the mark.",Good for a Mario game,Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: PhysicalVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,271,327,Public,33849.0

Unlike some, I refected on my opinion and changed with time. Now I've beaten every major Mario release excluding the Galaxy games. My first introduction to Mario is my earliest memory. Xmas 85 my step grandfather won a NES at a party a couple days before that they got from the original Nintendo test launch. Every adult was jumping while distracted by a scrolling thing. It was so odd how excited they were. Mario World brought graphics and multiple buttons for the best controls at the time. Mario 64 rewrote 3d gaming, acing 3d platforming on its first go and changing how we looked at 3d games. For Odessey I ignored all gameplay and trailers after the E3 presentation as to go in fresh. I judge this as a Mario game so I'm extra critical. So does it live up to the hype? Almost... Gameplay first and it is snappy. The games features dynamic resolution to achieve 60 frames per second. In the PC community there is a saying,""Give me 60 or give me death."" It makes the game control easier, panning the camera and motion is smooth. This makes controlling Mario top notch. Never did I die and think it was the games fault. In fact the input timing at 60fps is so good, going to xenoblade 2 or BotW makes them feel delayed in comparison. The new hat mechanic is an interesting new twist, but at the cost of power ups. Which I did miss. It is fun controlling the enemies, and each have different capabilities to help progress and find moons. Eh the moons. The single laziest thing in the game. There are hundreds of them but you only need a fraction of that to beat the main game and you can buy moons. Yes you can buy moons if you can't get to 600+ on your own. So it's easy to get them and it turns into a collection thing. Collect golden coins, stage coins, moons to collect more stuff. Though I did enjoy getting many of the moons for their challenge they could be replaced with a lot of coins considering I can just buy them. The hat can also whip around using motion to beat lower enemies. It's all well polished, but the motion feels odd at best. The 2d parts are fun but very short. There were moments where I thought this was well thought out or this is really cool, but never did I say WOW! How did they do that?For the game itself. There are coins that you can spend on a shop or death. There are stage coins that buy fitting stage outfits as well as decorations which are useless. Just more busy work. You are trying to save Peach again. Three hit bosses. Very typical. The stages are short. Like not any larger than some Mario 64 stages and there are not that many stages either. The t rex can only be used in a very limited section. This is the main problem of the whole game. Where the fun factor is high, it only lasts 15-20 hours max then you just get moments from then on. I beat the game in under 10hours, and I was exploring. Even the collecting busy work took me 30 hours to get enough to go to the real last stage. Botw lasted me 100 of hours of new exploration. This is padding pure and simple. Level design though small is well polished with a lot of secrets. The level design is the best of any platformers ever but it really really could have used a larger open area to each stage. Graphics are just decent. Look a lot of compromises have been made to achieve 60fps. Mario and npcs look good, as well as locations,  but textures and draw distances are poor. Pop in is really bad and the stages are smaller than you would think. Art style can only hide so much. Sound is excellent. There is no voice acting, but the music and sound effects are stellar. So is Odessey a good Mario game? Yes, however it feels very restrained and easy. That is until the real last stage where it gets very unforgiving to the point it doesn't fit with the rest of the game. In fact with that exception, I think this is accually the easiest Mario yet and gimicky. My kids will have no problem playing this, but even glossing over that. I can't let some nostalgia moments make me forget how short this is and small the ""worlds"" feel.. This is not the best game ever, not a chance, it's not even the best Mario it just tries to remind us of them. Mario3/World are probably the best givend their eras. But it's good. Really good. Like an instant classic and better than Sunshine or anyother modern Mario good. I liked using enemies powers, but it doesn't carry an entire game. It would have been great to get a flying power or jump on Yoshi. Costumes are a cute idea and thank the stars amiibo are not needed. After BotW this might be the second best game of the year. That said it's a fairly distant 2nd for me. But trounced Horizon or anything else. I can't see a bunch of adults excited to play this like the first game. Nor is it mind blowing like Mario 64. Its not revolutionary. Even Cappy kind of mimics Kirby. It's an easy buy, replay value is good and its a perfect platformer. Simply the best 3d platformer. I just wish there where more of it.","Outside the hype, looking past the gimmicks.

But I decided to take the plunge and I'm both glad and sad. Glad that I did it, and sad that I didn't do it before. This is one of the best Mario games in existence. I hesitate it to call it the best ever because being frank there are a couple of titles I haven't played, but I have played the majority, and this one is definitely top 2.The main reason for this is that this game does something that tickles my fancy, which is rewarding exploration. There's a decidedly non-linear nature to the game and while you do have to do a few things before being able to progress, you can tackle most of the world at your leisure and however you feel like it. Sure, every time you reach a new world the game points you in one direction, but you can choose to completely ignore that and travel around each world at your own pace, doing quests, discovering secrets and play around with all your available abilities, which are vast.This is, of course, because now Mario has taken a page from fellow Nintendo companion Kirby, and is able to absorb the abilities of enemies, giving him a wide array of tools to play with. Worlds are large and full of content, a lot of it hidden, which is where exploration comes in. This is far from a Ubisoft game. The world isn't large for the sake of being large. Every nook and cranny is brimming with possibilities, and it's easy to get yourself branching out in different paths and completely forgetting your original goal because you're always discovering something new and intriguing.If I have to give a negative is that the story makes Mario look like an inneffective hero, who's constantly being one-upped by Bowser and only winning at the end because Bowser stopped moving. Granted, the story is usually just window dressing for Mario games (save for the RPG titles, of course), but still, every time the game wrestles control from you for a cutscene you get to see Mario getting his butt handed to him and it becomes a bit irritating. I suggest you just ignore the story and get on with the gameplay, which is absolutely fantastic and it's the only important part of these games anyway.",Excellent game.

I bought this cause I really wanted a second game besides Zelda (which is the reason I bought the Switch) to have to play and “Switch” (see what I did there) between them. Well, that went all out the window once I started playing. First off I’m a gamer. I’ve been gaming since the Atari 2600, yes I’m an old fart 48 yr old gamer but a gamer non the less. I’ve always “liked” Mario but I wasn’t obsessed with him or the franchise. This game, Odyssey, has become my obsession.  I love it. The worlds are excellent, the graphics are insanely beautiful, and the controls are tighter and better then some of the most  sophisticated shooters I’ve played on any platform or PC....if you can faintly hear popping noises in the background it’s all the PC gamers heads exploding across the net as I typed that....well looks like a bunch of moms getting their basements back.  Anyway back to the review. The game is deep and rich and each world is uniquely individual.  The jump between open world platform to side scrolling 2D Classic platform as you enter walls to play these homage Super Mario levels are stunning and too much fun. It’s playable art at it’s finest.  The difficulty isn’t super hard, but it’s challenging.  This isn’t MegaMan...it also isn’t the Smurfs. A death in Game will only cost you 5 coins so it’s hardly a spanking when coins regenerate as you do, so if your so inclined you could actually make money off your own demise. With that said to get to 100% completion will not be easy. As much fun as I’ve had on the first 4 worlds it’s been very rewarding and I’ll still need to revisit these worlds to get everything I didn’t collect through my first pass. I’m only 4 worlds in and I can honestly say it’s my favorite game of the past 5 years. Easy hands down.....and as much as I love Zelda Breath or the Wild....Mario is ....well Mario is better.OMG....you hear more faint noises popping in the distance???",The Best Excuse for Buying a Switch - Perfect Gaming Experience,Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: PhysicalVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,546,165,Public,98646.0

If you, or the person you're buying this for, even remotely likes Mario games, just buy it. Buy this game for kids, adults or anybody who owns a switch and somehow doesn’t own this game yet. Don't wait for a sale (at most this game might go down to $50 with free gift-cards included at some retailers) or try bargaining for this used (Mario Odyssey deserves better than that) and just get this game. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my best friend who just bought a switch and glad to report it was a good choice. I had to tell him before he sprinted to go out and buy the game for himself. Owning a Nintendo Switch and not playing Mario Odyssey is a crime against humanity.In short, this is a spiritual sequel to Super Mario 64 but with better graphics, better gameplay, portability and levels completely different (for the most part) from anything Mario has ever gone through. Like Breath of the Wild, even after beating this game you can keep playing endlessly. Of course, I own my own copy, 80 hours in and only scratching the surface of what's offered here. There are.... hmm...about 10 billion moons for Mario to collect in this game? If you’re worried about the new hat mechanics, honestly, I’m surprised Nintendo didn’t allow Mario to platform on his hat decades ago. If you’re worried about motion controls, you can play this entire game without motion controls, but I consider myself relatively hardcore and prefer playing with motion controls. I also sense significant DLC content coming out for this but no guarantees - right now all we have are creepy Luigi hide-and-seek, balloon games (*sigh* Nintendo ALWAYS shafts Luigi).

I've been craving for a true 3d open world mario game since sunshine and it feels great to have that craving satisfied. It doesn't feel as platforming heavy as sunshine or 64 but more focused on simple exploration.Don't worry however, there are still plenty of platforming levels and a few that are particularly difficult. A kid could still beat this game easily by just picking up the easy moons instead of the harder ones so the difficulty really depends on how you play it. A speedrun community has already popped up and started challenges like the no jump challenge or plain difficult stunts to pull off in game. Overall it's not very difficult a game aside from a few frustrating levels or if you play in a way meant to challenge yourself,but it is loads of fun discovering the new world's and enemit's to capture. If you love to explore and admire nice scenery you'll be sure to enjoy this game.",Love this game,Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: PhysicalVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,15,22,Public,6060173.0

I'm not a big gamer so can't really compare to other games. But it was just OK for me. Lots of stuff to do! Sometimes very cute, liked the costumes. Can really go back and play multiple times. However, I did find the gameplay to be repetitive and not as engaging as some online games. Also didn't like the frequent video sequences. It's family-friendly. I enjoyed it but it didn't take my breath away. The most fun part is probably the thrill of discovery and the cute outfits. Lots of innovative platforming, though the 2d sections were annoying. Chasing moons itself doesn't feel rewarding. Except, Cappy sits on Mario's head, so is he possessing Mario this whole time? and when Cappy is flung on another creature, why does Mario go with him? You see the game has some philosophical stuff to ponder, too. I got my copy on sale.

Hands down the best, most true-to-character Mario game in recent history. This is the essence of what a platform game should be and Nintendo should be proud of themselves for taking their beloved franchise to new levels. Green Mushrooms for all!Honestly, I grew up playing Nintendo. The NES started video gaming for me. And I owned every nintendo system outside of handhelds and the Wii U. However, during my late teens and early 20's, I shifted into playing more ""hardcore"" games on systems like PS2, PS3, PS4, etc.etc. Initially I owned a Wii, but hardly spent any time with it. Basically, I have been out of the Mario scene for some time. The Switch changed that for me.Mario Odyssey rules. Here is the general gist of what this game is all about:Bowser steals Peach (like always) and wants to force her to marry him (like always). Peach has a little animated princess crown companion that just happens to be the heartthrob of Mario's animated hat companion, Cappy. Of course, Mario gotta get his girl back and Cappy is more than happy to oblige helping Mario do this by way of providing Mario new skills. Motivated to help Mario acheive his goals, Cappy brings a new dimension of play in multiple ways.Mario's mission is to travel between different themed worlds in his quest to chase down Bowser. Marios does this aboard a glorified hot air baloon that is powered by a resourced called Moons. Each world has a plethora of moons; some in plain view, some tied to ""quests"" and a WHOLE BUNCH that are hidden behind secret walls, portals, mini games, etc. Collect enough Moons on each world and it unlocks travel to the next world. So on and so forth till you catch up to Bowser.Cappy brings a bunch of new mechanics to Odyssey beyond just being a nifty weapon to use against baddies. Cappy allows you to use elements in the environment to ""possess"" things that allow you to get around each unique world Mario visits. Sometimes you can possess switches that propel you along walls like a rubber band. Other times you can possess power lines and travel as a ball of lightning to different areas. And sometimes you can use Cappy to open doors into challenges that you have to complete hatless and without his help. These can be especially challenging and really give you an appreciation for what Cappy can do for you. The old addage ""you can never truly appreciate something until its gone"" really rings your bell during these challenges.The idea of Cappy being this chameleon companion that can also possess certain types of enemies is pretty cool. I have always wondered what it would be like to be a dreaded goomba (many a killer of Mario) or a fireball-spitting venus fly trap. There is quite a feeling of gratitude when you can finally turn your enemy's weapons against them! For so long I HATED getting fireballed or eaten by those dang venus fly traps popping out of pipes!!!There are also some new enemies for Mario to deal with, as well, and they play an important role in Mario's new adventure. The true GENIUS of this enemy-possessing ability is making it part of the puzzle. The enemies you possess become integral to unlocking secrets and progressing through each world. In fact, you cannot progress without this mechanic.Whether its possessing fish in an underwater tunnel to keep Mario from drowning or using Cappy's Exorcist-style mind control on a frying pan flinging turtleshell so you can destroy giant blocks of cheese YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! The ridiculous level of fun never ends.Outside of using Cappy for all the cool above-mentioned things, the platform experience is truly on point. This IS a Mario game, afterall. Nintendo has even managed to fit in a nice little throwback to the early Mario days via pipes spread out across the different worlds that teleport you to an old-school version of Mario in bit-style graphics armed with only your jump button. Truly retro. Oh, and to top it off, you transform into your 8-bit version WITH your current costume on.Oh, did I forget costumes?? Yes indeed. You can change Mario's outfit to personalize his looks and to also unlock secret areas that require you to be dressed a certain way.The only wish I have for this game is some of the worlds are rather short lived experiences and I wish there was more content. Also, you are forced to travel in a linear fashion from world-to-world even when the road ""forks"" and you are given a choice which one you want to visit first. Even though it would seem like there is a ""progression"" going on, each world is disjointed and theres no real overall ""theme"" to the game other than collecting Moons and chasing Bowser. I never felt like any one world was ""easier"" than the other; there are just different and surprising mechanics going on in each world. This makes each one feel really unique and whimsical, but doesnt lend itself to a cohesive story. The boss fights also become redundant and predictable after a while.While there are a lot of extra Moons you can squeeze out of each world, and you are free to travel between already unlocked worlds, I dont see a lot of replayability in this game other than being a ""completionist"" and really digging to get every list completed. Dont let that detract you from playing, however. This game will constantly surprise you!Hats off to Nintendo (yes I punned you there) for bringing me back to Mario land.

If you don't get Breath of the Wild and you have a switch you are missing out on one of Nintendo's best achievements. So back to Odyssey. The game doesn't feel nearly as extensive as the original one. It is creative at times but borrows so many ideas from the original that it isn't nearly as impressive. The hat mechanic is great. The music is great. But yeah nothing is going to compare to the original soundtrack and creativity.,Reliving the original best game of all time (Super Mario 64) so it's pretty darn good!,Hardware Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardMedia format: PhysicalVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,252,78,Public,1485536.0

Then there are all of the powers you get in the game or what I mean is taking over other characters with your hat so you can get their abilities (almost like Kirby’s swallowing ability), and I believe that’s what makes the game interesting. I haven’t had this much fun with a Mario game since Super Mario World.

I liked being able to explore the castle to find the hidden areas and the random things that went on in there.  Not having a real central area like that in Odyssey was just kind of a major bummer.This game also has probably the closest thing to a real story in a Mario game and TBH it was both annoying and a major dissapointment.

Butt stomping a pile of garbage in new donk city to uncover a moon doesn’t have that same feeling of accomplishment. It feels rushed in a way. So many moons, yet hundreds of the moons are placed throughout the worlds in a way that doesn’t yield a challenge in collecting them. Acquiring some moons will recycle previous experiences. I know what you’re thinking. How can Nintendo create 800+ unique ways of collecting power moons? I understand, but I would rather sacrifice quality of collecting moons over quantity of moons.

The story is predictably stupid. Peach is kidnapped by a frankly rapey giant turtle again. This is the same as it ever was. This time, a living hat named Tiara is kidnapped to serve as Peach's...tiara...in her rapey wedding.  There are psychotic wedding planners that are stripping something from each world for the wedding.  Flowers, dresses, etc.The controls are spot on and as responsive as ever.  The only downside are the somewhat optional motion controls.  They work well to do advanced moves like a homing cap or spin move.  Sadly in handheld mode there are no separate button pushed to make these happen.  That is an oversight. There are certain moments you actually need the motion controls, especially when triggering a spin move or a motion controlled high jump. Shaking the whole unit or pulling out the joycons for a quick moment is frankly a pain.But enough negative, this is a five star review after all. The best thing I can say is that it is Mario perfected and refined. Each little platform challenge is joyous and always falls short of frustrating. Using Cappy to control enemies is a brilliant move by Nintendo, essentially allowing for 50 outfits instead of just a couple. We've come a long way since fire flowers.It is also dense in a way that Zelda was. The Power Moons are nearly as numerous as Korok seeds in Zelda. But the process of getting them is much more fun. Some are as simple as ground pounding a glowing spot on the ground.  Others may find you herding sheep, beating a boss or playing a level inspired by 8 bit mario and the gravity switching of the Galaxy games.Every turn is something new and enjoyable to experience. If by chance you find something you don't love? You'll be on to something new in a minute. It is this relentless pace of newness that makes this game so wonderful. It is all Mario, but it is forever opening new paths.It is also open world in a way we've never seen before in a Mario game. There are a few required missions, but the majority of your time is spent scouring for Moons to power your ship to the next world. It is a Mario game that feels both comfortably familiar and completely new.In short, this is a staggering masterclass in game design and proof that Nintendo has decided after many years to stop refining their classics and begin to redefine them.

I was incredibly excited for Super Mario Odyssey prior to its release, as I am a huge fan of games such as Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy. And I have not been disappointed by this game at all.Basically, in this game, you go to different beautiful locations, run around as Mario and collect objects called Moons, either by simply finding them, defeating enemies, or completing a great variety of other tasks. There are a TON of Moons. Hundreds.Using your new hat, you can take control of fifty-some creatures/random objects, which is really fun. Ever wanted to be a frog? You can be a frog. I won't spoil the multitude of other things you can turn into. This game will really surprise you in that area, especially once you get towards the end of the main story.The controls work well.

I was skeptical about the game before buying, the idea of throwing a cap, visiting a city with other humans, possibly forced motion controls, etc, but I was proved wrong once again by Nintendo. I only play the game docked on the TV with the PRO controller, so I can't comment much on the handheld experience.Gameplay is excellent, the game controls as it should, only the occasional issue with the camera positioning and I've had a couple frame rate issues in certain worlds. Huge variety of tasks in each world, fun mini-games that include global leader boards, taking control of enemies with the cap gives Mario near infinite capabilities throughout the game. Mario also has the capability to turn into a 2D side scroller during certain times in the game to give you that old Mario feeling once again, which is a great touch from Nintendo.Graphics are excellent, I honestly don't need anything the Xbox One X or PS4 Pro produces when the gameplay is so engaging. The cartoonish looks remain from previous Mario games and still plays very well.Music is great, classic Mario music and occasional music from the 2D side scrolling Mario's also give it an added dose of nostalgia.Lasting appeal, the game is BIG. I was worried how long the game was, but when I read that there's over 900 Power Moons to collect, I was so excited to spend more time in these worlds. While I haven't finished the game, I plan to put a lot of hours into it.While I can't say it's better the Zelda BOTW, it's clearly on it's level and that's saying a lot.

It is a full-length, single-player plat-former that serves as Nintendo's defiance of recent video game industry trends.  It's a game that will always be amazing.  It's also proof that Nintendo understands it's core audience.  The game designers at Nintendo have transcended pixels and graphics and have created a piece of living art that has a life of it's own.Why is the game so good?  Let's start with the practical side of things... The gameplay is intuitive, smooth, and simply perfect.  You can have fun with this game by just moving around and jumping.  Every action is pleasing to your senses.  In addition, the game is packed with challenges (both easy and difficult) that will keep your interest throughout.  Nintendo's goal was to bring joy to their players.  Not all games can claim this...Why else is the game so good?  During a time that other video games are more about photo-realistic graphics, online multiplayer mode, pwning other players, pay-to-win, non-linear gameplay, and loot boxes, this game proves that the classic formula of full-length single-player games still reigns supreme.  I paid $60 for this game, and I will be able to play it, and enjoy it, forever.  Literally, I will revisit this game from time to time for as long as I can.
