These have become my favorite go-to socks.  Seriously.  They are thick and cushiony (not for shoes that are already tight).

What I like even more than that is the fact these stay where you want them!Omg, GONE are my days of that horrible feeling when my footies slowly slip down my shoe until they’re off my heel completely.  These socks stay put and that additional little “tab” at the heel is the single reason and it’s absolutely perfect.  When I first considered buying these socks, I wondered whether or not I’d feel that little tab.  Well I didn’t.  It’s not like feeling something foreign attached to the heel of your sock (like those little pom-poms back in the day), this is just part of the sock with just the right amount of thickness to keep it in place.For reference, I bought size medium. I typically wear a woman’s 9.5 shoe and these socks are not tight at all.  They don’t need to be stretched onto my foot.  Perfect wiggle room.  They just slide right on as if they were made for my feet.  No kidding.I really love these socks.  I’ve bought them twice now and plan to keep buying them.Oh, and in case you’re wondering, I did NOT receive these for free and I have NOT been given any type of discount.  I haven’t been given anything.  I pay full price every time.

I am athletic and have worn thousands of socks in my days.  Since I cannot conduct scientific experiments to determine the fabric content of socks, I have to go by what I believe is fairly reliable.  No, not the burn test.  I just cannot bring myself to lighting socks on fire.  At least not yet.So my less than scientific cotton content sock tests are the stretch test and the slippery toe test.  Yep.  They have a 88.3 accuracy rate, as determined by the results of brute stretching abilities and by wet toes following a Houston humid 100 degree jog or just about anything else done in our crap summer weather.Here is the deal ... the seller's quoted and portrayed certificate has little credibility with me.  Even if the certificate is from a reputable lab, following reputable testing procedures, we have no way of knowing if the sock tested is the same sock sold.  So what is my honest and fair review?  It follows:The socks are a homerun in many ways.  They are fairly thick, appear well made, have good style, are very soft.  They appear nicer than most socks I own.  I have the white and the black.  They are identical, except for the color.  I don't know yet how they will hold up, as I have only had them a few days.  But it is highly possible they become the last worn before laundry day.  So before I did much of anything, I put a pair on and started working on my backyard putting in a rock path.  Hard work in 97 degree humid houston muck.  My toes quickly became slicky slick.  Quickly.  And never improved.  The next day with a fresh pair of socks and a cold shower, I went to the DMV to renew my drivers license.  Though two very tough tests for socks, both had the same results.  Slicky toes.  Hot, sweaty feet.  ON to my other test.  Stretch time.  I just wish I had better news.  These socks stretch willingly.  Just too much to be 88.3 cotton.  If either test proved cotton to me (dryer feet or minimal stretch), I'd endorse as possibly accurate cotton content.  I just cannot.  No idea what % of what, but wet feet and stretchy stretch?  So close to a perfect sock.

After washing, they are about as long as my hand. I have somewhat small hands for a man.  They are also low-fitting, coming just to the ankle but not over. Not suitable for a high top shoe. Quality seems quite high. Good, thick material with good elastic.UPDATE 9/26/19 (Sock is on my hand and turned inside out to display the seams in the attached picture)The company was kind enough to send me an extra large pair, so I feel obligated to revise and give them a more thorough review. I took the new pair out for a test hike today, and this is my take. As I stated previously, the material on the bottom is quite thick and offers a good deal of cushion. Something I hadn't noticed the first time is that the top of the sock is a bit thinner and employs a mesh-type weave that allows heat and moisture to pas through for a cooler, more comfortable feeling than if the entire sock were as thick as the bottom and sides. Quite clever I think. The extra-large should fit perfectly once washed as they do shrink. I would not recommend them for anyone over a men's size 10 or 11. Another nice design is there is no heavy seam at the toe like many socks have, so nothing rubbing against the toe tips. I've gone through many low-top socks over the years, and these are probably the best designed/manufactured I've owned. I'll have to look and see if the same company makes a higher top sock as well, because I like how they make their product. Highly recommended, but men should order 2 sizes bigger than they think they need.","Really nice sock but runs small, especially after washing",Color: White&greySize: LargeVerified Purchase,20 people found this helpful,"1,132",543,Public,9222.0

The supposedly ""cushioned"" areas are simply the thickness of normal socks, where the rest is quite thin.Similarly, these are advertised as having arch support. They do not. And a simple change in the fabric pattern doesn't mean they provide actual support. Again, this seems to be an issue due to how thin the socks are in general.I'm disappointed because the old cushioned running socks with decent arch support I've always liked were discontinued, and these - on the surface at least - sounded like a good replacement. Sadly, they're not. If you like a very thin sock, these might be great for you. But if you plan to put them through even moderate use athletically or you rely on real arch support and targeted cushioning, pass on these.","Too thin (not ""cushioned"") and no actual arch support",Color: Black&greySize: LargeVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,901,131,Public,5336.0

Can't find it? You're not alone, and this is the best alternative to time travel.Allow me to digress.I cannot even tell you how many hours I spent searching for a replacement of the late, wonderful Hanes 88% cotton no-show sock. At some point between my last two purchases, they switched to a lower cotton percentage (70%?) and attempted to justify their cheapness with words like 'performance' 'cool-tech' and 'moisture wicking'.Allow me to assure you, the new formulation is in no way superior in these ways to the old one.While this may seem like a small change, as the attached photo shows, the New Hanes barely tolerate a few wears/washes before deteriorating into a mass of hideous pills, not to mention their static and hair-accumulation powers (I picked off the hairs from the 'new hanes' sock for the photo. You're welcome.)Even though the Old Hanes sock is *years* older at this point, thanks to the higher cotton content (88?) it looks newer than the 'new' sock. So sad Hanes. You lost a loyal customer.Which bring us to the CelerSport sock (88.3% cotton). As you can see in the photo, even after a couple months-worth of washes, it is nearly pill-free, and while you cannot feel it, let me assure you that it *feels* like the Old Hanes, unlike the slippery, polyester-feel New Hanes sock.They are cushiony, just like the Old Hanes.They are absorbent, just like the Old Hanes.They don't feel like cheap-a$$ polyester, à la New Hanes.They can be washed, over and over, without festooning themselves in pills.The 'support' band around the arch feels nice.Are they 100% cotton?No, and if you really, really insist on 100% cotton, there are a few ugly/expensive options out there. Most of them are thin and don't stretch well, as I learned the hard way.These CelerSport socks filled the hole in my wardrobe which was so cruelly vacated by Hanes' shameless fabric reformulation.

I know “No-show” socks are very popular. But I bought for keeping my toes warm, summer and winter, but had to be mostly all cotton. These were the closest I could find.

Just enough acrylic for stretch but mostly all cotton. I LOVE THESE!!! Got them in white (let’s me know when my floors need cleaning!!!!). They are thick enough to keep my toes from being numb from A/C!!! They come up around my ankles which make them even cozier. And does not leave a ring around my ankles, due to water retention . I have been using 3 pairs of crazy old cotton socks, since you can’t find mostly cotton in any stores! Now, I am in heaven. Also need to keep special lotions on feet to keep them soft every night and these will be heaven wearing to sleep at night with my creams on. Like wearing gloves to keep your overnight lotion on, keeping moisture on your hands. I have stayed home for many months due to this Virus and wearing socks all day n night. I don’t wear house shoes or flip flops. Socks are the BEST thing to wear round the house. Keeps feet clean in between showers. No flopping off or tripping with shoes. It is very important to keep my feet dry from sweating!  Feet sweat!  Especially in fuzzy house shoes. Wear socks made of Cotton! Order one or two sizes up!  You won’t regret it. Give your toes space so they won’t curl up! These have cushion in all the right spaces. These are Not the Greatest most expensive socks, but fabulous price for the Quality of these socks. I think if I could find these in a store, they would be very difficult to find and the cost for 6 pairs would easily be over $40 for a few pair. You won’t need to worry if these come from another country and What will you get??? You will be Very pleased! Five stars!  Happy customer. I am putting another pack of six in my new cart.

Who knows if the company will actually receive the returned item?  So I pay with PayPal or if this is not an option, I call my bank to dispute charges. Do not pay for Inferior products!!!!!!

When I worked out on the stepper with my old socks, they often slipped and bunched up in the same spot, rubbing up and causing blisters. However, it turns out on these socks, that padding actually works. I find it adds both stretch reinforcement when putting them on, as well as some chafe protection. The slight bulk causes no issues when I wear these in my high tops or boots, either.The truth is, like a lot of guys, I don't often spare time pondering athletic socks.

I've worn these running and to the gym and they are great.Fit and ActivityThese socks do not slide off as you work in them and fit very well.  I am a 10.5 men's US size shoe and I bought the large socks.  I really like the tab design which makes them easy to put on.  My one concern when buying them was if the band around the ankle and the band around the arch support would be too tight.  You can clearly see from the design that these were engineered into the sock, but some socks will do a poor job at this, either making it too loose or bulky or too tight and uncomfortable.  These socks hit it just right.  I cannot tell those bands are there while wearing them, but if I take my fingers and tug on those areas, they are clearly more snug and supportive.  These socks also don't have any weird designs and patterns other socks have that end up digging into parts of your feet and cause discomfort.  Everything was designed for optimal functional use.A Little BonusOn the inside of the ankle, there is a small sewn ""L"".  I imagine this is great for couples or families that buy multiple pairs of varying sizes.  This would help identify matching pairs.Get these!  I replaced all my low-cut socks with them.
