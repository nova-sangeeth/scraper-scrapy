A lot of fun.  However, I do have some complaints. I am a noob and it took a lot of work, looking online, youtube videos, and going through the menus to try to figure out what the game was even about, how to win, etc.  It also does a pretty poor job of tutorials and the menus aren't very intuitive.  There are a lot of confusing mechanics and options in the menu and the translation to english in the tutorials seems like there is something lost in translation. Additionally, I got it for a party tonight, excited that there would be 74 fighters as advertised, but only 8 are available.  Fighters are randomly unlocked by playing the game for hours.  You might unlock 2 in 1 hour or play for 4 and unlock none.  Plus you have no control of who gets unlocked.  Excited to play as Snake or Bayonetta?  Good luck.  Literally.  Unlocking them is just random luck.  Kind of a shame for people that just want this as a party game and don't want to put in all the effort and time to unlock all the characters that were alluded to being available.  Still fun, once you put in the time, unlock the characters, and figure out how to play, I think it will be fantastic.",Not very accessible for newcomers.,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,665 people found this helpful,783,83,Public,171615.0

Michael,amzn1.account.AGEEWBI44SKWBIFN4BKKLLWBE25A,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2018",0,,https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Switch/product-reviews/B01N5OKGLH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My preorder from another store came Thursday afternoon, so I've been playing with my kids for about eight hours. It totally lives up to expectations. It's in no way perfect, but there's just so much good that I don't see how anybody can be sad. It's a game I'm going to be playing for years, and I'm going to enjoy it for years. If you're a parent, your kids will love playing with all their friends. If you're a returning player, all the nostalgia and great Smash gameplay is here. If you're new to Smash, this is a great game to play with other people.When you first boot up, you'll have access to eight characters: Mario, DK, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Starfox, and Pikachu. Unlocks happen pretty quick, but we'll see how long it takes to unlock all 74 characters. I love some of the new costumes like the Mario Wedding costume. I read an online unlock guide that said if you quit the game after unlocking a character and play another quick round that you'll unlock lots of characters quickly. When I say quit the game I mean to exit the game on the Switch home menu. That's worked well so I did that for a while on my Switch to unlock quickly so I could play with lots of characters. I didn't tell my kids about this because I want unlocking on their Switch to be more organic and slower.Lots of characters have pretty big differences in how they play and lots of characters have small differences and lots is the same. I don't even know what to tell you. Switching out pokemon with pokemon trainer is really fast. You can detonate Link's bombs remotely. The basic gameplay is the same so Smash fans will pick up on things really fast. I still think that Smash is the best game for fighting game beginners because the controls are very simple.Gameplay is faster than the past few games. This can make battles more crazy. The only complaint about faster gameplay is that it's harder to keep up with both your character and everything else that's happening on the board. I've lost my character a number of times. I almost wish we could get an option for colored outlines for all the characters. I might just be out of practice, so we'll see if this is still an issue after a while.Is it balanced? There are 74 characters--who knows! And since Smash for Wii U had balancing updates, this will be different in a year from now. I will say that the kids and I have fought with all sorts of characters and nobody's thought that any seemed overpowered. We're just barely starting to see the changes to characters and how new characters work and we're still unlocking characters. The Smash community will be finding things out for months and opinions are going to change over and over.I love that you can save rulesets. You can customize the game heavily with more or less stuff. You can have lots of items or no items or specific items or more lives or change the Final Smash options. It's really cool to have all your quick pick favorites but at the same time making rulesets is a little slow. I feel that as I get rulesets made that I'll really like it. Today being new, I've really wanted to make a tweak between games and it's been kinda slow because of all the options available. We are a two switch family and it's going to be a pain to make all our rulesets twice. I really wish there was some way to bring rulesets with you.I don't know how it could be done better, but the stage select is just one big picture of little tiny squares. It's almost too much. I wish there were an option to show you like 12 random stages rather than all of them. We've mostly played on random so far because it's overwhelming!The graphics and animation takes a step up from the Wii U more than I thought it would. The stage graphics are awesome and there are so many new touches that are really cool. The N64 stages feel updated but classic. It runs very smoothly in tv mode and we've not played in handheld mode.The music is awesome. There's just so much variety. It all sounds like it's made on a computer, but it's all really good music. I hear there are over 800 tracks...Controls feel great. The joycons aren't the perfect smash controller. The thumbsticks can't keep up with a good player. The pro controller is better, but the gamecube controller just feels right. Maybe I'm nostalgic, but I'm really enjoying playing with the gamecube adapter. My daughters prefer the joycon because that's really the controller they know. My 11 year old son also likes the gamecube controllers (but I guess he could be feeding of my choice). If you're really serious about the game, I really suggest your getting the gamecube adapter. Mine that came with Super Smash Bros Wii U works great, but I see they're selling it separate now. It sold out quite a few times in the Wii U era, so you might want to pick one up now!Local multiplayer is awesome. I think you can play with 8 players on every stage. We've had five people playing lots of battles and it's been a whole lot of fun. This is Smash Bros to us!We don't play online, so I'm just ignoring that. I'm sure lots of people will be talking about how crappy it is or laggy or great or amazing or horrible. We play with family, with friends, with church youth, and with anyone around a TV.World of light is the single player story mode. My first impression is that it's not as good as Sub-Space Emissary from Smash Brawl, but it looks like a decent way to play alone and unlock more stuff. Kinda like I don't play online, I don't play the story mode that much. My son is excited about it, so I'm glad it's here. I'll just let others who want story mode more review it better. Collecting spirits to affect your character and the stage seems really cool, but I hear that it just means that the uniqueness of the stages go away so all the stages seem the same. You will run into stages with fog. If you have a spirit badge that takes away fog, it just makes it another normal Smash battle. We'll see how fast it gets old for my son.They've said there will paid and free DLC. Piranha Plant will be free DLC for early adopters and will be available early next year. There will be 5 paid DLC packs that each has 1 new fighter, one new stage, and music tracks. The first one will be a Persona 5 character! They haven't announced any others yet. These packs will be six dollars each or 25 for the set. They haven't set a date for the DLC but they've said all 5 packs will be available by 2020. I assume one will come every few months.Overall, it's an awesome game. With the free Piranha Plant, you get 75 fighters to pick from. There are over 100 stages. There's just so much Smash. It plays great and it's a lot of fun. I totally suggest this!",How will they ever top this game?,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: Standard,284 people found this helpful,"15,297","6,154",Public,605.0

It’s just how their servers are set up. One person lags, everyone lags. It’s a problem Noted in lots of discussion forms. Also note this was a problem on previous platforms like the Wii U and was never fixed, so don’t count on Nintendo to fix it anytime soon. I’ll update this review if that changes.You can’t really select any of your preferences for a game. You will get put in a 1v1 or 4v4 depending on what the game wants.

I am no means a ""pro"" when it comes to playing Smash Bros. but this game is the best I have played since it's first iteration.Let this be a disclaimer for all the people who have never played a Smash Bros game before, this game is overwhelming and taking it all in is a task within itself. Look at it this way, you bought a Tesla on the sheer fact that it's an electric car, only to find it has so many features you have to read a manual, but when you finally grasp the aspects of the car the reward is tremendous! So my advise to you is to take in each feature, one by one, and indulge in each of it's aspects. What you will find is a deep and enriching gaming experience that captures what Nintendo is all about, and at the same time you will learn how to truly Smash... your opponent into oblivion.Like most Smash Bros. enthusiast I loved melee, and deemed it the best of the the series as Brawl ruined my favorite character (fox) and other aspects of what Smash Bros is, but when the Wii U version came out, I loved that game because it was released on the 3DS and I can play Smash Bros. where ever I want when I want and it has an interesting mix of melee and brawl. Now we have Smash Bros. Ultimate and it's on the switch, it's portable like the 3DS version, it looks amazing graphically, and it leans more towards Melee in terms of its gameplay and speed but not so much that it's hard to pick up and play. In other words, it's has the best aspects of the series in a amazing package and did I mention that the switch makes it portable :).In short, this game is a must have. There is 100's of hours of game play in a small cartridge and is worth your time to invest. Again, if you don't have time, it's portable so you can indulge when ever and where ever you want in what could possibly be, the best switch game yet!",Truly Ultimate... if you take your time with the game.,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,24 people found this helpful,231,70,Public,859718.0

Why am I forced to pay for an online subscription when the game connects of a p2p  network and every match is filled with lag to the point where it is not even enjoyable. Not to mention when you set your settings for 1v1 preferred matches you never get what you want and are then put into FFA lagfests.

Jordan,amzn1.account.AHACEDQMP46KC75JLAHRLUMBNI5A,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018",0,,https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Switch/product-reviews/B01N5OKGLH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by saying Super Smash Bros. has always been a fighting game franchise I've held dear since my childhood. Each new entry seemed to completely raise the bar, thereby raising my expectations for what kind of surprises were in store for us. And as far as the character reveals go, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate boasted a good amount of surprises for the fans. Lots of heavily requested fighters such as King K. Rool, Ridley and Simon Belmont finally graced the roster. However, I just don't see how they can call this the ""Ultimate"" version of Smash when so much was taken out in exchange for a larger than normal stage and fighter number. So this brings me to the ultimate question (sorry for the overuse of the word ""ultimate"" btw). Was what we gained better than what we lost? That's a difficult question for me to answer. Instead, I'll just spill my thoughts. Let's continue with the review.Part 1: Presentation. The formula of Super Smash Bros has remained relatively the same since its debut in 1999. Its control scheme is pretty unique for a fighting game. But, it works excellently. There are no 15-button combos, but a series of standard, special, and aerial attacks that can be used in whichever sequence you see fit. The objective of the game is to rack up damage on your opponents by beating them to a pulp using your wide variety of moves, items, assists etc. and then launching them off the stage. I simply adore the chaotic gameplay of Smash bros. and so do millions of people, hence the large fanbase. However, there are some people in this world who have never played a Smash game before (shocking, right?). I just feel the game could do a better job in presenting itself to newcomers. The ""how to play"" video doesn't show up until after the game's opening. How will people know to wait after the logo comes on the screen? Other than that, the menu is very clean and straightforward this time around. It only takes 3 button presses to get into a match with you and your buds. I also want to take this time and applaud the beautiful design of the menus. There is a nice mix between simplistic graphics and in-game images. It honestly deserves an award. Not only that, its easier than ever to add up to 8 players to a match, set up custom match rules and edit controller configurations. So much care went into making the experience pleasurable.Part 2: Gameplay. Like I mentioned above, the gameplay of Smash Bros. remained the same. But, this time around, the overall speed has been upped a bit, making the gameplay a tad faster than Smash 4, but a tad slower than Melee. And I gotta say, it really feels great. Since the speed of the game changed, so did some of the animations of the fighters. Taunts, for instance, are quicker and don't leave you vulnerable for as long.  And when you launch a fighter, they propel a lot faster and a lot farther. This makes it a bit harder to execute combos, sadly. Despite the faster gameplay, I am AMAZED at how fluid the movements of the fighters still are, as well as how nicely animated some of their new moves are. This game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 fps, despite all the chaos happening on the screen. I'd give this game an A+ in this department. It's not hard to understand why the gameplay of Smash hasn't changed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Part 3: Content. This is where things get dicey. One could argue that having 70+ characters and 100+ stage options qualifies as a hefty amount of content. However,a lot-and I mean ALOT of the features/modes from the prior smash bros. games have been cut. I'm going to start by telling you what you get with this game. There is your standard ""Smash"" mode, which houses local multiplayer matches. Standard Smash is for 2-8 players. If you have an even larger group of people wanting to play, you'll be glad to know there's a tournament mode. A new multiplayer mode called ""squad strike"" makes its debut in this game. In this mode, you can challenge a buddy and both of you use a ""squad"" of 3 or 5 characters to participate in elimination-style matches. Other than that, you can also mess around with the rules in the multiplayer matches. The mode ""special"" smash makes a return. Playing this mode, will allow you to fight with a variety of battle parameters (make your fighter faint after taking a certain amount of damage, make your fighters large, make them metallic, etc). Next, we have ""Spirits mode"", which houses this game's campaign mode, ""World of Light"". This could take a while to wrap up, so i'll try to be brief. Those of you who are familiar with Smash Bros may remember collecting ""trophies"" which are in-game collectible 3D models of characters who are both in and not in the game. In prior games, there were tons of ways you could unlock trophies, which added hours upon hours of more content. In this game, trophies are gone, but their spirits are carried through...well, spirits. The whole gimmick of ""Spirits mode"" is fighting,collecting and leveling up spirits, which are obtained by completing matches with a plethora of wacky parameters.  So, what are spirits? They're basically the souls of characters who appeared in various games. In this game, they're represented by flat 2D images, rather than 3D models like the trophies were. When you ""equip"" a spirit, you attain its powers, which in some way, are related to the spirit itself. In super smash bros. brawl for wii, you may remember ""stickers"", which are  almost the exact same thing, but you can't level them up. The whole mechanic of ""spirits"" is fully brought into play in the ""World of Light"" campaign mode. This time around, a new foe named ""Galeem"" has reared his ugly head and claimed the bodies of all the fighters (except Kirby) and is making clones of them. To make these clones fight, he uses the spirits he claimed from non-important characters and embeds them into the clones so that they become animate. Your job is to rescue all of your fallen comrades and restore light to the world. In this mode, you traverse a large, and I mean LARGE map, taking on the clones (with spirits inside them) in a variety of silly matches. Should you beat the clone at their own game, you free the spirit within and you can use their powers to help you free more spirits. Spirits are leveled up naturally by fighting. The better you do in a fight, the more EXP your spirit gets. Playing a good match can also net you ""skill points"" which can be used to unlock extra stats on top of the  ones you get with spirits. When you travel across the map, you will run into your comrades being held captive. If you defeat them in a regular match, you will free them and that means you not only get to use then in World of Light, but in every other mode in the game as well. Each section of World of Light's map has a boss. Defeat that boss and you're one step closer to confronting Galeem. Anyway, you keep going through the cycle of fighting,rescuing spirits,rescuing fighters and taking down bosses for the whole campaign mode. I have yet to complete this mode, but it goes on for a while. My gripe with ""World of Light"" is that it becomes repetitive after a while. These matches with the crazy battle parameters  make up about 90% of the campaign and are, in theory, just matches that you can replicate by messing around with the rules in ""Smash mode"". This honestly feels like event matches with an unnecessary rpg mechanic slapped on it. Also, the difficulty is all over the place. Some matches are fairly easy and in others, you'll get your can kicked to and fro. Anyhoo, let's keep going. Next, we have ""Classic Mode"", which is no stranger to us Smash fans. In this mode, you select a character, take on a series of matches and fight a boss at the end. However, this classic mode is a bit different than the ""classic"" modes we're used to. And by ""different"", I mean worse. First off, classic mode has been shortened by like 5 matches. Second, there is only one bonus game that you play between matches, and its the same for every fighter and every difficulty you choose. It's a little obstacle course where you collect yellow orbs and race to the end before a black hole swallows you. I just don't understand why they couldn't have at least added different layouts for the obstacle course. In prior games, there were ""break the targets"" bonus stages that had multiple layouts. Lastly, classic mode ends with a boss. **SPOILER ALERT IN 3...2....1...(SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED)There are only 6 bosses in the game. And in a game with over 70 characters, this means you'll be fighting the same ones over and over.  And lo and behold, these are the EXACT six bosses you'll fight in the campaign mode.**SPOILERS OVER**Alright, next I want to cover the online mode. I knew from when it was first unveiled, it would be a mess and I was right. There is no longer the ""For fun"" and ""For Glory"" options that were in Smash Bros. for Wii U. There is only the Quickplay option in which you set your match preferences and HOPE you and another player have the same idea of a good match. More often than not, you will be forced to play in 4-player matches if you don't want to play 4-player matches and 1-on-1 matches when you don't feel like playing a 1-on-1. Also, there is noticeable lag (Oh boy, what a surprise) when playing online. Apparently, the game does its best to set you up against players close to you, but if one player has bad internet, everyone suffers.Part 4(UPDATED AS OF AUGUST 2019):The Cutting Board. This is where I want to talk about features than many considered to be standard for Smash games, but for some reason, don't show up in Ultimate. My main problem with this game is that I feel Nintendo stripped the extra content and modes that made Smash Bros. a truly enjoyable experience, leaving behind what the game is at its core: a party fighting game. Nintendo seems to be on this trend lately with games like Mario Tennis Aces, ARMS, Star Fox Zero and Mario Kart 8, where modes that offered a great subsidiary to the main gameplay formula (multiplayer modes, mini game modes, battle modes etc) that were present in PAST TITLES are nowhere to be seen. And I absolutely HATE that Smash had to be a part of this trend. And this most disappointing part of this is that the Switch is Nintendo's 2nd HD game console. We should be getting games that absolutely push the boundaries of what past games were restricted to. Other developers are making their sequels bigger and better, but for some reason, Nintendo is holding back content from their games. It just doesn't make sense. It's as if whenever they take 1 step forward, they have to take 2 steps back. Sorry for the small rant, here are the features that Smash Ultimate lacks. First, mini-games like ""Break the Targets"", ""board the platforms"" and ""Home run contest"" are absent. I feel these games would have been PERFECT for an online leader board functionality. Second, Single player modes like ""All-star"" and ""event match"" are absent.UPDATE: Stage Builder mode, which was a feature of the last 2 Smash games, was added via  an update and it's amazing how much care went into designing the new components and objects you can play around with. This stage builder easily trumps the other two. Not only that, Tournament mode was added. I' ve decided to bump up my rating by one star to accommodate these additions. Thanks for listening to the fans, Mr. Sakurai.Lastly, I want to talk about unlocking methods. You start the game with the original 8 characters that you started with in the Nintendo 64 game, yet all of the stages are unlocked. This baffling to me. In prior smash games, you would have to unlock stages and characters by completing certain requirements. Some of which were very unique and creative, making unlocking the character/stage a truly rewarding experience. With Ultimate, all of that is gone. You simply unlock characters by playing multiplayer matches, classic mode matches or via the ""World of Light"" campaign. If you want to bring back the nostalgic feel of putting effort towards unlocking something, you need to do it with the stages as well.Part 5: The verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a truly great game at its core. Its gameplay has even been tweaked and refined, further enhancing the experience. However, most of what you'll be doing in this game is playing standard matches, whether it be against a CPU or a few buddies. Many of us were looking forward to a fully fleshed-out adventure mode, but its basically a series of event matches-something we've seen before. And all of the great passtimes like home-run batting, trophy collecting,""break the targets"" or stage building are nowhere to be seen. And the one mode we do have that was present in past games, ""Classic"" mode has been watered down. By no means am I saying this is a terrible game. It's just that I was expected what added to the charm of Smash Bros. to be included in this installment. And I'm very well sure the developers know that we sometimes can't get everything we want. I don't feel ripped off, because there is very well $60 worth of content in this game. And with the addition of fan favorite characters like Banjo-Kazooie coming soon, I am very grateful to the dedication of the development team. Thanks for reading and happy gaming.",A well-crafted fighting game that still packs a punch,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,23 people found this helpful,40,7,Public,12752867.0

I will only go over what is different this time around so hold on to your seat. First things first, Here’s a pro tip for any Meta Knight mains, I need you to scroll to the top of the page, close Amazon and go back to For Honor where you obviously main Orochi (pls give Like if you got the joke) but really though. The first thing you want to do is go right into spirits mode, because you only get 8 or so characters to start. Any character you unlock in spirits mode will automatically join you in regular smash, however any character you unlock by triggering the “A new challenger appears” fight, will not be added to spirts. The best way I can describe this mode is a mix between Pokemon and Mario party, you and your opponents can equip spirits (that have replaced trophies) that can give you boosts like, improved jumps, stronger attacks, fire resistance, etc. And the ultimate goal is to equip spirits that counter your opponent’s. Although once you have your favorites leveled up enough it’s possible to just tank your way throughout most of the battles. Except for a few annoying ones. And get comfortable because this mode took me 15 hours to complete with only a 80% completion rate. I suggest you tough it out because the final act really makes the grind worth it.The entire Game has received minor graphical upgrades, as for the fighters themselves, all have obtained animation tweaks that give them more personality overall, Mario has a cooler down smash, Zelda has a new costume and can now throw energy beams with his sword at full health (A little inside joke for the Nintendo vets) Every part of the game really makes it feel like they put they’re heart and soul into it. The amount of content packed in here is astounding. Even the settings/rules you’re allowed to play with can be overwhelming at times, but don’t worry, you can save and name your custom rules so you can get back into the action quicker. Also be sure to take advantage of the ability to pick 2 stages and morph between them. Home run contest and target practice are gone, Because they had to save space somehow. But Here’s the real tragedy. I think all of us veterans know that picking the right color makes us play better, and some alternative colors where cut. Are they really expecting us Mario mains to go online and fight those Malakas Meta Knight mains without his fire flower outfit?! (AC fans where you at?) in all seriousness though, this game is a love letter too all the Smash fans that have been with this franchise throughout the years. Do yourself a favor. Buy this game and good luck online. If you enjoyed this review be sure to like, comment, and subscribe!Update; So they added 2 new DLC characters, Piranha Plant and Joker from Persona 5. Look up gsmVoiD to get in-depth look at both characters. And be sure to use P Plant’s neutral Special attack on opponents trying to get back on the stage if you like cultivating salt in amounts that the world has never seen.

There are a number of World of Light fights that I'm pretty sure were never actually tested.  They're completely unfun, and you spend your time praying for good RNG or broken AI instead of actually fighting.  The online matchmaking is awful, and you're often put into rulesets you didn't ask for.  And the overall character balance leaves a bit to be desired.  Great that you included so many characters in the game, but you're essentially throwing all hopes of ever balancing it out the window.

There is just so much content in this game that I can already see myself having 100+ hours in it. I'm making this review because there was some concerns that I read in some other reviews and I want to point out some things.There was a review that talked about how you start off with 8 characters and how it was not advertised above. Although I cannot confirm the second statement as I did not read it, starting with 8 characters is true. The truth is, this game's 72 characters are unlocked every 10 minutes which if you do the math means a seriously long time. How to fix this? Play a match with 20 minutes facing any CPU on any stage with a lot of room. Once done you should see a new challenger. Beat them and exit out the game. Re-enter in the game and play again only this time with one live and self destruct at the start of a match. You should get another challenger. Rinse and repeat until you get all the characters and if it doesnt pop up anymore, redo the first method and follow the same progress. I have used this method and unlocked 53 characters and I could have done more if my switch didnt die or I wanted to eat. (I searched and found that I only played this game for 6 hours in my profile).One review said that it doesnt teach you how to play the game which is completely 1000000% false. When you enter in the game on the smash ultimate logo, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING. A video pops up to tell you how to play that any child can learn from.This review is already super long so I'll end this by stating that there are ALREADY videos on how to find things on the menu, unlock things, and many others. If you are complaining here without even doing your research then clearly you arent doing your homework.I recommend watching a Youtuber called ""Zerowondering"" who was ranked the best player in Smash Wii U/3DS and posts videos on how to do ""this and that"" in Ultimate.

The audio in this game is INSANE! I've never seen a game with so much musical variety on top of all new voice acting and sound effects.+ Many franchises represented with fighters, stages, music, spirits, and challenges.

There are other new characters.+ Very fun to play with a lot of friends! 8 player Smash on a projection screen is still a blast!+ Multiple control options.

More options than previous games.In-Betweens:o All fighters can now be unlocked thanks to patch 1.2. Previously it was near-impossible for a non-competitive or casual player to unlock all the fighters due to super-aggressive AI.o Online play is smooth and tries to respect your preferences. Prior to patch 1.2, the online was laggy and would put you in matches you didn't want to play.o Nintendo seems very disconnected from their players. They don't seem to be able to interact with casual Smash fans without sending the hyper-competitive group into a meltdown.Cons:- ""Everyone is here"" is not actually true! Charizard is not a standalone fighter anymore and has been tied back to Pokemon Trainer. Nintendo really should release a patch that gives the option to play Charizard standalone again. Being forced over to Squirtle upon KO is a problem. The competitive player argument that Charizard was always intended to be part of Pokemon trainer does not satisfy the casual crowd. It was fun to play standalone Charizard! Nintendo, please fix!- Gatekeeping online community of hyper-competitive players who care more about tier lists and frames than fun. Very difficult to get Nintendo to pay attention to genuine problems when the elite players are constantly screaming for nerfs and more difficulty while suppressing everyone else.- Starting roster is only the original 8 fighters from the N64 days. You must unlock 67 other fighters. Ridiculous! Takes a long time to unlock all fighters even when using workarounds. Not acceptable in a full priced game.- Adventure mode is highly repetitive. It could have used some side-scrolling, beat-em-up levels like mini-Subspace Emissary or Smash Run experiences. It can take a long time to unlock new fighters in adventure mode.- Some features are missing. No stage builder, home run contest, target smash, and some other classics. Not a huge loss, but still curiously absent staples of the franchise.- Online system does a terrible job of separating competitive players from casual players.- No Miiverse doodle fun.I've owned every Smash game since the original N64 game. Smash can be a fun game to play with your friends if everyone chills out. Smash Ultimate feels like a step forward in some ways, and a step back in other ways. At launch, Smash Ultimate felt too focused on the competitive players. After patch 1.2, Nintendo has made some adjustments for the casual crowd and earned a star. The jury is still out as to if Smash Ultimate is more about fun or more about competition. I need to see some of the cons addressed before I increase the star rating for this product again.

Why are there 2 spirits? Are there other special moves not listed on those 5 moves? Where can I find them? I use game suggested spirits because there is no darn manual to explain! Why can my damage go above 100%? How do I do a “final smash?” What the heck is a “final smash?” Why does Kirby change after eating an opponent? How do I revert back? What is the buff he gets?

Not only is it really fun to play with the addition of a progression system with the spirits, skill tree, and unlocking more fighters, but it also quite long and will take you many hours to fully play through. I actually quite enjoyed the spirit system and the many different spirit fights seem diverse enough that it doesn't really start to bore me. Maybe the only problem is the varied difficulty of fights. Most fights are insanely easy after you have a decent full leveled spirit, even on the highest difficulty, but you can always purposefully handicap yourself by using a weaker spirit if that's your thing.  But also some of the fights were so insanely difficult and unfair that switching down to ""easy"" mode still made the fight take me 30 minutes of replaying to beat (and I'm pretty decent at the game).  Honestly it wasn't even a downside for me I enjoyed the challenge and it wasn't a necessary fight for progressing.Huge character pool this time around. ""Everyone is here!"" Not an exaggeration over 80 characters will be on the roster after dlc and counting Pokemon trainer as multiple fighters.  Obviously some of those are just slightly different echo fighters, but the diversity is still great.  Just quick unlocking characters by restarting, unlocking, and restarting again took a long time. All the characters look great and feel great to play and play vs, though I haven't  been able to use all of the extensively yet.I'm not a pro player by any stretch, but the fighting mechanics feel fluid and the engine seems well polished.  I love that the heavy characters have been buffed by having their lag time for aerials and landing reduced. I like them making perfect shield harder/different as it will give pros something to develop skill wise as well. Hopefully the pro scene will be able to make something of this game as smash 4 was a bit of a let down (won't even talk about brawl).They also made training mode better, and allow you to play the game while waiting for an online match, but many other parts of online are less than desirable.Cons:Online mode is kind of taking a back seat here. I was really hoping we would be getting a more fine tuned and more competition oriented online mode, but got the opposite. They made online mode a for fun system, which I understand is the direction Sakurai wants to take with the game, but I just don't understand why they couldn't have given their competitive community a bone here. Online match making no longer has a For Glory mode. There is simply casual mode with a matchmaking system that puts you up against someone near your skill level based on an elo system on a per fighter basis. It also matches you with some with a game rule similar to your own, but not exact.... this has made me go into what I thought was a 1v1 no items match into an assist trophy free for all nightmare.  This is also going to continue to create debates as to what the ""official"" competitive rule set  will be for  1v1 online play.Overall the game is a great experience and was definitely worth the purchase and worth the wait.

People just troll or kill themselves over and over when they die once and it apparently bans you for 30 minutes when you do that. When that happens I'm mostly like ""yay I get to stop playing.""

This is easily the only reason I bought a Nintendo Switch initially (I recently received a few Switch games for Christmas as well).The game is incredibly fun.  The Adventure mode takes you around a huge map where you collect 'spirits' that aid you in battle while you unlock your main fighting characters who have been trapped by evil.  When you think the Adventure Mode over and you beat the game - guess again.  You'll see what I'm talking about!I ended up beating it and finishing at 99.02% completion.  I played it on 'normal' difficulty.  If its too easy or hard, you can switch difficulty as well.  For the entire Adventure board and 99.02% completion, it took me just under 30 hours of game play.  You will definitely get your money's worth.There's also a 'spirit' mode where you just conduct battles to gather spirits.  They cycle out every 5 minutes or so.  It's great to collect any spirits you've missed as last I checked, there's over 1,200 in the game and there's been updates to continually add more.Smash Online is fun to battle in multiplayer.  There's different settings you can do from lives, items, maps, etc. that you can set so you're placed in a game that you want to be in.  My biggest complaint with online play though is that the servers are extremely laggy.  If one person in the match has a bad connection / slow internet / etc, then everyone suffers with lag and stuttering.  I am not sure if this is a Nintendo server issue or a Brawl server issue, but its pretty frustrating.  Other than that and if you're placed in a good server and people with good connections, its a load of fun and challenging if you're paired with other experienced Smash players.Overall, a great game.

There have been stepbacks, especially with Brawl, but each iteration brings something new and unique to the playing field. Smash Ultimate is more than that as it brings most of everything from all Smash games and THEN some.Technically, this game is gorgeous to play on a big screen and portable mode and 99.9% of the time, runs at a stable 60fps. Lag inputs are somewhat of an issue compared to older titles, but it's something I've gotten used to (still hoping for a patch).Speaking of input, the mechanics of this title are fluid and tight with each character feeling unique in their own movesets. There are so many characters to choose from and the promise of even more is mindblowing. It's almost impossible to buy this game, play it, and not find a character you stick to.But the real star of this show are the gamemodes, specifically the Adventure mode. World of Light has some great battles and good challenges for those looking for one, but it's extremely lengthy. My 100% playthrough of the adventure mode on hard clocked in at over 40 hours. Of course, your mileage may vary, but expect a long time grinding. Other modes, like classic and multi-man smash are also great fun, with challenges encouraging you to pull off some crazy, insane feats.But, when it comes down to just playing Smash by yourself or friends, this is the ULTIMATE package.

I hope you have fond memories of playing online games via Dial-Up. Just kidding, it's worse. Let me explain why...First, the online performance sucks. You'll lag. You'll cry. You'll keep playing and wonder why.Second, if you want it to suck just a little bit less--and I do mean just a LITTLE bit less--you have to buy an ADDITIONAL piece of equipment (USB-to-Ethernet adapter). Even then, it still sucks. You'll Google why it still sucks and be told by internet strangers that it's still somehow your fault. Ok. They don't have a problem. It's only you. You should stop using WiFi. You should get better internet. You should move to Japan.Third, you have to pay for online. That's right. You have to PAY someone MONEY in order to GET the worst online experience in your life. Scratch that; the worst online experience in your LIFETIME.

Was very disappointed after beating the World of Light to find there was nothing else to do but fight in every other game mode. Also the World of Light has steep variances in difficulty. I had to switch to easy to beat certain spirits, but switch to medium or hard to get a decent challenge out of the unlockable fighters and boss battles.Pros- Large array of characters.- Long story mode that requires you to think a littleCons- All game modes revolve around fighting- No cool minigames- World of Light has steep variances in difficulties due to spirit abilities/conditions- No ability to lower difficulty in Spirit Board.

I did however get a switch and after waiting for initial reviews decided it was time to have Smash on my switch.What can I say? I love this game. As an occasional gamer, I get a lot of value out of this game. I personally focus on classic mode and unlock a lot of elements of the game through the classic matches (new characters, music, etc (it has a story mode as well which is fine but not my focus). As of 2019, you can use the gamecube controller for this game with an adapter (which I have yet to try but expect it to be fantastic).Some reviewers who are new to smash have been turned off by initial impressions of the game. This is not a game to show off/play with friends the first night you open and play it. You have to play it and unlock its full potential. You will grow and develop into a better player doing so. If you want a fighting game for parties/gatherings and don't have the patience to unlock this game, consider something like capcom vs. or street fighter II.Additionally, you need to make sure you have a tv or monitor that has gamemode. If you have a bunch of settings on your display to make things look better, this will create input lag. I also recommend the pro controller for this game.All-in-all this is a fantastic version of Smash. It has replaced my need of Smash Bros.

I haven't played it for very long and even then only the single player ""story mode"", no local or network multiplayer.I don't usually get into fighting games but I decided to give this a try (there was that brief phase with ""killer instinct"" in 90s but lets not count that).What I eventually realized is that this is to the street fighter or soul caliber games what mario kart is the forza series: technically the same genre but serving a much different purpose.

I'm pretty sure the combinations of the other three button also do things. I also have no idea how to recover from falling off the edge of a stage.Actually there's one stage where this giant...I guess battle ship is aiming a massive gun at me the whole time and will decided the fire randomly. There was match it lasted about 5 seconds and I was already dead having not had time to do anything. It's a short loading time to retry but do it enough time even that load time gets annoying.I knew going in the pacing is fast and furious and probably confusing with so many characters on screen at once. I can't exactly mark it down for that. And wow, it is hyper fast and jumbled up when it's at its peak.For now I'm giving it four stars for lack of clarity and some truly confusing and arbitrarily hard stages.

If you want to have a friendly competition with your buds, SSBU just isn't suited for it. If you want to climb the Online ladder, SSBU just isn't suited for it.

(Although the game is pretty balanced for the top 10 players in the world, no one reading this review is top 10, and that's what matters.)There are MANY reasons for this, but they all come down to balancing. For two players of about equal skill, some matchups are just unwinnable because one character is so much better than the other. The game also has so much cheese; some characters are seemingly unbeatable by spamming one or two moves.I'm not going to list out ever issue I've encountered, but trust me when I say that you cannot take this game seriously as it is currently balanced. Nintendo has made several mistakes when deciding which fighters get what moves/abilities, and the quality of the gameplay greatly suffers for it.Side note: the Online has way too much input lag to be playable on normal home Wi-Fi. 0/10, do NOT recommend.",Poor balancing ruins the game.

Not sure if there’s any method to how you unlock certain characters, but they’re coming along at such a steady pace that I should get to my favorites without a hassle. The level selection menu is a little overwhelming so I tend to just stick it on random. The Adventure mode map is HUGE and will likely keep me busy for many hours to come.

I'm happy to report that this Smash has a really engaging solo-player aspect, mainly in the form of the World of Light campaign and spirit board challenges.While not as good as Brawl's Subspace Emissary in terms of story, it definitely has more interesting content and just lots of content in general. I was bummed when the previous gen of Smash didn't have as robust of a single player experience and non of it had any kind of story, but the World of Light has both.I also like the classic modes, which is like the original Smash's single player where you fight a series of configured battle based on which character you choose. This one adds more fun to it by basing the fighting conditions throughout each battle on the character as well. For example, Kirby's love of food is reflected through his classic mode by having healing food items available at the start of each battle. This makes each classic mode extremely unique from one another, so you don't get bored redundantly playing similar matches throughout. And it's especially fun if you're familiar with the characters and see the tweaks based around their characters.So in short, I recommend this game, especially if you're looking for a fun single player experience instead of just a multi-player/online match only game.",Great fun for both single player and multi-player,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,10,10,Public,7776910.0

This Smash iteration is the most polished out of them all. The game just works. For comparison, Melee had too many glitches which is what made it competitive, Brawl had too little hit stun and was too slow to do any combos at all and Meta Knight was just ridiculous, Smash For 3ds/Wii U had some combos but it really rewarded defensive play but you’ll find a compromise with all of that in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. If you want to play a party game this is it for you and also if you like to play competitively this is also for you. At first it was very weird getting into the game because of the new engine but when you get used to it. You’ll be able to zoom all over the place and just land hits reliably although not too recklessly. The only issue I have with this game so far is there’s a slight hint of delay with the joy cons. I have my TV set to game mode which the game recommends and also there’s a lot of buffer. What I mean by buffer is let’s say you press A to attack, and then you input a jump on accident after the attack. The game will still register what you input first so instead of doing any other action you jump instead. It got in the way of continuing my combos but I don’t think it’s too much of a problem.

One could even say it's the ""Ultimate"" version of the game. It can be played for hours with friends and I've even enjoyed playing on my own, though that isn't quite as fun as playing with a group of friends and family.I will admit it can be a confusing game to jump right in to if you've never played a Smash Bros game before. However, it can be enjoyed by little kids and adults alike. Make sure to watch the ""How to Play"" video after the intro to the game to get a basic idea of how the game works. These games have a pretty unique take on the fighting game genre, so I'll leave a basic summary below.The goal is to knock your opponents off the edge of the screen to reduce their lives. As you hit your opponent their percentage goes up. The higher that percentage is, the farther they will fly away when attacked. When a character is knocked out, they come back at 0% and continue battling until time runs out or they run out of stock/lives.Each character (there are 74!) has different kinds of moves, strengths, and weaknesses. There are multiple items, modes, and stages/levels in the game. The best way to learn it all is just to play. You'll quickly find characters you enjoy playing as and develop a fighting style that's all your own.I realize I haven't said much about the game yet, but there is so much going for it that it's hard to pick things out. The music, sheer number of stages and characters, and overall polish to the game is astounding. In terms of changes between previous versions of the game, some of my favorite things are:1) The physics of the game are the best so far. Its crisp, fast paced, and not as floaty as Brawl. Knocking people away, trying to get back to the stage, and performing combos just feels so fluid.2) Setting custom rulesets. I have my default 3 stock no items for 1 on 1 or true skill matches. I have a 3 stock all items high and smash meter on for the free for all party play. You can set the rules up whatever way you like and set a preset which makes getting in to play that much faster.3) Starting with the original 8 characters and unlocking all the new ones is actually really fun for me and never felt like a chore. Anyone complaining about this part must not remember what it was like to get Mewtwo (20 hours of vs matches) or Game and Watch (1000 vs matches) in Melee or Wolf in Brawl (450 matches). In this mode you get the chance to beat and unlock a challenger every 10 minutes of VS play, or even quicker if you reset the switch after every match. You also face a challenger every time you finish classic mode, or throughout the new Spirits mode in World of Light. It really is fun to watch the roster grow, and doesn't really feel all that grindy unless you are in a huge rush to unlock every one. If there is a character you really want, look up the charts that show you who unlocks who in Classic mode and you can have the character you want within 30 minutes easy.4) Slow-mo on knockout hits, extra damage in 1v1, the overlaid out of bounds box when someone went flying, and the smoke trailing characters matching their color are all huge quality of life improvements.5) Everything? I could go on and on. I love this game. Within a night of playing it was without a doubt my favorite game of the series.","Amazing Game, Best Smash Bros Yet!",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,,276,15,Public,1425329.0

There's plenty of improvements/changes over the last Smash with everything you love about this game series: all your favorite characters and stages, single player content that is enjoyable in small doses, and it will still be your go-to game for local multiplayer.As others have already ranted plenty about, the real killer of this game is the online. The ""preferred rules"" concept is terrible. You frequently can't play the type of stages you want, you can't change characters between battles, etc. etc., but I expect that to improve over time (it already did in the first patch). The real problem with the online... is you.I'm not a ""pro"" that participates in tournaments and argues with other ""pros"" on reddit; I primarily play to have a good time and enjoy 1vs1 Smash 4 ""for glory"" style battles the most. However, with the introduction of the GSP ranking system, the online community has been reduced to a slop fest of trolls who will do anything they can to win a match.You're happy that your favorite character Snake is back? When you meet him online, expect to be placed on a BF map with 3 stock and 7 on the clock then be zoned with grenades and other projectiles in an unrefined manner until the clock runs out. I'm completely fine with using projectiles; I'm not some elitist who thinks touching the B button for anything other than recovering makes you a noob, but there's a difference between using them effectively and using them to annoy your opponent to death.No more taunting? Not to worry. Everybody will make sure to skip around throughout the battle and/or frantically run back and forth between kills to assure you that they are superior. I'm not sure if they actually think they're fooling you while you respawn or they are just trying to piss you off, but you didn't see this kind of behavior in Smash 4 nearly as often.  A personal favorite of mine are the players who repeatedly do their best hit box dance while waiting for you to attack, resulting in a painfully long and boring match. And that's just it; the online battles are BORING.Hopefully these people will lose interest after they fill up enough tiles in their Elite screen and go back to Fortnite. I'm certainly getting tired of playing already, ending my morning Smash & coffee sessions questioning myself as to why I'm still playing this game. Maybe I'll go back to Splatoon 2 for a while and wait for the Smash community to improve.If you're reading this and happen to be one of these players, I hope a dragon with the face of your grandfather and giant ram horns crashes through your roof and psychically forces you to eternally relive the traumatic event(s) from your childhood that caused you to become this type of player.

It’s so good that I bought several copies for my other friends who couldn’t afford to get it on launch day due to being broke from Cyber Monday shopping. It does really bring backs nostalgic feeling once again with the Smash games combine into one(technically). Here is my own opinion/review on the game.Pros:The Gameplay aspect of the game is still basically the same with added mechanics that make it more fluid especially to some of the characters who were given upgrades to make them more enjoyable to use and the new additions to the series is like Sakurai said on several Nintendo Directs and it is mostly based on their moves from their respective series.The Modes is what you expect from the Directs especially the adventure(World Of Light) mode. I won’t put any spoilers into this review but I can say that it is an ending for the series that give the fans for Hardcore and Casual gamers to be happy about.Music/etc: The Music section aspect of it is for those who really enjoyed their favorite music list and function of listening it on the go is nice extra function. Recommended for those who enjoy listening to their favorite series music. Especially the opening of the game(Lifelight) and that is what you called a Fantastic opening for a game.Cons:Each character has a certain learning curve to master-or to the basics type of move set.Online: Some issues with the online service, could see them already releasing a patch soon later in the month to solve most of the issue. Watch for lags and slow frame rate when playing online. Also paying $20 for online sevice(it's not that much like PS+ and Xbox Live).Well thats it for my review of the game and I will enjoy it for a long time for the years ahead and it is a must for Nintendo Switch users to have this in their collection of Switch games. I will wait on buying the Season Pass until they show the second challenger pack next year.

A downside is the small amount of new stages. For single player content we have world of light which can give people dozens of hours of fun and classic mode which is the best it's ever been. For multilayer there are welcome new additions like stage morph and the FS meter which makes it more accessible to new customers. And this is a huge video game crossover with so many iconic video game characters and franchises represented here. The music libary is the best smash has ever had with easier ways to your favorites and a huge pool of classic and modern video game tunes. Graphically this game looks much better than smash for Wii u. A consequence of that is that it is easier to lose track of your character. More things that were disappointing is the race to the finish in classic mode and missing several classic modes like break the targets and home run contest. World of light can also be repetitious at times. But overall this is the best smash bros. game with the most content and is the easiest for newcomers to get into. I'm sure the competitive scene will be looked into maybe even more than smash 4 maybe even bigger since this is faster than that game.

The new ""system"" has features that pros can appreciate but won't distract or discourage new players. Overall, it is coming off as the best Smash game.Now here is my ONLY let down: World of Light feels grindy, boring, and I would REALLY much rather have sub space emissary from brawl, or adventure mode from Melee, or; better yet, more bosses for Classic mode would make this game AMAZING. I understand that they wanted to do something new and the symbolism, as well as the end of the game, are great. I am just not a fan of running into battle after battle equipping spirits for each and every encounter (same or less power level spirits give better rewards, so I was trying that). Others like me have eventually just choose one team and use them for the rest of the game instead of adjusting the spirit team.Yes it is close to amazing, but what I am saying is that World of Light could have been done better.",Is it Ultimate?,Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,2,7,Public,15710540.0

As a beginner who has spent countless hours trying to get good at this game, online play is NOT built for beginners. Two critical flaws that need to be addressed:1) Matching based on rank - every player starts at a high rank and lowers if you lose. I've played at 2.5M rank (hard) and 20K rank (easy) and do not notice any difference in opponents abilities. I play people online and there is a clear distinction between beginner, intermediate, and expert players which is not reflected here.2) Custom preferences - You can select things like 2 players, no items, certain stages, etc. I find that battles reflect my preferences, at most, 5% of the time. Virtually every match is 4 players, often with items. I don't even know what the point of this feature is because it doesn't do anything.This game has a long way to go, but it will be great if they focus on the right features.","Online play is garbage, single player okay",Platform: Nintendo SwitchEdition: StandardVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,3,2,Public,50730482.0

You can take control of characters from many of Nintendo's iconic game franchises, such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Metroid, Donkey Kong Country, Animal Crossing, and more, with some guests from Sega, Capcom, Square Enix, Konami, and even Namco's Pac-Man. This game is designed so you mostly play against each other, but there's nothing wrong with pairing up and facing computer opponents or real people over the internet in team battles. You already have enough controllers for two because of the two Joycons that come with the Nintendo Switch, but for a more comfortable option, there's a full pair of Joycons, the Switch Pro Controller, and the Nintendo Gamecube Controller, but you need the Gamecube Controller Adapter to use those. A Must Have for the system, whether for children or adults.For Non-Casuals: Fantastic. This game feels incredible. There's a certain swiftness and power in this game that I didn't feel in Smash 4. First of all. Look at the UI. It is streamlined and kind of gives off that competitive feel. Characters KO faster and most, if not all characters that I know of , have kill-confirms, so you have a certified option to defeat your opponent. Online is on the weak side. For me, an ethernet adapter made a difference, but if your opponent has a bad connection, you will. Hopefully, Nintendo will improve the game's netcode. Just get it.
