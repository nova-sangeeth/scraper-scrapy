Out of the box they look nice and quality made. Lightweight, fairly sturdy, probably comfortable. UA is a respectable brand and these look about like what you would expect from this brand in this price range. However, my usual size (I have worn 12's for decades) does not fit properly. Too short and I think too narrow in the toe area as well. I can't tell for sure because once scrunched in there it is too uncomfortable to discern specifics. Not off by a lot, but more than enough to be uncomfortable. I wore them around the house a bit to see if they might have some give to them, but there seems no way they will ever stretch or break in comfortably. My first thought about the heel fit was, “A blister waiting to happen.” I have since read several reviews mentioning the unyielding backs of the shoe causing problems. So maybe this would be an issue even without the too short fit. Combined with the toe squeeze feature it makes for a pair of shoes I would not want to walk far in. I’m going to go a different way for my next attempt.

The insole is crap and is clued in with the intent to have it stay.  This is not a good idea.  The insole that comes with the shoe is just a cloth covered flat foam that offers no support.  If you have high arches, planter fasciitis, or other foot condition requiring specialized support this shoe is not for you.  If you pull out the insole before wearing it to put in an insole product you trust, you might be okay. Emphasis on ""might"" because they put a lot of clue on the insole the provide.  If you wear the shoe to try it out first, like I did, the pressure from your foot will fuse the insole to the shoe's foundation.  From there I had to slowly tear out the insole in pieces, being careful not to disturb the surface of the sole's foundation; rather labor intensive.  I replaced the worthless insole with the Easyfeet insole that I removed from my old shoe and now I am happy.  However, I will not be purchasing this shoe again because going through all that is just too much inconvenience.  It is too bad as everything else about the shoe is great.Addendum May 20, 2021:  I wear this shoe primarily for walking and running on my treadmill 5 to 6 days a week.  I have had the shoes for 5 months now and the right shoe has worn out in the heal, which caused a nasty blister on my foot. This is not the way my shoes usually wear out and hasn't happened in many years; this is my first Under Armour shoe. From the pictures I have included you can tell that the shoe has not been abused. The sole does not show much wear, which is what you would expect for 5 months. The heal on the inside is a mess however, as is the blister on my foot. Needless to say, it is clear that this is not a great shoe and I would not recommend it to anyone. including someone I didn't like.

I'm in shock that the reviews are as good as they are. If you're like me and think that the universal praise for this shoe along with an unbeatable price point is just too good to be true, just know that it is.I bought these shoes in early February of this year. I am an active person who puts their footwear through a decent amount of abuse, but this brand and model are marketed as being able to handle that. When I got the shoes, I was pleased with how the shoe looked and felt. For what it is worth, these are good looking shoes for an incognito life. I didn't have any problems getting in to the shoe, and I wanted to take them out right away. When I stood up and took my first steps, the shoes immediately dug into the back of my heel, a feeling I would become very familiar with in the coming months. The shoes fit me properly, I had the right size. I figured I just had to break them in for a week or two and then I'd be sitting pretty in my new shoes.This ""break in"" period lasted months. I've been wearing these shoes everyday since February until August and except for a week in late April where they mysteriously felt comfortable, these shoes have consistently made my ankles bleed. I have scars from refusing to give up on these shoes. I tried doubling or even tripling up on tube socks, I tried manually pressing the heel back for hours to try and make it less sharp. My socks are glorified blood napkins because of these shoes. My friends suggested I ditch them entirely or invest in some protective socks but I was not going to do that because of my pride. Because of that pride I will have scars on my ankles for life. I've become less active because I don't want to put these shoes on and therefore less happy. I even delegated them to being work shoes but at the end of the day I hate these shoes. I will never skimp on footwear ever again.

One of the best pairs of shoes I ever owned. The only flaw was the sole didn't have a heck of a lot of tread and I started having grip issues when working out or biking after about a year of regular use. Whereas I couldn't find the same shoe again in my size and a colorway I liked, I shifted over to this model. It's a fine shoe, but not quite as good as the Remix FW18. Decent padding, but doesn't quite feel like it forms to my foot like the Remix FW18 did. Also feels a little larger on the whole than the Remix FW18. This might be my own fault, though, as I'm using the pull strap on the back to put the Charged Assert on, which probably means I'm pushing my foot further forward. It also feels a shade heavier than the Remix FW18 did at first and is a little uncomfortable toward my upper-middle foot, though I have very flat feet, which means I might just need insoles. I feel like the shoe will do fine, and the price was right, but I feel like I took a half a step down from the Remix FW18. Still more comfortable than a lot of other athletic shoes I've worn, though. I've had good luck with Reebok, so-so luck with Nike and bad luck with adidas.

I’ve had them about a month now and they are extremely comfortable and are built very well. I hope in the near future they still have this for this price or even better at a lower price would be awesome. I have a wide foot and I can fit in most shoes no problem but when I seen they had a 13w I was so stoked so I ordered they came in a week wish it was two day prime but they still got here and they are true to what they offer for size.
