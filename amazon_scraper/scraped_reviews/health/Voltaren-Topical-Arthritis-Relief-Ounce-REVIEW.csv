I have osteo arthritis and found it worked on pain places other than my feet as well - hands, shoulders, leg cramps, knees and more.  I only found out two days ago that I didn't need to get a prescription for it any longer when I saw a commercial on tv.  If you didn't have insurance or hadn't met your co-pay it could cost up to $80 per tube.  This stuff works - not for everything but it helps keep me going at 72 - I use it before working out, before yoga, before Pilates.  It is odor free, doesn't stain clothes, is absorbed very quickly and my doctor said I could use it up to 4 times a day.  It eliminates the need to take Ibuprofen or Alleve by mouth which I found upset my stomach.  It is really terrific at dealing with many kinds of pain.  I live in a state with legal medical marijuana and found those lotions didn't work as well as the Voltaren Gel on my aches and pains.

I'm very used to physical pain daily. I don't remember what it felt like to NOT hurt. It's mainly my lower back, sciatica, spine down through legs. Gabapentin is my miracle medicine for extreme restless leg syndrome. I was on strong pain meds for about 14 years...over 120-140 a month, and it still hurt not to mention my body was addicted to the medication. I wasn't an addict, like we all think of, but the pain was more intense if I tried to stop. After a pain management took me through a month of morphine, which im obviously allergic to, because had horrible headaches and threw up. I took it back to be counted and flushed. Oxycodone or oxycontin...I don't remember, did nothing. Then he wanted me on methadone!!! Ive always believed that is what addicts are given to get off heroin and such. I walked out and haven't been back. February will be 3 years of no pain meds. Damn right it was rough. I knew it was what I had to do, though, because meds were getting stronger, and I still hurt terribly. I even had the nerve injections in my lower back. The first one was wonderful,  the next 2 were a waste of money. I decided I'd try to just bow up and walk it off with hot Epsom salt soaks, icy hot, icy hot with lidocaine (which a doc discovered I couldn't take) I tried otc patches, every spray, every cream. THEN, my husband's best friend told me about VOLTAREN!!! OMG!!! If only I'd had this years ago!! Obviously  I was skeptical. But, I went to CVS about 8:30 one night because I was just hurt too bad. I put about a nickle/quarter size squirter in my hand....rubbed my lower back, and within 20-30 minutes, I realized,  omgoodness!!! I'm not in that pain anymore!! I could not believe it!! I hit Amazon and ordered 4 more large tubes!! I will never be without this amazing cream. THANK YOU for helping me function better and enjoy a better quality of life with my family. It absolutely still blows my mind how well it works!! My daughter tried it and was like 😳 exactly!! We are fans for life! Sorry this is so long, but I felt it was important to explain how extreme my pain has been close to 2 decades and trying every prescribed medication, otc meds, patches, sprays, injections, and creams. Next step was going to be to the new medical Marijuana clinic. Now, I'm happy with VOLTAREN 😀 thanks for listening!

The is a topical prep of a oral drug (also called Voltaren but there other names and strengths made by different companies) that has been around since 1988. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (more commonly called a NSAID by the docs - similar to Ibuprofen and Naproxen). The topical gel was approved around 2009. It was never used much probably because you have to apply it qid (short for 4 times day.). It still has  - in theory anyway - all the short comings of this class of meds - GI problems, possible heart problems, etc.Most docs will tell you that you can use with acetaminophen and other NSAID's  depending on your other health issues.It is used for the knees/ankles primary but is also fairly effective for the shoulder. It doesn't work very well for hip pain as that seems to be set too far from the skin's surface to get any meaningful amount in the joint. The oral version works well for hip pain depending on the cause. IF the back pain is due to osteoarthritis it might help  - at least some. I was very skeptical when the Gel was first approved but for certain types of pain - like osteoarthritis - but it is almost like magic (at least for some people).I've also tried the CBD  and shungite topicals which did help me some.This is - in my profession opinion - the only typical product that really works for most patients. However - it is messy and you do have to put it 4 times a day. IF It's your knee you can't put you pants back on for at LEAST 5 minutes after a application. IF you do put you pants back on the will stick to your legs, etc.Lastly, if you do try it make sure you family doc is aware of it - probably a good idea to tell you pharmacist too to avoid any drug interactions.i would rate this product 8.75 to 9.25 out of 10 - well worth giving it shot!!",A pharmacist's opinion,Flavor Name: UnflavouredSize: 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 2),87 people found this helpful,"1,810",773,Public,20858

I’ve had osteoarthritis for more than half my be life, & have been taking pain pills for over 25 years, but nothing ever took the pain away.For years my doctor talked about a “arthritis ointment” to help with pain relief, but was only available in Canada.

I get far better pain relief for my arthritic knees on a recumbent or outdoor road bike. So I'm done with this product for good.The next paragraph is my first update after a few weeks and was my initial ""I hope it works"" review. Voltaren gel doesn't work for me. It’s also a chore to apply this stuff - I don’t miss that part at all.I wound up getting a cortisone shot in my arthritic left knee and it worked great. So be advised that Voltaren gel will likely only work on very minimal arthritis pain that I can ignore anyway. I could NOT ignore the pre-cortisone shot pain, it was nasty.Initial review - I've been applying this gel as directed using the dosage strip 4 times a day on my knees, especially my left knee  which hurt like hell from 45+ years of weight lifting, ice hockey goaltending, football, track and cross country (It's mostly ice hockey). My left knee wakes me up every night (after the cortisone shot, that night time knee pain totally vanished)After 8 days of solid use, this gel has yet to really ""work"". it's annoying to apply unless you live in LA where you have shorts on 24/7. It sort of stinks, like DEET mosquito repellent and some lame fragrance. It takes about 10 minutes to absorb into the skin so I'm walking around the house sans pants 4x a day for 15 minutes. It's not a good look. I hope it works because I think the UPS guy is about to call the cops because I have my pants off all the time.I saw another reviewer freak out about the package side effect list. I worked in the pharma biz for40+ years in pharmacy and biotech and those adverse events are FDA required but can be minuscule in reality - like 0.01% occurrence.

Capsaicin cream helped some, but my wife is allergic to the pepper dust as it flecks off after it dries so I didn’t continue using it. I tried Hemp cream and CBD cream and it may have helped some. My doctor suggested that I try diclofenac gel, and that pain reliever seemed to work pretty well, better than the others.But that doesn’t mean that Diclofenac gel is a solution for everyone. Following the directions for using it is a pain. They call for measuring a 4.5” bead of gel on your knee or ankle 4 times a day. You squeeze out the 4.5” dose and rub it into your skin. It doesn’t spread smoothly or dry quickly, so after you rub it in you need to wait while it dries. For me, that meant sitting with my knees exposed for about 15 minutes. If I put pants on sooner it would be rubbed off, so all winter I had to sit around with my pants off while waiting for the gel to dry. Maybe it would be some easier wearing a skirt, but for someone at work or in an office you would have to figure out how to manage the mid-day application.Only 6% of the diclofenac sodium NSAID gets through the skin and into your bloodstream, so if you want a full dose it is probably best to clean the leftover gel off before making a new application. The residue doesn’t wash off easily and I never bothered. Instead the dried gel flaked off like dandruff if I went to bed without showering.Over the months I used diclofenac gel from five different sources. I used Voltaren, and Walgreens and CVS house formulations of the gel, and I used prescription tubes and a generic tube from Amazon. I haven’t discovered that the source affected its ease of application or its effectiveness, but there are differences.The cost difference is important. Voltaren from Amazon costs about $4.83 an ounce, or 17¢ a gram. One 4.5” bead weighs about 2.4 grams, so an application of Voltaren to each knee four times a day costs about $1.36. You might want to find a cheaper formulation. The house brands from Walgreens and CVS are somewhat cheaper and the generic from Amazon is $3.16 an ounce right now. The prescription med is expensive at full price, but with my drug insurance it costs only about $1.71 an ounce, so you might consider getting a prescription.There are other considerations in choosing. All the alternatives I used come in a metal tube that can be squeezed very flat so no gel is wasted. Voltaren comes in a plastic tube that retains its rounded shape, so I couldn’t be sure that I was getting the full last dose. See the photo for a comparison. Voltaren has a small aperture which, for me, produced a fine even diclofenac bead which was easier to apply but also reduced the size of the dose somewhat.The bottom line is that you need to decide whether you want to deal with diclophenac, and if so if Voltaren the source you want to use.",Voltaren is not an automatic choice,Flavor Name: UnflavouredSize: 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 2)Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,4,8,Public,5219037

It got to the point where I would have severe attacks and swelling in my feet making it impossible to stand or walk. On a pain level scale of 1-10, about 50% of the days were spent in the 8-10 range while the remainder were at least 5s. After seeing a specialist, I was given special shoe inserts to help alleviate the flare ups. While these helped somewhat in reducing the level of pain, I was still experiencing daily pain in the 5-6 range with a minimum of 3. After seeing an Ad for Voltaren, I decided to give it a shot. It has been a lifesaver and a complete game changer for me! My pain level is pretty consistent at 1-2 now and, after 3 months of use, I have not had anything over a 4.
