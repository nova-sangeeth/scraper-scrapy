The item was fine and looked great. We put it in our bathroom and both my husband and I weighed ourselves. Then just a few moments ago, my husband went to weigh our son and afterwards scooted the scale back against the wall. The corner of the scale lightly bumped the bottom of the toilet then shattered into a million pieces! We were so shocked! I understand that tempered glass shatters this way (we own cups made of tempered glass that have shattered this way when dropped on a hard floor), but I don't think this particular light bump warranted such an explosion of glass. We owned the scale for barely a couple hours and each only stepped on it once. The large number of positive reviews for this item made me believe it would be a good idea to buy a scale made out of glass, but obviously it was not.

That's the scale increment, and so this is certainly acceptable.You can calibrate the scale by tapping it with a foot while not being on it, but unlike our previous scale, you don't need to calibrate it each time you use it. This scale shows numbers instantly as you start to step on, and the numbers increase as you put your full weight on, and then it stabilizes at a final reading. It feels faster at getting a reading than our previous scale.I also like the fact that there are no needless features to run down batteries: it just weighs, and that's all. There are no buttons on the top, which should make cleaning easier than our previous scale which had useless (for us) buttons for keeping track of different users' weights.My only wish would that the corners were a bit more rounded.",Repeatable results,Color: SilverStyle: DigitalVerified Purchase,18 people found this helpful

I know weight can vary based on time of day, so I assumed it was just that, even though 3lbs seemed like a big difference.

If you line them up, this one will be 3.5 lbs higher some days, and 5 lbs higher on other days compared with the others for a given person.The scale does stick to its first answer for repeated weigh-ins, but seems to change its mind if you let it turn off and then turn it on again later even though it's allowed to zero each time before stepping on.Now, I don't expect a bathroom scale that costs under $30 to be accurate enough for buying and selling gold bars, but it's the inconsistency that bothers me.

I'm fairly small so even one pound extra for me is quite a lot (yeah yeah I know I shouldn't fret over one pound but I do, so :shrug:). I bought this scale because everyone in the comments said it was very accurate... and they weren't lying!The first thing I did is weigh myself to compare with the Aria. This scale gave me the same number every single time, while the Aria varied from 0.7 to 1 lb more than the Etekcity scale. I then weighed a pound of butter on the Etekcity and it gave me EXACTLY 1 lb. I couldn't do the same with the Aria as it won't weigh small amounts, but weighing myself WITH the pound of butter just gave me the same 0.7 to 1 lb more than the Etekcity every time. I guess the Aria is consistent in its inaccurate weight?Overall, I just trust the Etekcity more because you actually reset it every single time you weigh yourself. You have to apply pressure on then scale, step off, and then wait for it to go to zero, and THEN you weigh yourself. This means that it will always start from zero. With the Aria, you never know what you're gonna get.I'm very happy with my purchase and I regret wasting so much money on the Aria. Yeah, it uploads my weight to the cloud and gives me stats and stuff, but honestly I NEVER look at it and it hasn't really brought me any value.

I was disappointed as that throws off the accuracy, however, I emailed Etekcity and they’re sending me new pads. Mind you, it’s been 2 YEARS, and they’re standing behind it to send me pads. They responded to my emails so fast, even on the weekend.My favorite part of this scale is that you do not need to tap for it to hit 0.0 and then step on. You just get on and it does it’s thing.Those who have said they get a different reading in different spots, it’s more than likely due to uneven ground. Ive moved this scale all over my house and the only time the reading was wrong was when it was on uneven flooring(thanks old house!).I have stepped on the scale for a reading, then  stepped off and took my shirt off or pants and stepped on and sure enough, the ounces go down. I’ve done the same with stepping back on after putting clothes on and watched the reading go up with accuracy.This scale saw me through over half of my 130 pound weight loss! Many times I weighed myself and then went to the doctor the same day and had an identical reading there as well. That says a lot.Highly recommended scale.",Highly recommend.

It looks good with its tempered glass platform and nice sized backlit display. Weight readings are very accurate and displayed in tenths of a pound, so it has a resolution of 1.6 ounces.

Am a little disappointed in warranty after signing up as it states must keep original box of product quits working to return as I’m not holding onto a box for up to two years. I hope it doesn’t shatter like a few others in reviews cuz it seems very nice. I’ll update if anything negative happens otherwise, very pleased with product on arrival.Update a year later: this scale is still working very well, always says the same weight of you get on and off it again unlike other scales that can change. It shows you your weight quickly. This is great for impatient small children. We also use it for our small animals to check their weight while we hold them. No issues with breaking.

What do you like or dislike? What do you use this product for? To answer the first question I like it alot. This may seem weird but I only got it about an hour ago but it is an obvious quality product right from opening the box and seeing it for the first time. You can see that the tempered glass is thick and will hold up to the 400lb it says it's capable of weighing. It comes with batteries so you can start using it as soon as you open the box and place it on the floor. You'll have to pull out the tab to make the connection work but that's nothing to deal with. I like the display because it's big and I can see it well without any difficulty. It's larger than I expected. And it was a simple setup. You put it on the floor you put your foot on it real quick take your foot off it turns itself on and zeros out and you get on it and it weighs you. I got off of it and again made myself stepping on it and it came out to exactly the same number the second time so I believe that is at least accurate within itself. I think I answer the second question by telling you I'm going to be using it for my weight control. And speaking of weight control it also comes with a measurement tape also of excellent quality. I probably shouldn't mention that I have bought one other item from this company that I was so satisfied with their return and replacement policy. I bought these digital lanterns and one of them was defective which I wrote them about and they sent me another one without any questions. I had a question and asked him if I should send back the defective one and I said do not bother will just send you a new one to replace the defective one.

I’ve been able to weigh both my kitties, one just under 5lbs and the other right at 15lbs. The only negative is trying to weigh around 5lb mark usually only works for a few seconds and then disappears vs heavier objects will gather the weight, flash and then lock in the weight so you can see it before stepping off. It came with the batteries (!!!!!!) and a handy measuring tape that retracts almost like measuring tapes do so you can see how big or small certain areas are.

Weighing myself before and after drinking a large glass of water and it shows that I gained 0.6-0.8lb which is about right.  It doesn't seem to be sensitive to the position that I stand on the scale which my old one was susceptible to.
