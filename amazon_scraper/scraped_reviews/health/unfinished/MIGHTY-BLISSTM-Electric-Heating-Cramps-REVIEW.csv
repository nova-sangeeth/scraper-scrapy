I’ve tried chiropractic chairs and ergonomic desks…… Taken and followed advice from everyone and their grandmother…but to no avail! My neck and shoulder muscles just tense up leaving me with a THROBBING pain that begins directly behind my ears, pulses way down my neck and spreads right through my shoulders. The WORST part is the spasms that only intensify as I try to relax! I’m always stiff and achy long after I’ve left my office, just as I’m trying to unwind on my sofa and watch some TV!!And believe me when I say I have tried absolutely EVERYTHING!From creams to exercises to acupuncture to aquatic therapy to cortisone shots…….. Lately, I’ve been racking up bills at the chiropractor as that’s the only treatment that’s offered me some relief. He has also suggested that I use a heating pad between sessions and during flare-ups. I’ve found that to be helpful too.However, it’s taken me FOREVER to find the RIGHT heating pad! I’ve gone through several and found none of those small, cheaply made, scratchy clothed, poorly wired PIECES OF JUNK (at best…. And FIRST CLASS FIRE HAZARDS at worst…!) to actually work for more than a few weeks!After the last one annoyed the hell out of me with inconsistent heating (it had cold spots) and kept coming out of its itchy fabric envelope (poorly designed to pretend it’s an upgrade over the bare plastic ones…!) I went online to research the highest quality, chiropractic heating pad out there. (I’m actually embarrassed to mention just how much I thought I was going to have to spend!!!!)I must admit the real reason the Mighty Bliss heating pad caught my attention at first was the sharp turquoise color and that SOFT PLUSHY MATERIAL!!! And I figured it can only be an improvement to what I’ve already tried. I’ve tried them ALL!!! It was way cheaper than I bargained for, had excellent reviews, and boasted significantly larger dimensions than any heating pad I’ve ever owned.  Well, I sure was pleased! It turned out to be the largest, plushiest piece of turquoise HEAVEN I have ever experienced in a heating pad…. BEFORE EVEN TURNING IT ON!… And whadya know…??? Suddenly my wife needs it too!! She’s had back pain ever since she had a bad fall on a skiing trip, but she’s a “Pop-2-advils-and-carry-on” kinda girl...All of a sudden I’m sharing my heating pad…! She SWEARS she feels a HUGE difference!Being the electrical engineer I am and having seen 1 too many heating pads nearly start a fire I obviously (knee jerk reaction, I cannot help myself) unscrewed the controller and took a deeper look into the electrical workings of this pad and I must say I’m impressed with the quality and safety level of this heating pad.FIRST and foremost, its designed to shut down as soon as it detects too much electricity/ heat trapped or concentrated in one area (for example when putting too much weight or pressure directly on it.) This might make the product appear defective but in reality, this would prevent a fire, unlike most heating pads which aren’t designed to detect this kind of issue!And by the way, this pad features and ETL Certification, which if I had to explain without boring you to death pretty much means that a universally recognized Electronic Testing company called Intertek put this pad through HELL….and it held up perfectly!SECONDLY, the 2-hour shutoff feature is brilliant! I only realized the subconscious anxiety I had when using other heating pads (for fear of dozing off and forgetting to shut it before I fell asleep) when I started using THIS one and realizing that I could ALLOW MYSELF to fall asleep REST ASSURED that is would SHUT ITSELF OFF!! (and not stay on all night if I conked out on the sofa!)BEST OF ALL: This Mighty Bliss heating pad really has improved my neck and shoulder pain SIGNIFICANTLY, as I've been able to go much longer between chiropractor appointments!!!There’s just something about this heating pad that makes me truly relax and allow it to work its MAGIC on my stiff muscles!BOTTOM LINE: If you’re looking for that PERFECT heating pad and going in circles as I did, forget all the other JUNK out there and stick with MIGHTY BLISSThe features that have me sold on this: EXTRA LARGE PAD... long enough to cover my entire back... SOFT AND COZY... EXTRA LONG CORD – I can now use it in bed. I HATED the feeling of being leashed to my electrical outlets. 3 DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE SETTINGS (I love the hottest! my wife likes medium.) HEATS UP QUICKLY and EVENLY! ELECTRONICALLY SAFE AND SOUND with the brilliant 2 HOUR SHUTOFF!OK enough said....",The BEST heating pad in my TOO LONG record buying EVERY model EVER MANUFACTURED,Verified Purchase,"2,859 people found this helpful"

What sets this apart from others I have used?1. This heating pad has a thick soft layer which is absolutely wonderful, especially welcome when one has hurt a body part. You can wrap this around a shoulder, arm, foot, etc., and feel so pampered.2.  No problem with washing-- First I unplugged the cord, set it aside, and then washed the pad on gentle and then laid it flat to dry.3.  My cats and I are in love with these pads! We both enjoy the warmth--especially helpful for me with a torn biceps tendon and numerous permanent back issues.  The heat is quite effective at controlling pain, thank you!!!I would also like to thank the company for being incredibly responsive, kind, and generous in replacing a faulty electric controller. They responded to me more nicely than any company has ever helped me out, refunding my money, and then, unbelievably, sending me TWO new heating  pads! This was completely unanticipated generosity, for which I am extremely grateful. I can now put heat on my shoulder (recovering from extensive surgery) AND put heat on my back as we try to figure out how to reduce that nerve pain.  These heating pads have helped me tremendously with diminishing pain, thereby increasing my quality of life. No small feat.  Again, thank you.",Can a heating pad be one's best friend?

They are sometimes just a heat on -heat off control and usually get too hot. My mother and brother both had this version. I recently purchase this heating pad for my 86 year old mother and she absolutely loves it. It has temperature controls which give her the option of applying a mild heat or stronger depending on what she actually needs. Elderly people from what I learned have to be able to adjust the temperature because sometimes they lose feeling and can be burned by the device. The auto shut off feature helps this problem.  My mother loves it and uses it daily. She asked me to buy one for my brother and I was surprised he loved it as well. The fact that it is washable was questionable to me but I felt it had to be an upgrade from what she was using.Funny to hear people rave about a heating pad but it is true. My brother has already washed his due to a spill accident and he told me it is still working great after this happened.

After my recent hip dislocation and hamstring tear I needed to replace my previously adored, but broken, heat pad to wrap around my thigh and hip. Before you get excited, no, this doesn't fully wrap around my thigh (I'm 5'6"" at 180 lbs and wear pant sizes M-L or 12-14).First, this one isn't as soft and cushy as reviews lead me to believe. The fabric on one side is soft and equal to the velour side of a beach towel, the other side is a thin flannel-like material. It's not luxurious by any means.In fact, this is so thin and light weight it practically floats on you. For an area that is sensitive to even a sheet lying on it, this is a plus, but for those that like their heat pad to stay where you put it, you're going to have a hard time.This is the thinnest, lightest, and least soft of any heat pad I have ever used.Second, the large button on the controller (which is nice) is so touch sensitive that if I toss my blanket over it this will press the button and command it to go to the next setting. Just keep the blanket apart from the button you say? Well, the indicator light is bright enough to light a corner of a dark room so if you find that bothersome or understand what lights can do to your sleep cycle, then it's going to need to get along with my light blocking blanket.Third, and perhaps most important, the heat is inconsistent. When turning it on to its lowest setting it quickly gets so hot it could burn you but then takes its time to cool down until the scheduled run time (which feels too short) concludes.I do love the long cord, the large button (just wish it had more resistance), that this gets to be hotter than any other heat pad I've ever used, and it's a decent size (but I wish it were a bit bigger).Ultimately, it's just ok, mostly a pain to keep in place and to keep at the level it's set at, it'll burn you before it gets to a comfortable temperature just before it turns off. I need a heat pad right now so I'm keeping, with hopes of finding something better before the return period ends it but my search continues because this just isn't good enough.","Wouldn't Buy This Again - Inconsistent Heat, Feels Cheap",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

I really wish they'd go back to removable covers. The heat is uneven, like with some of the newer pads, you normally need the center to get full relief. With this pad, it's a small area, compared to it's larger size, and even if you use that exact spot on the area you need it, it's still not putting out enough heat to penetrate your muscles.

It's made to be unplugged there, so I didn't do anything weird that shouldn't have been touched or moved. Stinks because I really liked this heating pad. But if something as insignificant as unplugging the cord from the pad causes it to not work then it's just cheap crap. I'm guessing the fault is in the power switch on the cord. Not sure if that's a replaceable part or not and knowing how it was just unplugged, do I want to waste money on something that is so sensitive?This pad is large and flexible. The cover is soft so you don't have to fight with another cover for it. I got it to replace a rather old one. Only thing I'm not thrilled with is that it only stays on for about 2  hours, then you have to turn it on again.

It's important to know that 1 I bought this to replace a ""portable"" belt-like heating pad that I had for about 5 months until it died on me and wouldn't work even plugged into the wall,  so if you see a heating pad that meets that description here on Amazon (probably sold by a Chinese company) I recommend not purchasing that product.2 I have extremely painful menstrual cramps so I have a high tolerance for heat and ibuprofen these days which means my opinion on heat might be different from an average individual.Now, with the disclaimers aside, I really like this heating pad. It's comfy and soft and it's heat output is good. I gave the heat 4 stars only because I would say after about an hour of high heat, it feels like it lowers the heat significantly even with the light still indicating its on high heat. The auto shut down feature does work, I believe after 2 hours, but I could be wrong about the exact timing since I tend to reset it regularly for the high heat output. I, also, tend to use this heating pad as a heated blanket when I'm out on trips (I'm a flight attendant) and it helps get me to sleep quickly in hotel beds which is really nice. The cord is very long, another thing I like about it, so I don't have to feel so leashed if I want to use the heating pad.Those are the highlights I've experienced with the heating pad so far and while I know there's cheaper options, I can promise you that if it's from Target or that portable belt one I mentioned that they will die on you within a few months and you'll be back here again looking for a new heating pad.

It took far too long to realize better, affordable options exist, with the added bonus they don't feel like they'll scorch my skin or contribution to the annual house fire count in my province.Heating blankets get used around my residence more heavily in the winter months when the gnawing cold of a Canadian winter manages to affect even the kid. They're helpful for muscle pain and cramping. I began using mine frequently for neck and shoulder pain acquired by a terrible sleeping posture. We're not heavy users in my family but when we need them, we employ them regularly over a day or evening.Key features I looked for that Mighty Bliss met: temperature control (aforementioned people and house fires are not desirable), softness, and durability. A weakly warm heating blanket is called the cat. This heating blanket is large enough to conform to a generous portion of the anatomy (my back or abdomen, a very tall man's thigh, most of my elementary schooler), but it holds up a bit more robustly than the picture credits it for. It feels like a warm blanket that can keep its shape when you wrap it around a limb.Mighty Bliss is aptly named. After trawling through reviews in search of something meeting my needs, I was incredibly pleased to find this lives up to the hype. An easy button control allows you to cycle through three modes, and will be especially appreciated by elderly or arthritic fingers. The long cord puts the controls in reach without forcing you to sit 12 inches from the nearest socket. Overall the blanket isn't very heavy, making for easy adjustments in placement and no threat of smothering you. That said, it's not a true blanket; it won't flop around your shoulders like a comfortable weighted blanket, and you might have to work a little to get it to settle in place.The heat is obviously the star quality: it's warm without being too hot, toasty on the highest setting without threatening to incinerate you, the bed, or a chair. Direct contact on the skin never feels like it will burn. Neither does this have a very strong smell as some blankets do, but you'll know when it is on. It smells like a fuzzy warm towel or blanket. I've found the highest setting is my favourite, but if you only need mild radiating heat, go for medium or low. They apply a steady and comfortable glow that alleviates discomfort.Mighty Bliss is a solid product. This heating blanket holds up well through use without getting matted, flattened, or electrical components coming free. We're not the gentlest users -- little hands try to curl the blanket around a supervised little body -- and my spouse is a tall person. We've been absolutely thrilled by the overall use and quality, and I will absolutely consider this at the top of the list as a present, be it for Christmas, birthdays, après-ski gifts, or for someone recovering from illness or time in the hospital. If you're in the market, stop looking.Plus, it's made in the US with high quality goods.

I turn it and it goes to both shoulders . SECOND it is soooo soft.  I have bought tons of drug store pads and the little flimsy pad covers come off and you are laying on hard plastic. This is super comfortable. I use it every night. It has good heat and I just cant say enough good about it. Oh, and it is made in the USA and it is a home grown business!100% satisfaction!!",The absolute best!! Hands down!!,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

That type of outreach and personal touch is always nice to see in a company.I have used Sunbeams for years due to shoulder pain and foot pain from RSD. Heat packs help alleviate some of it so I tend to use them a lot and frequently. One thing about Sunbeams, is they always break within a couple of months and malfunction in the same way every time. I got sick of that, so decided to go with a different brand. So far, I'm not disappointed at all. It's a fantastic, big heating pack that provides the perfect amount of heat.

Unlike other heating pads which I have used in the past which feel like rigid, uncomfortable vinyl and cool into twisted, hardened shapes, the Mighty Bliss maintains its cozy, soft feel and original shape even when not in use.  The other heating pads had cloth covers which snapped over the vinyl pad, and this design was always problematic.  The cover was always slipping off, leaving the vinyl exposed to the skin.  The cover on the Mighty Bliss totally encases the heating pad, and according to directions, can be hand-or-machine washed by simply disconnecting the electrical cord.

Possibly the cord could be a bit longer but at ten feet in length it's not bad and is usually within reach of an outlet. Though it is in no way a deal breaker I'm not real fond of the heat control on this unit. Yes the button is large and functions smoothly. Which is not a bad thing for a senior with sore hands.

The controls rotate through Low, Med, High, and Off, and automatically shuts off after 2 hours. The pad itself is completely sewn shut, without direct access to inner heating component. It can be machine washed - I would recommend laying flat to dry for at least 24 hours before reconnecting. The care instructions are printed directly on the underside of the pad. We have not tested with moist heat, like placing a damp washcloth between the pad and the body. The low setting is very low, and the pad can be placed directly against the skin. The Med setting is probably closer to the Low setting than the High. The High setting gets reasonably warm, but is not as hot as our old one (that is a good thing!). I like the auto-shut off feature because we can take a nap without worry, and because the control rotates through the setting (no light when Off, a green light is displayed for Low, yellow for Med, red for High, then back to Off), you can easily verify which setting you are on.

The controller is also much, much larger than it needs to be and the cord is a lot stiffer than I would have liked.Ultimately, I found it impractical to apply this heating pad and multi-task.  Even when checking emails, I found it frustrating.  Due to the stiff cord, if I wanted the pad to stay put, it required constant holding resulting in one hand being occupied all the time.  Being large and on a stiff cord, the controller keeps flopping around and isn't ergonomic to hold to quickly grasp to change heating level.  The fragility of the heating system means strapping, pinching, or laying on the heating pad to keep it in place is out of the question.While the heating pad does heat up as expected, it is impractical for light/leisure use.

I’d give it a 50/50 in stars... when I received the package I’m guessing it must have been a return product because new packaging inside was open and the tape on the box was cut. I kept it anyway and it held up for about a month.The heat seems stronger the first few minutes of usage after turning it on, then it cools down a bit. Idk if that’s intentional or not but it’s not too bad. I do like that it automatically switches off so sleeping with it isn’t a bad idea, I don’t wake up overheated or red because of it.Unfortunately the button turned white about three months in. I’ve tried to see if I can scrape it off with my nail but it doesn’t come off. And for some reason it’ll sometimes just turn off and the light in the control will blink at me. I can’t turn it on until I’ve unplugged it and then plugged it in again.I believe I most likely just got a faulty returned product...and I should have returned it to begin with to get a replacement I suppose, but by the time any of this really starting to become obvious (the blinking and white stuff) my return date was over.Aside from this specific pads issues- my only product specific complaint is the spot the wire plugs into the pad is very large and uncomfortable to lay on. The pros of this pad is that it’s an automatic switch off, it’s very long (covers my whole back!), super soft, smells clean, and has a nice variety of heat to switch between depending on what you need. I enjoy using this for my cramps on bad days, too. Very soothing for my tummy. Overall I’d give 2/5 stars just because I’d gotten a bad item.

Low, Med and High. I typically use Medium and it's perfect. On summer days I use the Low setting and it relieves my back while also not overheating me.The only thing I wish was that it was wireless and more options for colors. I currently have this bright turquoise color which it ended up growing onto me -- but typically I like more neutral colors. The wire can be a bit annoying because I have to place the heating pad in a certain direction so the wire doesn't get caught in my chair when I'm moving around. It's not a huge deal though but it would just be cool if that were a possibility.Overall, it has helped me so much with my day to day at work.

I've always owned something cheap that I've picked up at the local Wally.  When I started having episodes of serious neck and back pain, I decided it was time to do something better.  Being a long-time Amazon shopper, I new that I could find both the best product and the best deal online.After extensive shopping and comparisons, this product appeared to be the best purchase choice for my money.  I received it the very next day, and I am SO glad that I made this choice!  First, the pad itself is soft and flexible, and will wrap around a knee or arm without any problem.  The heating control is very simple to use... there's one large button that you click once for low, again for medium, again for high, and a fourth time to turn it off.  Heat from this pad is nearly immediate... it's amazing how fast it heats up, and it then stays consistently warm.  Actually, I've only really used the pad on low, as the amount of heat it provides is amazing.  It has a longer cord so it's not been an issue to plug in where I need it.  I've used this every single evening for months, and it still looks like brand new.  This is a large pad, larger than most, so it has significantly more coverage area than those I've had in the past.If I had to find a ""con"" for the pad, I would have to point to the electrical connector that's on one corner of the pad.  This unit is designed so that you can remove the power source and clean the pad, which is highly unusual, and a positive.  The negative is that the connector is about 2 inches in diameter, very flat, and is a hard plastic.  All of this is great, but sometimes I have to work to position the pad so that I'm not feeling the connector.I would definitely purchase this product again... it's worth every penny and works far better than any I've used to date.  Kudos to the designer and thank you for the relief you provide for me every single evening!",WONDERFUL heating pad!,Verified Purchase,

The cord is super long - about 10' from the pad to the plug - making it easy to reach the most convenient outlet instead of one behind the bed. The controls are large and lighted. The auto-shutoff feature meant I fell asleep feeling secure. The low heat setting was almost too low to notice.

It takes about 1 minute to get to the right temp and it gets to the perfect temperature for me, never so hot I am burnt or in pain, but not usually ""not enough"", I'm pretty satisfied. I'm not sure exactly how the settings work, but I've found the heat is the same if you press Low or if you press High first (that is to say, if you press High and then after a while press low, the heat will decrease. I can't really tell a difference, but it's never bothered me because it's always enough heat for me.). I also should mention that after a while, even though the pad stays on, the heat output decreases. I'm not really sure why that is, but I usually just turn it off and then back on again and it heats back up in about a minute. Despite all that, I'm fairly certain it's way better than all the other heating pads on the market, and I still rather inexpensive compared with its competitors.Over all, I highly recommend this product, it's really durable and reliable, and I've had it now for 3 years through 4 moves and it still works just as well as when I first got it.",Woman's best friend,Verified Purchase,

Because of this it is difficult to prevent unintended changes in the control setting.

And to top off the design flaw the control button is elevated to at or above the housing so it is activated with the slightest movement of the control against a blanket or other object. The heating is also disappointing, it does well at first but within a minute or two the temperature limit kicks in and is MUCH lower than the setting you enjoyed for those first few minutes.

I also was looking for a decent range for temperature control: the adults need more warmth, the kids, less so. I wanted make sure the pad gave off warmth from end to end, not just at the center. Lastly, the price was important. As I said, we already own several pads and I didn’t want to pay a small fortune, especially if it gave out after a month.

I bought the Mighty Bliss heating pad for the many features listed and it looked super comfortable with the padding shown. (I didn't want plastic again) I've read the reviews and saw that there were many people who just raved over the relief they were getting with use of it. I also read on a review or two, that if you had an issue with it personally that it was a small company and you could write directly to them and they would make it right. (not a big manufacturing company where your complaint would get lost in the shuffle--- a big plus for me). I have to say that ordering through Amazon, it came very quickly and I was anxious to use it. It heated up to a comfortable setting on low and I found that if I walked away and forgot to turn it off like I have done many times that it has a two hour maximum shut off time.  So far after using for the past 2 months, I can say that my lower back pain has greatly decreased. Thank You Mighty Bliss!!!",Best Heating Pad Ever!!!,Verified Purchase,

I've had it for approx 2 months and no issues whatsoever. The heating pad also has an automatic 2-hour shutoff feature so it doesn't get dangerously hot and I don't have to worry about falling asleep with it. The other nice feature is the power cord is very long so I don't have to worry about finding a close enough outlet to use it either.If you're looking to upgrade your usual heating pad you'd buy at the drugstore, I definitely recommend this one.

I remedied this by keeping the control up high on a nightstand. It doesn't get as hot as I would like but it's still gets plenty hot.

To correct the issue requires unplugging the cord from the outlet and reconnecting it to the heating pad and then plugging it back into the wall. If you simply connect it back to the heating pad without unplugging it from the wall the heating pad will not start working again.

This is a good safety feature but it's very annoying as unless you're checking the control for the lights there is no other indications its turned itself off, no beeps or anything.

I keep it on low for quite awhile to release the tension in my back and shoulders (I have back issues and sit at a desk job 10 hrs/day). Additionally, the SIZE is great because it covers my back, and I can pull it up to wrap a bit over my shoulders. A good buy, and I’d purchase it again. P.S. It replaced a name-brand one that “died” after years of use.",Great size and works well,Verified Purchase,

My daughter suffers from Very bad monthlies and this heating pad has been a godsend for her. I was wary buying a brand I didn’t know, but the price was not outrageous and the color appealed to her teen senses. What a fantastic workhorse this pad is! First of all, the size is wonderful...because it is substantial, there’s no need to reposition several times during use, it covers a very large area for sweet relief EVERY TIME. The heat output is very good, too. It packs a very nice dose of heat with its easy to use control and you’re not left wishing the heat would go higher. Trust me, that’s not the case with all pads! Very happy with this purchase, thanks for a good product😀",Blissful relief every time!,Verified Purchase,

The instructions were very clear and the product itself is self-explanatory. The three heat settings are great. The pad heats up quickly and really helps with her pain, she only takes pain meds every few days now (never thought that would happen so wow).

I turned it on again randomly one day and to my complete surprise it got HOT! I’ve been using it faithfully ever since without any problems. I figure the problem I had initially may be a result of the heating pad just needing a few warm up runs to get it to function fully, so 4/5 stars, but I really do appreciate the heating pad now.

This one is great. It gets plenty warm for my needs and I love the soft cover. I noticed some negative reviews stating that this pad doesn't get warm enough. Blame the safety regulators not the manufacturer for that. My old heating pad did get much hotter to the point of being a skin burn risk. I'm just fine with how this one works. I often use it on the medium heat setting for my needs. Possibly the nice soft cover is a bit of a heat obstruction for some people? I like it just fine.  I highly recommend this heating pad.

Nothing on their website helped excepted they said they will stand behind their product but no troubleshooting.  I started troubleshooting on my own, more or less trial and error.  Plugged the pad directly into the socket, initially I was using an extension cord, disconnected the cord from the pad (this is how you can wash the pad but the manual is very vague.  Knowing that heating pads are polarity sensitive when it comes to electricity, I stuck the pad into the upper plug of the socket, guess what it worked, even with the extension cord.

I'm 5'11 and the length of this goes from my finger, and falls a few inches short of my shoulder. The width is a significantly smaller.  But I use it for my back and it gets a good area. It doesn't have a magnetic clip but it still sits well without it3) the heat is good -- the pad heats up quickly, but if you want to feel the full extent of the heat you have to press against it. I haven't tried the moist heating yet so I can't give any input on that. It helps with any soreness I may get from working out or if I have any sort of achiness. I usually only use medium heat and it feels great. I tried high once.  It felt good but I cranked it down to medium after a bit.4) it's fabric - it makes it a little hard to clean than a simple wipe. I have worked in research before and fabrics tend to have bacteria on them (be it clothes or any other product) so it's best to clean it. This can go in the machine or handwash. Since it's a heating pad, I chose the gentle option of hand washing. it took almost 24 hours for it to dry out but I be it would be faster with direct sunlight.

I use mine a lot, so I figure it's fair, but a little disappointing nonetheless, so I went with a different brand this time.At time of writing, this is a bit pricier than the Sunbeam, but it's about the same size. The color on this one is way more striking, and the fabric feels more plush. The cord is way longer than the Sunbeam's which is a huge plus for me, as I would often wish that the cord on the Sunbeam was just a little longer. It gets hot; for me, the lowest setting is enough.
