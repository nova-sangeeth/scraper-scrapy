I was sorely disappointed. I came to this item based on a search for a brand recommended from my physical therapist and was ecstatic to learn it was also one-day prime eligible. I immediately opened the box and followed the manufacturer's instructions to chill for 1-2 hours prior to use. I bought two; one for myself and my knee problems and another for my high-school athlete daughter for her knee as well. She tried hers a little before I did, so mine had a solid 2-3 hours in the freezer. When I initially used it, I was certain the towel had been too thick, it didn't chill long enough, etc. I decided to give it another try, and chilled a full 24-36 hours. I was still sorely disappointed. Imagine my level of disappointment to find that these items were unable to be returned! (Not yet 72 hours from delivery) Maybe mine was a dud? I have contacted amazon customer service and hopefully will come to a good resolution. (Still awaiting reply, credit &/ or refund.) Buyer beware: not always about the good reviews.

Why? Because this FlexiKold pack has a nylon outer jacket and the edge seams are sewn, not glued or thermally fastened like the ACE large cold compress. I played ice hockey goal for 40+ years and finally had to quit due to all manner of L4/L5/S1  low back, rotator cuff and knee problems. I live on ice packs and NSAID's after golf and the gym. The ACE packs last about 6 months before they pop a seam and the slimy cold pack guts coming slithering out, really greasy yet sticky goo. I've done that 4-5 times now in the past 2-3 years and it was a pain having the ACE packs leak so often and I got weary of stuffing them in a ZipLoc bag to prevent the goo from getting on my hands and clothes.I noticed that my PT guy uses FlexiKold packs daily at his practice and he told me they last years with 4-5 a day of continuous use in his office. Saw the FlexiKold products on Amazon and I'm sold. If I run into problems down the road, I'll report back but to my eye, the quality of the FlexiKold gel pack is far superior to the ACE products.There is a photo of my ACE cold pack on top of the new FlexiKold pack. You can see that the edges of the ACE bandage are either glued or thermally sealed and when you put pressure on the pack like using it on your low back, the seam eventually splits open. The FlexiKold pack is in a ripstop nylon pack and the edges are sewn with a cloth edge all the way around. The FlexiKold is a bit more money upfront but if I'm not buying a new one every 6 months, it's actually a lot cheaper.","Nylon cover is edge sewn, not the thermally glued like the ACE junk pads, FAR superior construction",Size: Large (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase,206 people found this helpful

Why? Because this FlexiKold pack has a nylon outer jacket and the edge seams are sewn, not glued or thermally fastened like the ACE large cold compress. I played ice hockey goal for 40+ years and finally had to quit due to all manner of L4/L5/S1  low back, rotator cuff and knee problems. I live on ice packs and NSAID's after golf and the gym. The ACE packs last about 6 months before they pop a seam and the slimy cold pack guts coming slithering out, really greasy yet sticky goo. I've done that 4-5 times now in the past 2-3 years and it was a pain having the ACE packs leak so often and I got weary of stuffing them in a ZipLoc bag to prevent the goo from getting on my hands and clothes.I noticed that my PT guy uses FlexiKold packs daily at his practice and he told me they last years with 4-5 a day of continuous use in his office. Saw the FlexiKold products on Amazon and I'm sold. If I run into problems down the road, I'll report back but to my eye, the quality of the FlexiKold gel pack is far superior to the ACE products.There is a photo of my ACE cold pack on top of the new FlexiKold pack. You can see that the edges of the ACE bandage are either glued or thermally sealed and when you put pressure on the pack like using it on your low back, the seam eventually splits open. The FlexiKold pack is in a ripstop nylon pack and the edges are sewn with a cloth edge all the way around. The FlexiKold is a bit more money upfront but if I'm not buying a new one every 6 months, it's actually a lot cheaper.","Nylon cover is edge sewn, not the thermally glued like the ACE junk pads, FAR superior construction",Size: Large (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase,206 people found this helpful

They  have  been frozen many times, but mostly I keep them in a mini fridge in my room and use them for when my husband or I have migraines. The XL stays cold for a really long time. Folded in half, it has a really nice weight to it and, unfolded, it’s large enough to wrap around my head. Neither one has never started leaking.I actually just ordered another XL so my husband and I would both have one. I definitely recommend the larger size as it does stay cold much longer than the smaller size (hours vs 20 minutes) and it’s more versatile. Keep in mind that if you do freeze it, the outside cover does get wet from frost as it starts melting. I prefer it out of the fridge. I have used it just at room temp when I’ve forgotten to put it back in the refrigerator and it still feels cool and stays cool for a good 30 minutes (the XL size) before it gets warm if you fold it and keep moving it to a cool section.","After 3 years, I just reordered the XL (so I don’t have to share mine with my husband 🤣)!",Size: X-LargeVerified Purchase,

I can wrap it completely around my leg (at the knee), thus getting cold to multiple areas.  It is much colder than the individual gel packs I have been using. Now it is definitely a five!

I bought the two-pack of this product because of the 2-hour freeze time, which allowed me to use one while the other is chilling, and the physical flexibility of the product (see further down why that mattered). I didn't really care if it stayed cold for 30 minutes or an hour, as the Rx was for 15 minutes at at time. It definitely lasts that long; probably 30 minutes, max.Instructions and posts here indicate placing a cloth between the pack and your skin. Maybe my refrigerator freezer is not that cold, or I have a high tolerance for cold — I DO love the winter — but I found it does not feel leg-freeze cold, nor does it burn my skin. Your mileage may vary on this point, depending on whether you use a deep freezer, a top or bottom freezer in a fridge and, of course, the temperature to which you have it set. I think I WOULD like it to be colder, but as I have a fridge with a bottom drawer freezer, turning up the cold will make the fruit and veggies in the top compartment freeze. And, at the end of the day, the current temp is doing the job well.All of the above allows me — a home-worker sitting at the computer — to just slip the pack down the front of the leg of my jeans (sorry, folks, no pix; this is a clean post) positioning it over the knee. At that point, I just  sit down, squeeze it securely around my knee through the pants, and I'm good to go for 15-20 minutes. In fact, it is so comfortable/form-fitting and effective that I forget that I have it on, pulling it off sometimes an hour later, then popping it back into the freezer.I highly recommend this product, in a two-pack,  for the purpose described here.",Half-size — inside pants — perfect for arthroscopic knee icing,Size:  Medium (Pack of 2)Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

It has just the right amount of gel inside to keep it firm yet flexible, not hard.  It is well made and is used often.  I put a dish towel around it before putting it on my back, as they suggest.  I like it so much that I decided to buy another one so I can be using one while the other is keeping cold and I can switch them out with each other :)  Thank you for a really super, well made and helpful product that can be used for aches on any part of the body.
