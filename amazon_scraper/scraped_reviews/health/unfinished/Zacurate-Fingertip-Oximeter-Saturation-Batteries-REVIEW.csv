It was packaged carefully, with a piece of foam to cushion it.Now my only complaint. Like almost everything I purchase made in China, there are little particles and small pieces of cardboard (?) which fell out of the box when I opened it. For ordinary household items, that is not a big deal, but since this is a medical device I think they should take more care in making the packaging part of the process clean.

Arrived when promised and is clearly new. (After receiving not one but two separate ones from a different vendor that were clearly used, I checked that first.)Pulse oximeters by nature give numbers that vary slightly from heart beat to heart beat. Seeing something like 96, 94, 98, 96, 98, 95 is normal, even in hospital settings. It's just the way our bodies work - a slight variation heart beat to heart beat. Circulatory issues play a role too. If your hands are cold, all pulse ox devices will have a hard time getting a reading. There isn't a lot of blood in a pale, freezing cold finger for it to get a reading from. Ditto that for especially low blood pressure. Or those with fingernail polish - it can't see thru the polish. And position - sometimes you have to reposition them a few times on the same finger, or use a different finger. And long nails push it too far back on your finger. It's the same drill regardless of home devices or hospital ones.This one seems reasonably accurate, for the little bit I have used it so far. It is good for learning what my baseline numbers are on most days, so if I get sick (get real..... When, not if, I'm not immune to every disease known to man) I can tell how far off things are. It shows a strong pulse wave form (meaning there is enough circulation in my finger for it to get a reading), and easy to read heart rate and oxygen status.For the very reasonable cost, it seems like a useful tool. ""Your mileage may vary "" If it helps prevent even one unnecessary trip to urgent care or the ER, it's worth it to me. If it gets me to go to urgent care or the ER when I don't want to, it's also worth it. (Nurses are notoriously bad about going infor care, even when really really sick, lol......😄) In all cases, if you get this gadget and are concerned about your readings, call your doctor.

I took readings every hour at work and at home. My oxygen saturation was actually very slightly improved with the mask ( I am required to wear it at work) and improved as the day went along. Nevertheless I am always wanting to come up for fresh air for a few moments from under the mask, and feel better when I do, but these readings don't support my supposition as to the cause.Nevertheless this seems to be a great product.

That's pretty much a go-to-the-ER reading, and didn't seem right, even though I have mild COPD.  Two days earlier my blood oxygen had been checked in the doctor's office, and was 95%.  Also, the readings bounced around a lot and sometimes never settled down; and once it gave an absurd number for my pulse.  So I did some research on line and bought the ZacUrate because of reviews saying it was very accurate (which for any oximeter is only +/- 2%).  The ZacUrate has consistently given readings of 95-97%.  I can't check this, but it seems right.  The ZacUrate also reads my pulse accurately (I've checked this).  A couple of points.  It takes a few seconds to give its readings.  And those readings do bounce around at first, especially the pulse .  I think this is normal, and they always settle down after I leave it on my finger for 30 seconds or so.  So far, I'm completely satisfied.",Seems to be accurate,Verified Purchase,

I read though the directions figuring I missed something and followed all of the instructions... Nothing. The unit did not recognize any of my fingers, ever, after many tries. So, again feeling it may be me- with slightly chilled fingers or not enough blood supply, we tried the unit on all of my wife's fingers, it registered on only one when holding the unit just perfect. (my wife is healthy with warm fingers) It took just over a minute to get a reading on the one finger and it came up with 73% blood oxygen. We tried again, same amount of time to get a reading, result was 76%. Absolutely ridiculous.There are many online articles that talk about how vendors manipulate ratings on shopping sites, and by no means am I an expert in this area, but it feels like that is what is happening here. 1540000 reviews at 4.5 positive suggests a product which is the best of the best, heck-at that rate even hospitals should switch to these!! And then, read some of the 5 star reviews and so many of them have the same verbiage, almost like 'Joe' from the east side of the US and 'Sam' who lives on the west side of the US are best friends and were on the phone when they submitted their reviews. It doesn't take an investigator to see a pattern in the majority of reviews and to feel suspicious of the reviews.I apologize for the lengthy review, but this has me ticked off. Final statement - this company appears to be willing to put others at risk, and if the thing about reviews is correct steps are then taken to manipulate the system without thought of the potential harm to others.Thank you for taking the time to read this, I do appreciate it.","Useless Product, returning",Verified Purchase,

Since my oxygen levels where low so one of the nurse's suggested that I invest in a oxygen monitor to help with my recovery at home. She suggested to check my level a few times a day, before and after taking a shower, moving around, going out of the house before and after and to keep a log of my oxygen levels so I can Let the Dr. know how my levels are doing and really just to help speed up my recovery cause after being on oxygen for a week and really no one telling me how to get better so I was able too wing myself off my oxygen by not using it sometimes and to see how long I can go without my oxygen before my oxygen level dipped to low. Now I'm not saying what I did is for everyone and really not safe to do but like I said no one was really giving me any advice on how to recover so I had to do a lot of research on the internet to come to a conclusion on my own and I was able to get off my oxygen after 19 days cause I was able to monitor my oxygen levels as I did my breathing exercises and using the oxygen off and on to wing myself off and like I said before not approvedby any Dr I just did it on my own. Just FYI during my search for answers on what should your oxygen levels be to be acceptable to get  off your oxygen? According to my Dr you should be at a steady 88% and above without oxygen but I suggest you talk to your Dr first as everyone's different and your Dr should be the one to take you off your oxygen after testing you to see if you can come off your oxygen.Now as far as I'm concerned I love this oxygen and heart rate meter it works perfect. I was skeptical buying it but it was worth it and the price ain't bad at all either for this unit. Even thought it says it could be off by 2+ or - I took mine to the Dr. With me to compare readings and it was off only by -1 so when I did my readings I just added 1 to my reading.

Also Re: the lanyard/cord length question that I asked: the consensus is that it is about 19 inches long (folded) when measuring the whole woven cord portion. Why am I telling you all this? In case you also have a heathen of a cat that finds the cord wrapped around the meter, proceeds to unwind it, and chew through it leaving you to wonder if she swallowed any. In this case... yes. She did. About 6 ish inches of it. Fortunately, she gave it back less than a day later, probably partially owing to the grass we gave her which bound around it and allowed her to void it orally before we knew the full length of the cord... Gross, I know. But it was better than other descriptors I could have used. Anyways, now you know the length of the cord. Also, please take your cat to the vet if they act at all out of the ordinary and you think they ate something they shouldn't have. We got lucky and her bratty self would have been at the vet if she'd had any lethargy or fever. The picture includes the offender, the meter, the chewed up cord that did not get swallowed, & a small fraction of her actual toys. The cord is safely in the trash now.

Let me just say I had high hopes for this one but, I have compared the heart rate and pulse ox against medical office equipment and against other pulse ox machines bought through Amazon.  The heart rate isn't even accurate, according to this I was up walking, speaking and overall functioning normal, but my heart rate was 23, not likely.  The heart rate is all over the place on this and it takes less than a breath for it to jump or drop 20 beats or more.  The pulse ox level is a bit more stable, it consistently reads 92-97, once it read 98, but it never matches any other machines.

As a background, I am 63 yr old but generally healthy.  I was prompted to buy a finger pulse oximeter, which to verify my drop in Pulse reading I was tracking from my Blood Pressure Device, and to understand if there was a correlating issue in my pulse reading and a lack of oxygenated blood flow.  My Resting Heart Rate (RHR) Pulse had drop from a benchmark of 60 beats/min to 50 and lately between 45-47 beats/min, however I did not experience any chest pains during High Intensity workouts, only symptoms was fatigue and light headiness when going from a sitting to standing position.  I posted a 25 sec video of my usage of the 500DL.  The out of box experience was easy, I followed the include QSG by inserting the 2 x AAA batteries, placing the device over my index finger, and simply pressing the ON button.  As my video shows the DL500 accurately confirmed my pulse reading between 45-47, and to my relief, reflected an SpO2 oxygen reading of 95%.  The FAQ on the back of the QSG was helpful to confirm 95% + is the measurement range I should be hoping to note.  With this information, I will be able to have a better discussion with my Doctor, having verified Pulse with two devices.  I will be able to continue to the ZacVrate when I take daily 3 mile neighborhood walks, or occasional strenuous 3 hour nature hikes, or during my weekly High Intensive Interval Training classes.

It doesn't read immediately and is pretty bare-bones, but it basically does what it's supposed to at a reasonable price.",Does the job!,Verified Purchase,

The quality is good.  A lanyard strap and rubber protective  cover are included.  The manual is fair. It covers the basic features of the device but it does not give an indication of what a good reading should be. There are severeal good videos on YouTube on how to use a pulse oximeter. I would recomment watching these. The device measures both pulse rate and oxygen saturation. I would recommend this device.,Very Easy To Use. Works as Expected,Verified Purchase,

It's frustrating that it takes so long to get a read though.  I just put it on and walked to the mailbox and back, which is about 50 yards total and took about 4 minutes, and the reading didn't appear until I got back to the house.  This isn't typical though.  It usually takes approximately 45 seconds for the reading to appear.  I'd prefer it was much quicker, as by the time the reading appears, I'm already recovering from the sob episode.",Not so sure,Verified Purchase,

Unfortunately, when I finally needed to use, it stopped functioning after less than 10 attempts. I immediately changed the batteries to absolutely brand new Duracell’s, and yet still no reading. When I hit the button, it lights up, but when you put your finger in, no matter how many people have tried, it does not give a reading!The batteries are in correctly, but it doesn’t seem to have a full charge which makes no sense. Clearly, I unfortunately received a defective unit, but because it’s outside of the return window, I am just out hard earned money.Very sad and disappointed, but more importantly, it put my health at risk because I bought this for a specific use, and now I can’t read my oxygen saturation levels during Health period in which it’s vitally important! Based on my experience, I would strongly recommend you seek another brand for this potentially life-saving device. If I should hear back from the company, and if they stand behind their products, I will update this review if I am able.","But in case I ever needed during pandemic.

I have no way to independently verify the oxygen readings, but it seems accurate based on what I know of my health history and having frequently been hooked up to the oxygen readers at doctor's offices and hospitals. It's easy to store between uses and the little silicone case that comes with it is very handy since it has a carrying strap you can attach to that too.","It is easy to read, easy to use, and seems accurate.",Verified Purchase,
