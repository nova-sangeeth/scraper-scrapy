I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say. It's a decent watch, but I'd wait for it to go on sale.","Pretty good, with some gripes. Buy it on sale.",Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,"1,426 people found this helpful"

Fair warning though on some things I didn’t realize: you need Spotify premium to use any of the Spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer. And according to their website if you use the GPS feature the Fitbit battery only lasts 5 hours. So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you’re exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to “work properly” I don’t like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven’t had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way. My boyfriend loves the sleep mode feature that turns off notifications and screen wake so when I toss and turn at night I don’t accidentally blind him with my watch screen if it goes off.,A great upgrade from a charge 2 but some things to note...,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,"1,405 people found this helpful"

I have tried to move away from Fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs, but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time. Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.","GPS is good, special edition band is not...",Color: Black/Granite ReflectiveEdition: Special EditionVerified Purchase,803 people found this helpful

My first I had for about 6 years and only replaced because of a failed integrated band, and the second in 4 years due to a failing battery.I've had the Charge 4 for about 2 months now. Bought it as a first adopter because of the GPS feature (guess that was my mistake.) I need pacing and route tracking for my daily PT, and hate the more advanced but bulky ""Smart Watches"". With that said, out of the box it looks great, seems to be good quality and with a good feature set. And that's about where it ends.Functionality - The GPS works optimistically about 20% of the time. If it connects at all, it takes about 5 minutes to do so, and if you run/walk/ruck more than a mile it will disconnect multiple times. If you start a workout without the GPS, it may or may not start tracking half way through the workout. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that ALL tracking features of this model use the GPS location for analytics. In an 8 mile ruck, the watch will reconnect about every half mile (or not at all) which means the watch thinks you walked in place for 1.5 hours in 'peak' heart rate, which doesn't accurately calculate pace or caloric burn...Additionally, because of this fault; the auto workout tracking feature generally just stops tracking at all about 10 minutes into any workout because it doesn't think you're doing anything and reverts to the home screen. So as a tracker, it's worthless.Build Quality - While it came out of the box nice and tight the removable band has, in two months, loosened up enough that it will just randomly pop loose at the body connector under normal walking circumstances, rendering the watch useless in your pocket (see pic). I give it another month at best before the band won't attach at all.Operation - They may come out with another firmware update to fix this problem, but if not the watch has to be re-paired with the Fitbit app at least once a week. The app itself is really nice, with some great features, but the Charge 4 looses connection for some reason, and has to be 'removed' and 're-paired' for it to start sending information again. Each time you re-pair, it has to be completely re-configured for messaging etc. I just gave up on that feature...With all of that said, this has turned out to be a $150 dollar heart rate monitor and stop watch, and a glitchy one at that. I'm not at all impressed with the operation and would not recommend to anyone till they figure out and fix the issues. Poor look Fitbit. I'll look at Garmin or something else that may actually work.","My advice... Steer clear of this thing.

The Charge 4 came with some charge on its battery, and I was able to initially charge it to 100% and update its firmware. After about 5 days of use, the Charge 4 died, and I was unable to recharge it. I tried 3 different chargers, and tried to reset it per Fitbit restore instructions, nothing helped. I thought of exchanging it for another Charge 4, but there are too many other fitness trackers available, that I don't feel like taking another chance on a Fitbit 4.

I upgraded to this after my Charge 2 wore out (had it for 4 years, daily use). It does not consistently track my exercises or sleep stages. It also does not work with phone notifications. It doesn't alert me when I have a text or call like it's supposed to do. I've had it for 3 months, and it hasn't worked well since I got it (see more detailed review below).  I do NOT recommend this.I exercise 6 to 7 days a week. The Charge 4 does not register that I've completed the daily exercise and doesn't register active zone minutes consistently. I like to see how many times per week and per month I worked out, and normally, fitbit tracks this and makes it easy to see at a glance. The Charge 4 does not track it. In the last 4 weeks, I worked out all but 4 days total. The Charge 4 shows that I only worked out once per week. It's inaccurate and does not track. The active zone minutes sometimes track correctly, but it's really inconsistent. The active zone minutes also do not appear to sync with the daily exercise tracking. If using the fitbit to track anything resulted to exercise, it's useless.I also went with the Charge 4 because of its  increased sleep tracking capabilities. More often than not, it does not register my sleep stages or heart rate fluctuations. It says it couldn't do so. This is incredibly frustrating as this was one of the main reasons I went with the Charge 4.I did not have these issues with my Charge 2. The Charge 4 has not worked well at all for the full 3 months I've had it. At most, it registered if I did a 20 to 30 minute walk, but any other exercises I have done do not register or track.I do not recommend this, and I'm highly disappointed and dissatisfied with the Charge 4, especially for the price I paid. It's also frustrating that I bought a new fitbit, to track fitness and sleep, and it does neither.

One other important that I noticed is that if I tie my fitbit charge 4 too tight on my wrist, it messes up the sleep calculation. I think I consciously tied it tighter for 3 nights and all 3 nights, it did not give me a sleep score saying that I was too restless. But, I feel its due to some technical issue. This actually was concerning since now I am not sure how reliable is the heart rate sensor on my fitbit. Overall, I think I like the design and it is very comfortable. You can easily wear it all the time without noticing which is not true for (say) apple watch. This is the best thing about charge 4. I think fitbit still needs to work on quality and is not on par with apple. I agree there is a difference in price but accuracy and battery life are 2 important things which shouldnt depend on it.

While working in the galley of a seafood processing plant last year in Alaska, I decided I wanted to use such an alarm again, and downloaded Sleepzy, a freemium Android app. It worked very well, but I wanted to see if I could get something more accurate, especially with having roommates walking around in those kinds of work environments. (When working like 16 hours a day, every minute of sleep, but especially the mental aspect of it, is super important.)After asking my friends and browsing through the selection on Amazon, I figured that the FitBit Charge 4 was the smart watch for me. I did have some trouble choosing because the Smart Wake Feature isn't really advertised prominently - I had to search through many reviews and questions. Then this summer, working those long hours in the processing plant while being pregnant, getting enough sleep and maintaining mental clarity was even more important. Sadly, I don't think the FitBit held up.Some of my first impressions:-Kinda cool but creepy that my phone detected the FitBit before I even turned on bluetooth-Didn't like how you have to have wifi connection (not just the bluetooth turned on) to send the FitBit data to the smartphone app-Based on the last one, I signed up for the trial of FitBit premium, which was practically useless to me after I realized the whole wifi/bluetooth thing wouldn't work while I was up working in remote parts of Alaska-Tracking steps and stuff is neat, I guess, not really why I got it, and since I don't like carrying my phone around everywhere, it does keep better track of itSmart Wake troubles:-You only can set it for 30 minutes before the alarm goes off, versus with Sleepzy (yes, what I'm comparing it to), you can choose 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes-Despite what I was hoping for, the FitBit didn't work well with roommates walking around - hell, it may have been worse than with Sleepzy-Without FitBit Premium, Sleepzy tells me almost about the same as FitBit's app does-The absolute worst: sometimes the alarm wouldn't go off until AFTER the alarm was supposed toLet me elaborate on the last part. Luckily, I discovered this was a thing early on before I had to learn the very, very hard way. When it first happened, the alarm went off just a few minutes after it was supposed to. The next few times, like 10-15 minutes afterwards. I'm pretty paranoid about my alarms, and have meant to always set two, I guess this FitBit is like an expensive second alarm clock (well, it's the first in line). I have no idea if this happens when the Smart Wake is off. One time, I woke up before work from the FitBit alarm, and I felt something was wrong - I felt more well-rested, and right away, I checked the time and found I only had three minutes before I was supposed to clock in for work (the alarm went off a full half hour after it was supposed to). By the time I was almost out the door, the bunkhouse manager came to get me, which was embarrassing. Because of my sleepiness, I had forgotten to put the backup alarm on my phone when I hooked it up to charge. With all of the other non-Sleep Wake setbacks, which I'll get to in a moment, I thought I'd rate this 3/5 stars, but with this utter failure, it's no more than a 2 for me. I *know* that with the other times, it wasn't a case of me sleeping through the alarm, because as soon as I would wake up after the alarm was supposed to go off (whether because I got up naturally, from my roommates, or my backup alarm), THEN it would go off.Other setbacks:-Doesn't seem like I can set a countdown and do other stuff on the FitBit at the same time (the timer pauses)-While it normally has a more-or-less steady battery life, especially when I was in Alaska, the remaining power would greatly fluctuate; sometimes it took more than a few days to get from fully-charged to less than 50%, on other days, it took like 12 hoursThis is not necessarily a criticism, but I think it's weird that they don't already do something for this. You can track menstruation stuff with FitBit Premium, but there was nothing pregnancy-related. I thought that maybe the FitBit could help me keep better track of health things during this specific time, but I guess not.ONE thing I will say I like about it is the ""silent"" alarm - the vibrations. It has both regular and stronger settings. I asked a roommate if she ever heard it go off, but she didn't. I've seen some reviewers say that even the stronger is not enough for them, but I think that I'm a light enough sleeper for where it works well for me.If you're the kind of person who really likes tracking their steps, miles walked, heartrate, stories climbed, and calories burned, maybe this would be good for you, but I've read that cheaper competitors' watches do just about the same (unfortunately, I couldn't find any with smart alarms). Most of the people who are reading this, you probably have different needs than mine with what you hope for from a FitBit, but if you happen to be like me and really wanted the Smart Wake, just download Sleepzy or some other smartphone app instead.","Got it primarily for the Smart Wake, doesn't hold up",Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,

I had decided that the Apple Watch was not for me and that the devoted fitness tracker was the way to go. I was happy with it for 4 months. I charged it daily even though it is supposed to keep a charge for about a week. And I used it mainly to track my walking routine.  Though the device is a bit generous often counting as steps simple hand movements, I had no serious complaints. And I was impressed with the tracking of my sleep cycle. So, I was happy that I had avoided the fate mentioned in a number of the reviews on this site about the sudden death of devices. I thought I was through the woods. Then, I got the smiley face of death. The device just stopped working. I hooked it up to the charger, trying desperately to resuscitate it. I spent hours troubleshooting, including following steps on the Fitbit website and watching videos on YouTube.Most frustrating, however, was the waiting to get help from Fitbit.  I initially tried chatting online, but after a couple of hours and restarts realized that Fitbit just does not tend to their online chat. Then, my wait moved to the phone, which is tedious for me because I am hearing impaired. The first advocate's -- Fitbit's term -- background noise was unbearable and she eventually simply hung up on me. The second person seemed to whisper even after I made him aware of my hearing impairment. Overall, the experience was awful.This predictable failure of the device -- predictable because so many customers have complained about it in online forums -- along with the poor customer support are the reason for the 2 stars. To Fitbit's credit, they offered to send me another device.  But many of the reviews that I initially ignored mention receiving replacement devices only to have the same problem reoccur. So, I am not holding my breath here and am instead steeling myself to have to buy an Apple Watch.In short, I am disappointed rather than focused on my fitness. And feel a bit silly for ignoring the many reviews that describe my eventual experience.

But you’ll stop wearing it at night entirely when your partner complains to you that’s the 3rd night in a row that the green sensor light woke her up when you shifted in bed, and threatens separate bedrooms. That sensor light at the back may seem innocent enough in the daytime, but at night it’s strong enough to summon Batman. And apparently nobody thought to dim it when the tracker figures out you are asleep.You’ll discover that connecting to GPS can take 3 seconds, 3 minutes or 3 hours, randomly, even in areas of strong signal coverage. You’ll have to decide whether to stand by your bike watching that jerky triangle symbol, or just take off and have the thing act as a glorified stopwatch. Somewhere, in the continental USA, there’s a skeleton lying next to a bike, all that remains of a Fitbit wearer who decided to wait for a GPS connection. Eventually you’ll come to the realization that tracking your exercise geographically isn’t a right, it’s a privilege that Fitbit, in its munificence, bestows on you occasionally, perhaps on Hindu Holy Days.Don’t expect to be able to see the display outside, in natural light. You can’t. The pale, greyish text on a black background is designed to cause eyestrain. My exercise mode of choice is cycling. And I’ve concluded that either the Fitbit engineers don’t actual cycle at all, or they all have recessed vole genes and cycle at midnight on cloudy days during power outages. It’s one or the other.And even if you can see it, in a dark alley, the thing flashes constantly between Cardio and Fat Burn or congratulates you on 300 steps an hour or doing a washing load or baking a cake, basically anything it can think of to stop you seeing useful information at the flick of a wrist, like how far or how long you’ve been exercising.And your tracker wants to thwart you from turning GPS off afterwards, there’s no option to keep it on only for the duration of the exercise, you’ll have to swipe left, right, up and down 15 times to find it again afterwards, or more likely, you’ll forget entirely and it will need recharging within the hour again. BTW, don’t even think about exercising with anything less that 35% charge. You’ll see the drained battery symbol in no time.Fitbit is about to be acquired by Google. And Google, like V’Ger in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, exist to Know All That Is Knowable. Now I’m not saying NASA needs to shoot Google executives into Deep Space, but it would spare us having to watch them lie to House and Senate committees every three months.Perhaps you can reconcile yourself not to mind that Google are collecting your biometric data and tracking your every waking movement so they can show you ads for Preparation H or congratulate you on your pregnancy before you are even aware you are pregnant (this is not a Joke, this is a Thing – read the NYT article about Target Stores and data mining).

Almost nothing about it actually works.The good:* Sleep tracking seems to work decently. It rarely records me as awake when I'm asleep and vice versa.The bad:* Heart rate is off very often. At rest it will sometimes display twice my heart rate (e.g. it will show 140 bpm when my pulse is 70 as measured by hand or an arm cuff). While exercising it will sometimes show a value half my heart rate (might show 60 when my pulse is clearly 120 bmp), and sometimes it's off by some other factor, generally much higher than my actual pulse.** Heart rate is used to calculate calories burned and 'active zone minutes', so neither of those values are meaningful since they are based on bad data.* Steps. Not very accurate. I've tried walking 10 steps in a straight line and seeing how many steps are counted. Sometimes it counts 0, sometimes it counts more than 10. Sometimes after I stop and look at the steps, I'll watch the number continue to increment up to half a dozen additional steps while I stand motionless.* The android app is really bad. The 'home' screen that shows overviews of the main stats and the sub-screens for specific stats often disagree. Sometimes the home screen will show up to date data while the sub-screens have outdated data, but more often the subscreens have updated data that the home screen does not show. For example:** The 'steps' sub-screen usually shows hours where I hit the steps goal that are not shown in the home screen unless I kill and restart the app. The home screen might say I hit my goal for 1 hour while the steps sub-screen will say I hit it for 2 hours. Killing and restarting the app (which will quickly become habit if you buy one of these), often fixes that.** The heart rate sub-screen shows little sparklines, one for each day, but those plots don't actually update unless you go into the sub-sub-screen by tapping the sparkline. Once you've gone to the full screen plot for a specific day, the sparkline will show correctly in the heart rate sub-screen (but not always). Until I do that, I just see blank space where the heart rate plots should be.** The weight tracking feature is buggy and sometimes changes values I've entered. If I enter 157, it usually changes to 156.9 when I hit save. If I try entering it repeatedly, eventually it will keep the correct value.* Spam. I get spam friend requests weekly from the 'community' features of that app that I do not use. These cannot be disabled. I block and report the profiles, but it doesn't stop the next spam request that is sure to come along. How are they even finding me if I don't use any of those community features?Overall I am very disappointed and strongly recommend against buying one of these.",Almost no features work correctly,Color: Black/Granite ReflectiveEdition: Special EditionVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I've not been disappointed!Pros: Accurate heart rate and sleep tracking (including oxygen level fluctuations), and I really like the Active Zone minutes feature, which tracks your cardio activity toward a goal each week. Plus, they have a good variety of programmed exercise options - I've tried boot camp, weights, walk, run, swimming, and kayaking (""outdoor exercise""), and they all tracked well. It syncs easily with your phone for notifications (or that can be turned off if you want to disconnect). I like that it has a button feature for control. Also, I have a small wrist, and I don't like anything bulky, so I appreciate the size.Cons: It's hard to wake up the screen just by raising your arm (can take a really big arm swing and it doesn't always catch it without using the button), and if you're outside in full sunlight, the display is hard to see. I had also read enough reviews about the GPS draining that I decided to turn that feature off for walks or runs, though to be honest, that hasn't really bothered me, since it's still tracks distance and other stats like that without GPS. If I go for a longer hike, I'll just plan to turn it back on.Overall, the charge 4 has the features I wanted without the ones I don't, and its smaller size means I can forget it's there when I'm not working out.",Glad I replaced my old Charge 2,Color: Rosewood/RosewoodEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,

I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say.

Fair warning though on some things I didn’t realize: you need Spotify premium to use any of the Spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer. And according to their website if you use the GPS feature the Fitbit battery only lasts 5 hours. So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you’re exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to “work properly” I don’t like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven’t had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way.

I have tried to move away from Fitbit due to my propensity for longer runs, but the features covered in their one app bring me back every time. Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.","GPS is good, special edition band is not...",Color: Black/Granite ReflectiveEdition: Special EditionVerified Purchase,803 people found this helpful

My first I had for about 6 years and only replaced because of a failed integrated band, and the second in 4 years due to a failing battery.I've had the Charge 4 for about 2 months now. Bought it as a first adopter because of the GPS feature (guess that was my mistake.) I need pacing and route tracking for my daily PT, and hate the more advanced but bulky ""Smart Watches"". With that said, out of the box it looks great, seems to be good quality and with a good feature set. And that's about where it ends.Functionality - The GPS works optimistically about 20% of the time. If it connects at all, it takes about 5 minutes to do so, and if you run/walk/ruck more than a mile it will disconnect multiple times. If you start a workout without the GPS, it may or may not start tracking half way through the workout. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that ALL tracking features of this model use the GPS location for analytics. In an 8 mile ruck, the watch will reconnect about every half mile (or not at all) which means the watch thinks you walked in place for 1.5 hours in 'peak' heart rate, which doesn't accurately calculate pace or caloric burn...Additionally, because of this fault; the auto workout tracking feature generally just stops tracking at all about 10 minutes into any workout because it doesn't think you're doing anything and reverts to the home screen. So as a tracker, it's worthless.Build Quality - While it came out of the box nice and tight the removable band has, in two months, loosened up enough that it will just randomly pop loose at the body connector under normal walking circumstances, rendering the watch useless in your pocket (see pic). I give it another month at best before the band won't attach at all.Operation - They may come out with another firmware update to fix this problem, but if not the watch has to be re-paired with the Fitbit app at least once a week. The app itself is really nice, with some great features, but the Charge 4 looses connection for some reason, and has to be 'removed' and 're-paired' for it to start sending information again. Each time you re-pair, it has to be completely re-configured for messaging etc. I just gave up on that feature...With all of that said, this has turned out to be a $150 dollar heart rate monitor and stop watch, and a glitchy one at that. I'm not at all impressed with the operation and would not recommend to anyone till they figure out and fix the issues. Poor look Fitbit. I'll look at Garmin or something else that may actually work.","My advice... Steer clear of this thing.

But you’ll stop wearing it at night entirely when your partner complains to you that’s the 3rd night in a row that the green sensor light woke her up when you shifted in bed, and threatens separate bedrooms. That sensor light at the back may seem innocent enough in the daytime, but at night it’s strong enough to summon Batman. And apparently nobody thought to dim it when the tracker figures out you are asleep.You’ll discover that connecting to GPS can take 3 seconds, 3 minutes or 3 hours, randomly, even in areas of strong signal coverage. You’ll have to decide whether to stand by your bike watching that jerky triangle symbol, or just take off and have the thing act as a glorified stopwatch. Somewhere, in the continental USA, there’s a skeleton lying next to a bike, all that remains of a Fitbit wearer who decided to wait for a GPS connection. Eventually you’ll come to the realization that tracking your exercise geographically isn’t a right, it’s a privilege that Fitbit, in its munificence, bestows on you occasionally, perhaps on Hindu Holy Days.Don’t expect to be able to see the display outside, in natural light. You can’t. The pale, greyish text on a black background is designed to cause eyestrain. My exercise mode of choice is cycling. And I’ve concluded that either the Fitbit engineers don’t actual cycle at all, or they all have recessed vole genes and cycle at midnight on cloudy days during power outages. It’s one or the other.And even if you can see it, in a dark alley, the thing flashes constantly between Cardio and Fat Burn or congratulates you on 300 steps an hour or doing a washing load or baking a cake, basically anything it can think of to stop you seeing useful information at the flick of a wrist, like how far or how long you’ve been exercising.And your tracker wants to thwart you from turning GPS off afterwards, there’s no option to keep it on only for the duration of the exercise, you’ll have to swipe left, right, up and down 15 times to find it again afterwards, or more likely, you’ll forget entirely and it will need recharging within the hour again. BTW, don’t even think about exercising with anything less that 35% charge. You’ll see the drained battery symbol in no time.Fitbit is about to be acquired by Google. And Google, like V’Ger in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, exist to Know All That Is Knowable. Now I’m not saying NASA needs to shoot Google executives into Deep Space, but it would spare us having to watch them lie to House and Senate committees every three months.Perhaps you can reconcile yourself not to mind that Google are collecting your biometric data and tracking your every waking movement so they can show you ads for Preparation H or congratulate you on your pregnancy before you are even aware you are pregnant (this is not a Joke, this is a Thing – read the NYT article about Target Stores and data mining).

And it wasn’t. I received this unit exactly 2 weeks ago to the day, charged it to full and have only charged it on Sundays since.In full disclosure, I do not keep my phone’s Bluetooth setting on all the time, nor do I use all the available bells and whistles of the Charge 4, I only track certain parameters:• Steps and reminders to move (when studying and working, ya sometimes forget to get up!)• Stairs• Sleep (it’s kinda close most times)• Zone minutes• Miles• Calories and weight• Heart rate.I also track my fluid intake and only sync with the app once or twice daily. That’s all I need. I do participate in weekly, sometimes daily or weekend challenges and syncing like this serves this purpose as well.I don’t like the distraction of unnecessary notifications and I don’t give apps a lot of access to my personal info so the Fitbit app doesn’t have access to my contacts, texts, etc. and I don’t use GPS, the available training program, etc. Since I'm using an older S7 which doesn't have the battery life of newer Android phones, I don’t want to drain my phone’s battery with unnecessary power usage. Even with all the time I use it, this app doesn't do that.I occasionally give access to my location or utilize the activity timers. Activities are also customizable through the app. Contrary to the alert inside the app, location is not necessary to sync – only Bluetooth communication between the unit and the app. If you’re a marathon runner or you like tracking everything, the Charge 4 is an inexpensive way to enable many connectivity options.I’m very happy that the Fitbit-compatible bands I used with my Charge 3 also fit this model (pictured). As with the Charge 3, the description says this unit comes with 2 bands but it’s really 1 ½ so if you damage the clasp, you can’t use either. Also, the original bands aren't as adjustable as I'd like, whether you use the large or small. Fortunately, there are many options out there that are even better than the basic bands included with the unit.My only other complaint is that the charger is attached to a slow charging cable, so it matters not if I plug this into a fast charging outlet. It takes a long time to charge but, since I’m only charging once weekly, I guess I can live with that.Almost forgot to mention that the clock face options have greatly improved since the last model. This is a very versatile tool at a great price point. In response to the pandemic sitch, there's an option in the app for free access to training tools for which there's usually a fee (for a limited time). The available challenges and community resources can be quite useful, especially now if you’re feeling isolated or just need to learn new fitness methods. Once you set up your unit to your liking, you'll quickly get the hang of it, I think it'll be a great addition to anyone's health and wellness routine, beginners and beyond.",Charge 3 bands fit and many app options,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,59 people found this helpful

Just completely stopped working. Cheap piece of garbage not worth the money!This is my first Fitbit and it was not a good experience. The Charge 4 gave me a lot of trouble initially starting it up and getting it to connect to the Fitbit app. I even had to contact customer service and it took several tries. After that, I've been using it a few weeks to test it out and so far, the performance has not been worth the $150. The accuracy is pretty good and I enjoy the sleep mode (when it works), that it measures heartbeat and steps and calories burned and whatnot. That's all good. However one of the promises of this Fitbit is that it can connect to Spotify through the Fitbit. I have done everything necessary to try and set it up but my Fitbit refuses to link up with the app. Considering this is one of the main reasons I bought the Charge 4, I'm extremely disappointed.There's also really not much to the Charge 4. I thought I did my research beforehand pretty well but apparently I missed that the apps you can use with Fitbit really only work with the Versa's according to the Fitbit app store.Basically, the Charge 4 isn't bad but it's just a tracker. I could have bought one of the much, much cheaper fitbits and gotten the exact same results. So the Charge 4 doesn't give anything special to it's customers aside from being waterproof and able to track heartbeat (which a few other models do too). There's nothing in particular that makes having this model worth it and I'm pretty upset that I spent $150 on a Fitbit that barely works, constantly has issues, can't use apps in general or even the apps it promised such as Spotify, and has no interaction with the screen besides scrolling to look at stats.I might look into other models of Fitbit but honestly, this hasn't been a good first impression and it doesn't make me want to buy their products in the future.",Breaks After A Few Months - Not Worth The Money,Color: Rosewood/RosewoodEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,63 people found this helpful

I work out with a sandbag and it's absolutely useless if you are doing something like cleans. I wear it two finger-widths up and relatively tight and it takes about 45 seconds to a full minute to catch my heart rate after a set, even doing something like pushups. In fact I've even had it happen with unweighted body squats. The only exercise where it is almost perfectly accurate seems to be riding a stationary bike. Sweat doesn't seem to be a huge factor as I sweat buckets on that bike and it works great. This is definitely the biggest issue.- the standalone GPS on the Charge 4 takes a long time, 4 or 5 minutes, to initialize, and it's gotten to the point where not using phone GPS is actually a real pain since the app requires always-on location services on the phone for ""Bluetooth low energy scans"" to sync, which seems like sort of a non sequitur anyway. I take my phone on walks so standalone GPS is not an upsell, especially when it's considerably worse than phone GPS.- paywalling the advanced sleep reporting features on an already expensive device. I just can't support this as a business practice.- the additional ""premium"" feature is access to workout videos. The app (on a Samsung Galaxy S10+) has entirely different offerings than the Coach app, but only the Coach app is able to cast to my TV. I did the fitness test on the Coach earlier today, which says at the beginning that it will be a series of exercises with corresponding ratings, and the video shows someone setting rep counts on a slider. The actual video is a monolithic 6 minutes with no breaks between segments followed by a series of smiley faces to self-assess how you did. I probably didn't do super well doing pike presses because I did pushups 10 seconds before, is that a sad face? Was I supposed to pause it? Even as a bundled feature this was pretty disappointing, especially figuring out I was either supposed to watch Fitbit app Discover programs on my phone or pick something totally different from the Coach.- minor stuff: the app is fairly comprehensive but you don't seem to be able to zoom in on graphs or even rotate them to landscape. The watch tends to vibrate too much with various numbers during exercise, some are starred, some are Active Minutes which confusingly pop only in intervals of 22, and I get about 5 or 6 buzzes during an individual workout. Notifications from my phone never worked. The ""relax"" app consistently tells me I'm doing a terrible job even when I'm synced to its rhythm. Lastly the only real differences between the Charge 4 and the Inspire HR are standalone GPS, Active Zone Minutes which is a made-up concept anyway, payments (which are cool), Spotify controls and a slightly larger form factor. Up to you whether that's worth 50 extra dollars.My watch failed to sync for 2 hours tonight and that was the final straw. I'm sure it's great for specific use cases but overall it's not quite there. I had a Microsoft Band 2 in 2014 and the Charge 4 is 0% better than my fitness tracker from 6 years ago aside from aesthetics and construction. Might be good for someone who wants one app for everything, doesn't care a huge amount about the fine details, and only does spinning classes or runs without their phone.",Not great,Color: Black/Granite ReflectiveEdition: Special EditionVerified Purchase,19 people found this helpful

In the beginning, I was expecting a good tracker for my sport activities and a way to monitor my sleep. The Charge 4 has delivered that, and much, much more, it has become an essential companion that is always there to nudge me to do better and provides amazing and detailed feedback on my progress at all levels.The cardiac activity tracker is simply amazing, the calorie counter very helpful to keep on top of a healthy diet, and the sleep analyzer provides great insight on quality of sleep, from which I have derived better sleep habits.Sport tracker is great, with multiple sports to choose from and automatic detection of activity. The GPS is a nice feature, but does consume quite a bit of battery life (about 15% per hour). Without using the GPS, I have been to up to 8 days between charges. I highly recommend using the ""Sleep mode"" at night to conserve battery life.The Charge 4 is light, unobtrusive, comfortable to wear, verifiably waterproof. Best of all, it does not burden you with all the technical complexity of what is does ""behind the scenes"", but instead presents you with simple and easy to understand reports (and great advice & recommendations too).I was never a big fan of ""meditation"", but I have to confess, I used the various sessions provided, and it does feel good. I am using the Premium feature (free for 3 months).I have not yet set up the touchless payment option, but will set it up, this sounds like a very attractive feature, especially if needing to purchase something when full wallet is left home.Gripes:1) The app is nice, but could be made a little more intuitive, it looks like it's been evolved over a long period of time by different teams with slightly different (well, quite different) ideas about user interface. Does the job, though if sometimes a little confusing.2) The Spotify feature is kinda useless, because it requires you to carry your phone with you, so it's just a Spotify remote control. I have removed it entirely to clean up the menus.3) It would be nice to be able to re-arrange the menus on the device.Despite a few glitches, I think Fitbit has a home run with this product.",This device is changing my life for the better,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,14 people found this helpful

In fact, I’ve been using FitBits since they debuted. When my Charge 2 started to have issues holding a charge a few weeks ago, I started saving for the replacement. Since it lasted me so long (they are durable!), FitBit had already come out with the 4.I love the upgraded screen, FitBit settings, and expanded exercise list with the Charge 4. I haven’t synced to my Spotify account, but I like that I could if I wanted to. I also like that I can put the FitBit into Do Not Disturb and Sleep life’s to prevent cellphone/text notifications any time I want. (I like to dedicate my workout time to my actual workouts and actually won’t even bring my phone into the gym so people can’t distract me from my workout or interrupt me.)That being said - I have to clean it after every single workout. Years and years ago, FitBit bands were permanently attached to the watch face. The adhesive, when combined with sweat, caused people to have allergic reactions. I was one of them and still carry permanent scarring on my wrist where the reaction had caused my skin to rip open. They fixed this when they moved to the detachable bands. However - I noticed I started having allergic reactions to the Charge 4 a couple hours after my workout. If I clean the watch back with rubbing alcohol after my workout and let it dry - I don’t seem to have an issue. I’m concerned about the charging port now being the source but so far - as long as I clean it immediately after, there are no issues at all and the raised red bumps I experienced the first 2 days has completely subsided.**Edit**I had to take another star off. I also cannot sleep in it due to the stationary position, which keeps the tracker in one place too long. Woke up with a reaction under the tracker. So I will no longer be able to track my sleep.

I charged it to 100% and lasted 3.5 days. After the recharge, it is at 31% right now, which is two days later.2) The touch screen does not work with sweaty fingers during a workout or if you want to stop a workout.3)  Starting a workout is not very quick. It goes through a “connecting” process which can last a couple minutes.OTHER1) Charge the Fitbit before starting. Make sure it clasps on correctly. I thought I had done it right, but only to find out it wasn’t charging.2) The only difference between the Charge 4 and Charge 4 special edition is the Extra band. I like the band. From what I could tell the band bought separately usually costs more than $20. But if you like one that is less than $20, recommend buying the Charge 4 and band separately.FINAL THOUGHTI’m still on the fence this is the right wearable for me. Will continue to try it out and see how continues to work. The charging is a big issue partly because advertising 7 days of charged capacity is a huge variance with reality of 3.5.

The Spotify control feature on your watch just controls pausing, next song, previous song, shuffle, and what devices to play the music on if you have multiple Bluetooth devices linked to your phone. The watch itself cannot link to or store Spotify songs. You have to bring your phone on runs if you want to listen to Spotify.The second thing is if you are going to use Fitbit Pay, not all credit/debit cards will work. The primary credit card I use was not supported, but the second card I tried did work. If you only have one or two cards and you plan on using this feature, I would look at the list of supported banks on the Fitbit website before you buy.

The final nail in the coffin for me was the morning it showed my resting heart rate at 102. I felt my pulse and it felt quite normal to me, not the galloping 102 it was registering.

The other thing, I've noticed is that if I do a U-turn in my run, my pace drops substantially. This likely indicates that the FitBit is not seeing all the distance that's traveled as a result of the U turn.Sleep Tracking is a neat feature, but seeing how poorly it rates my sleep makes me somewhat anxious.

Unfortunately they have come way down in quality also. I dont usually leave product reviews, but I am so disappointed with this one, I felt I needed to.I ordered the Charge 4 in April, as soon as it came out, to replace my charge 2 that I had had for 2 years and was no longer tracking my heartrate.  I liked the design, LED light, and the way I could see my heartrate, steps and time all on the same screen.  I dont think it ever kept an accurate heart rate during workouts.  My heart rate was noticeably lower then the charge 2 when doing the same workout.I had the Charge 4 for 3 months and the plastic end on the device that holds the band on broke off.  All other Fitbits I have owned had metal tabs holding the band on, Charge 4 they are plastic.  Customer service did finally replace the Charge 4 and band after sending mine in and multiple emails.  Replacement took a little over a month.  It was the middle of September when I got my replacement.  After a week, it stopped tracking anything, but kept the time.  I had to do a factory reset on the Fitbit.  Once I got it going again, it never tracked my floors, but everything else worked so I kept it.  I have had the second one just 2 months, and the plastic tab on the end broke off the same way the first one did.  Please keep in mind, this is normal wear and tear, NOTHING out of the ordinary. I have an office job, so it is not like it is getting banged around.  VERY UNHAPPY.  I would give the Charge 4 negative stars if it was an option.

Overall I liked in inspire HR but as I used it more and more I noticed problems that I don't have with the Charge 4. Let's start by saying I workout 4-5 days a week, usually weights, spin and the occasional general cardio workout, along with this I bike to and from work 5 days a week. For me the heart rate monitor helps figure out where I'm at in my workout and how much more I should push, with the inspire HR, during heavy workout days I'd find when i glanced at it, it would fail to read from time to time, I haven't had this problem since my Charge 4 arrived. The built in gps in the Charge 4 comes in handy but it does drain the battery a bit; On a day when I have a workout, gps turned on for an hour total (to and from work) and throughout the workday----that's about a 16-17 hour day--- it gets down to about 74% battery. It syncs better to the app than the Inspire HR, sometimes I'd have to refresh a half dozen times for the app to find the Inspire but most of the time the Charge 4 syncs immediately or at least after only one refresh. There's additions to the app with the charge 4 including zone minutes, elevation, and a few more badges you can gain. I suppose if you're more athletic and do more outdoor activities the Charge 4's built in gps might be more of a problem than a good thing but for the intermediate fitness person, it's a step up from the Inspire HR.",Syncs better and more accurate than Fitbit Inspire HR,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful

Since I was on a bike I don't know how either of those things were possible. (Though I did do 4 hill climbs which might have been ""counted"" as stairs?)The touch screen was frustrating to use. I would push and swipe forever to get to the exercise I wanted. Set up to start, but then have to repeat that all at the end when I'd already finished (but the clock was still running).  It also would not match the distances to my bike computer which matches my car distances and that's just confusing.While distances are inaccurate it does count steps so if you want to use it as a step counter on your walks that might be the one thing you can do with it.The sleep information seemed interesting and potentially useful but the timeline that shows your sleep is very small and not readable. When you click for info it just gives you the break down in general percentages, as opposed to being able to see what you were doing at each moment of the time line.Also the device sets the bar for ""reward"" very low—one exercise session got all the ""zone minutes"" suggested for the week????? And when I had a bad week of late nights not getting to bed until 1 a.m. I got a higher sleep score and was congratulated on establishing a healthy (????) bedtime.Also the type on all the screens is very small and difficult to read if you need reading glasses but don't always have them on; and the screen is always turning off just when you focus to read it.And the interface with the computer and the iPhone isn't great.

While I haven't had this fitbit long, what little sleep data I've collected appears to underestimate the total length of sleep I'm getting.

I have to say that after about six weeks of use, I've been disappointed.  While the step counting and floor counting got a little better, the  heart rate monitor is still suspect.  The problem with the heart rate might be that I cannot get the Fitbit device to stay two finger widths above my wrist bone without stapling it in place or using duct tape to hold it there.  Does anyone else have this problem?  The most annoying issue I have with this model of Fitbit is that the GPS tracking keeps dropping off in the middle of a run or walk.  It simply loses the GPS signal and stops tracking your progress.  As a result, it does not map your route, gives inaccurate time, pace and distance information and basically makes the GPS feature worthless.  And now the app is about as annoying as the tracker.Shortly after setting up my Fitbit tracker the company pushed a software upgrade to the app that works with it.  Now, every time I open the app I get a prompt asking me to turn on location services.  Well, I had the app set to allow location access only when using, but apparently that's not good enough.  Fitbit wants to track my every movement!  I did allow full access allowed for a short time and after a few days my iPhone prompted me with a message stating that Fitbit was gathering access on where I went even if I wasn't using the app.  Seems like privacy is a foreign concept to this company.Bottom line, find something else that works and won't invade your privacy!",Just another substandard product from Fitbit,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

This fitness tracker is comfortable, has aftermarket straps/bands and works across platforms... on an expendable device, including Apple Watch, the price is much better and is just as accurate. I'm very glad Fitbit came out with the Charge 4 and built off their Charge 3 design... sound familiar... Apple ? Proven design with GPS abilities... good call on Fitbit’s behalf... All my devices are Apple ($3k laptop, $1k+ phone, iPads, iPods, etc)... except my Charge 4. Fitbit is focused on those wanting to target on their overall fitness health... Apple Watch is not the most comfortable ( while not bad)... poor battery life and slightly entertaining... great. Fitbit for daily practical use (I don't like jewelry and this is light weight and hardly noticeable). Apple, well, a big fan, just not of an overpriced watch since both of these devices are expendable. I do like how the Fitbit uses Corning Gorilla glass. It could be brighter in direct sunlight but it’s not a huge bother for me (screen is difficult to see in bright lighting outside).-------------------------------Update:After using the Fitbit Charge 4 for nearly 2 weeks, it has not been accurate. I took it on a few runs and walks using GPS for the auto calibration regarding my stride. I found that the Fitbit is highly inaccurate for the amount of steps taken and distance covered; Side note, GPS distance is accurate... not so much steps taken). Also, sitting at my desk, I can get up to 500 steps in an hour working on my keyboard at the computer with the Charge 4... the Apple Watch doesn't have these issues.My heart rate reported up to 140 BPM on walks, while the Apple Watch maintain around 80-90BPM... the 140BPM is way off. I'm a conditioned athlete and it takes me a minimum of a mile to get my HR up to 140 BPM running (not sprinting). Again, I did calibrate the Fitbit. The Apple Watch as well.What I found was the Fitbit excessively counts steps with arm movements while sitting, which didn't confuse the Apple Watch. However, the Apple Watch will give you standing time when you are not standing... no big deal. However, for my use, the Apple watch is always spot on when I do treadmill runs and providing me general heart rate feedback.While I don't get all the data/metrics that that Fitbit has to offer that the Apple Watch has, I just don't trust it. I tested it against multiple devices and the Fitbit usually seems more than generous to give you credit where it isn't earned. Other than the Apple Watch telling me I'm standing on occasion when I'm not, everything else is spot on.I will be missing the sleep feature on the Charge 4 as it seemed to be spot on and VERY impressive. However, I need the device to be accurate for my fitness. I also appreciate that I can look up my info for the Fitbit in a large layout on my web browser while on the Apple Watch I'm mostly stuck to the phone.For me, accuracy was key with my physical activity and the Fitbit Charge 4 did not provide this. I'm kind of bummed about that as I mentioned in my initial review everything I was excited about until reality and daily use set in.My rating is two stars because the device was nearly pointless for my application regarding fitness and accurate measurements (the whole point in purchasing the device) for distance, steps, and heart rate. It has so much potential and the device is VERY comfortable to wear without having to charge it nearly every day. So, I'm back to the Apple Watch for focusing on more realistic fitness goals and metrics. I tried to give the Charge 4 EVERY benefit of a doubt. If your data is not somewhat/fairly accurate, then it doesn't give you much to work with.For now, I'll be sticking to the clunky Apple Watch with poor battery life, no web data, and sleep monitor (there are 3rd parts apps, but Apple Watch isn to practical for sleep use due to short battery life and slow charge time) because my priority is accurately measuring what I previously stated. For that, the Apple Watch excels.---------------------------------------------------Update 2Well, I decided to give the Fitbit Charge 4 another chance. I was able to adjust some settings that made it way more accurate. I wear my watch on my non-dominant arm. However, I put the settings to dominant... now I don't have excessive false steps... actually, it's a little more accurate than the Apple Watch Series 5 I tested it up against. HR is accurate at resting and I have not been able to test this units HR monitor while active... fingers crossed this unit is more accurate than the last.Another bother for me using my Apple Watch is that I'm tied to the phone to observe my data. I appreciate that I can login to my Fitbit account online to look at my metrics/data instead of being tied to the app on a phone.------------July 6, 2020--- Worthy updates released.Fitbit added some pretty cool feature in the most recent update. There is a dynamic GPS update. Basically, when you want to use GPS, it'll default to your phone if you have it on you and then to the device if your phone is unavailable. That was a concern I had because the GPS function does drain the battery quite a bit during my bike rides and most of the time I have my phone with me... good stuff.A ""smart wake"" feature was added as well. Basically, if determines your sleep schedule and the best time to wake you up... probably good for those that don't have a set work schedule... as a student at the moment, it is a hand feature to have to prevent oversleeping, etc.There is now an option to adjust how long the screen stays on for. Good to have... it was getting annoying having to double tap the device every time the screen timed out.Then various bug fixes...---------------Update July 8, 2020I decided to return the Fitbit Charge 4. It is an excellent contender for those focused on fitness. My main gripe was that the Fitbit platform does not readily sync with other apps such as Garmin and Strava. Another considerable issue is that I could not see the screen well outside during runs and biking... and it is difficult to start stop/activities outdoors with sweaty hands (no physical buttons (more competitive than physical press) other than the one on the side). Since I use an Edge for my road bike, I decided to get a Garmin watch (Instinct) considering it readily syncs with Strava, Garmin Connect and my cycling computer. My main glaring issues were screen readability outdoors and app syncing. If not for these issues, I'd likely been more than happy with the Charge 4. For the price, I definitely recommend it for those if this is the only platform they depend on to track their health and fitness.Sleep tracking is really good as well as the step count once you get everything honed in.","Returning the Charge 4, Apple Watch is Significantly more accurate...

The battery life was only a day! Customer Support was zero help with that issue. Moving on! I bought the Charge 4 even though the reviews were sketchy about it working. Mine does work perfectly fine! I had zero issues setting it up right out of the box. When you take it out of the box try and download the fitbit app and opening that before you play with the watch. It will immediately want to look for your fitbit once you select the one you have.My concern: I don't feel the step count is accurate. My Versa 2 (which was a shame) worked well with the step count. I could walk and count the steps and the Versa 2 would have that same step count. My Charge 4 does not do that. It is giving me credit for a couple steps every 20 steps, lol. Maybe it's just really strict? I don't know if others are having this issue.For example, I went for a 10 mile run and it gave me credit for 6k steps! It should have bee closer to 20k or more. All other functions work great. The battery life is FANTASTIC! It does last up to 7 days. If you use GPS, you will only get a few hours. So for my endurance runners out there, the GPS feature is not going to get you through your long distance runs.I do recommend the product and maybe with the updates coming out the step counter will work better.

I live in a flat area in a 1-story home yet somehow the Fitbit is tracking me climbing 18-50 floors a day? During weeks where I'm literally just sitting at home working from my desk? It doesn't make sense and there doesn't appear to be any ""fix"" as you can't delete floors so now I'm just stuck with the app telling me I burned a couple extra hundred calories that I didn't actually burn. It's ruining any useful data.Fitbit support is pretty useless too.

I bought this to replace my series 2 Apple Watch so that I could track my sleep. The Charge 4 advertises a week battery life, but I don’t think mine lasts more than a few days without needing recharging. I tracked a 7.7 mile hike today, but it only recorded it as 3.6 miles. It also went from 95% battery to 6% in about 3 hours of tracking. I tried to edit the distance in the app but it would not save the change. Then it stopped showing the option to edit it.Overall the sleep tracking is good, but you have to pay for their premium subscription to get full data, which is stupid. The app sucks and often has bugs and fails to sync.Also, this won’t natively sync with Apple health and the third party apps don’t completely work either.

All of the useful features have been removed from the app.  I used to set up and activate multiple timers through the app and now you have to do it through the charge 4, which is incredibly difficult to do.  The charge 4 does not display upon the movement of my arm to view it as the charge 2 did.  On very rare occasions it will wake and actually display but that is less than 10% of the time.  Pressing the button on the side also will not usually wake the charge 4.  I use this to receive notifications from outlook and they will stay on the device for minutes instead of simply displaying for a few seconds and going away.  Even after you drop your arm and look at the charge 4 minutes later, the same message will still display.  The default setting used to be for steps, now it shows some weird symbol that I have no idea what it is for.  I changed the default clock face to the classic charge 2, but it still defaults to this symbol and you have to tap the charge 4 and hope it will show the number of steps and not do another 'feature' that has been added.  This is after having to wait 5 days to receive the update pushed to the phone by Fitbit.  I cannot recommend this device and would strongly suggest buying any other device to help track your fitness.  The charge 2 was an acceptable device that should have been improved upon (believe me, it needed improvements also), but the charge 4 is quite a few steps backwards from what the charge 2 was.UPDATE:  One month after use, had issue with the screen not displaying.  Haptic responses were being felt when holding the power ""button"" in.  Restarted it multiple times, would see an ironic smiley face and then nothing.  The solution was to reattach it to bluetooth, which took many tries until I finally slammed it down on the floor three times and after that it would attach through the app and bluetooth and began working again.  PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND BUY ANOTHER TRACKER.  I DO NOT HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR YOU, JUST NOT THIS ONE.  If you have 45 minutes to spend trying to get the fitbit to start working every few weeks and pray that it does, then this device is for you.  The last day I could return this was yesterday and I wish it would have pulled this no display then and I would have started the return.UPDATE #2:  Once again, this device started showing only a smiley face this morning.  Took me 45 minutes of trying to turn it off and back on, having to get bluetooth working on it to find it again and then after I finally got it setup, it wanted to update itself.  I guess that if Fitbit's way of making you update the device and spending 45 minutes screwing around with this POS and that does not stand for Point of Sale.  I am not one of those paid plebs that got this for free to leave a 5 star review, I paid $150 for this junk and the performance so far is crappy.  I can promise you this will be my last fitbit device.  I came from the Charge 2 which was much better and worked most of the time without issues.

I primarily purchased it for the additional sleep features including oxygen and skin temperature monitoring, which is where the problem is. Although it is advertised as having these features, they are not enabled when you get your Charge 4.  These features require a firmware update to work. And there is no way to initiate a firmware update by yourself. You must wait until some time in the future, if ever, that Fitbit decides to push the update to your phone app. Support can’t help with this, and can’t even give you an idea when the update will be offered.It is amazing to me that Fitbit can’t find a way to allow the consumer to initiate the update.  Is their bandwidth really that limited that they can’t handle people updating their firmware when they want so they have to meter it out?The firmware version on my watch is old, with several versions having been released since the one I have but no update to mine even though I continually update the IOS app as is required to get the updates.  It is unclear when, or if, the update needed to enable these features will make it to my watch.It seems more than a little bit like false advertising to state the watch has features that the consumer cannot activate and even the company can’t help via support to enable.If you are purchasing this for these additional features you may want to reconsider. Overall the watch seems to be a quality product, except the stair tracker seems to miss many of my stair climbs that my Blaze accurately recorded.

Often takes a minute or two, and sometimes multiple tries.- GPS rarely works. I run a couple of times a week under open sky, it still fails to connect most of the time, probably less than 1 in 4 attempts. This is probably the biggest issue with this watch.- Watch face is too dim under sunlight. None of the face styles offer pure white while including the health metrics. Some things are always gray colored, which is too dim, and you have to cup your hand over the watch to read them.  Run timer is also unreadable under sunlight, so it's nearly impossible to check your time while you're running- Screen will occasionally freeze. Only way to fix seems to be connecting it to the power cord.- Sticks out from your wrist more than a regular watch, so it's easy to catch on edges.- When tracking steps, it counts extra arm movements as steps (such as washing dishes or other chores) so unless you purely walking/running it's not that accurate over the course of the day.- No swimming option for open water- Water/sweat will sometimes interfere with heart rate monitoring",Ok as a fitness watch,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

NO.... it wasn't, but to be fair, I don't think any of the fitness devices are very accurate.

What follows are my thoughts about it.The most common complaint here seems to be a concern about the battery life.  I have no such complaint.  I simply turn off the functions I don't need or don't use.  Doing so gives me 9 days of battery power if I need it.  I typically charge it once a week.  Usually on Saturary or Sunday while reading or watching TV.  From battery at 15 % to 100% takes about 1 hour.The Good:One of the big reasons why I selected the Charge 4 is its ability to provide ""Contactless Charge Card"" capability.  I load my card information once and that's it.  This is important for me, because as I age, I sometimes leave home without my purse.  And sometimes I have my purse, but I leave my wallet on the dining room table.  I've been caught without my charge card at least six times.  Embarrassing, but no more.The really nice thing about the Charge 4 implementation is that the card number is not stored in the device itself (and what is there is encrypted) so someone with a scanner can't grab my card information.  Activation of the payment function requires that I enter a password/pin while I am wearing the device, making it useless if the device is lost or stolen.Beyond this, it has a very modern, attractive look*It provides a standard selection of useful functions*Most of it's functions can be turned off if you don't need them, allowing conservation of energy by reducing power consumption*Allows selection of watch faces to satisfy your particular taste*Easy on/off bands if you want to change the look.The Bad:Switching between functions can be frustrating, because there is no ability to tailor the position of the icons needed to switch between functions.  Also, the icons themselves do not provide an intuitive idea of what function they provide access to.Another thing I find disconcerting it that the step count always seems wrong.  The software trys to include an allowance for changes in altitude, but this confuses the hell out of users who expect a simple calculation.  Instead I see weird values that don't match my stride length over a known, measured course having a mix of flat, downhill, and uphill terrain.The Ugly:The contactless payment Password/pin is not long enough to provide proper security. It also fails to give me a sufficient number of characters to select from.  A modification is needed to allow me as the owner to control how many and which characters I want to use to secure my device.",Great Value For The Price But Could Be Better,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

However, it has so many flaws that's is basically useless to me. First problem is battery life using GPS is about 2 hours and then it has to be charged before another workout. To compensate for the battery life fitbit updated and made it so if you're carrying your phone it would use your phones GPS which is just ridiculous since the selling point of this newer device is BUILT IN GPS! Second problem is even when using the GPS on my Charge 4 and having my phone the GPS drops out totally randomly. So again, back to square one of miles of workout just not being tracked.

Shouldn't be this hard.Also the previous Fitbit I had (lower model Charge), before every exercise I just had to push the side button. Here? I have to search through the exercises I want to do, it takes up a lot of time.

The response from Fitbit on the sites was that temperature change, wind, closing a car door, the moon in Venus' quadrant, pretty much anything can cause the Fitbit to count mythical stairs, perhaps several hundred a day. I didn't like the Charge so much that I was willing to accept this large flaw. It was also annoying that it likes to hide data, like minute to minute heartrate and the oxygen saturation.

I was excited to replace it with the Charge 4. Minimalist appearance and improved functionality all seemed wonderful. The I got it. This thing is terrible in so many ways. I have owned it for over 12 months now, so this is a fully educated review. The most frustrating are the following:* It almost never auto-syncs. The sync can take forever and often gets stuck. I have had a full week go by where I could not get the Fitbit Charge 4 to sync to my app.* The number of actions you need to take to get to a function is awful. For the last activity in my list, I need to perform 7 actions to start recording exercise - SEVEN! And many times, it does not start recording, so I get done with my workout, and it is still on a set up screen.* It does not stop recording a workout session when you plug it in to charge it. My previous unit would stop recording. This new unit, you need to perform another 4 actions to stop recording. That is 11 actions (swipes or clicks) to start and stop recording of exercise.* I have yet (over a year of ownership) to have this thing start auto-recording exercise. This was one of the functionalities I was very excited about. Never worked.Super disappointed in this offering from Fitbit. Pick another unit or another company. Finicky, flawed, and cumbersome processes aside, it does function as fitness and sleep tracker - you'll just never see your data in real time because the sync will never work right.","Finicky, flawed, cumbersome (owned for 12 months)",Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Neither can be seen in daylight at 40 degrees North, and normal only dimly in overcast daylight.  Other functions are also too dim to see except in the woods when I go for a walk in the State Park.I use the analog display, so maybe I could see the digital.  When I set up on a phone as Customer Service instructed, there were several to choose fromon the tracker, including a large digital display.  But since setup there are none else on the tracker but the anaqlog.  The web site says they are only available via phone app.  Other trackers have multiple clock faces on them all the time (see Do-Smarter comparison, below).I have a W7 Computer and no cell phone.  The Fitbit communicates with the PC by the Fitbit dongle, and I think by bluetooth dongle.  I have both.  I had downloaded the W8 app for earlier Fitbit models onto my W7 PC, and Customer service told me to set up with someone’s phone and the app would work.  I did and it did, recognizing  my tracker, setting the clock, and linking me to the online dash board via my browser.Since then, I had let the battery run down, and since that, the PC app no longer recognizes the tracker, though when I click the “Check for device update” link (A new feature, I think), and log in, the Charge 4 shows up, doubtless because my tracker is registered and I had set up once, but the app asks for it.  The dashboard is accessible directly on the web site, but it does not sync with the tracker and data input is difficult.Only the clock has been affected by the run-down battery, behind by about 50 minutes.  The tracker remembers everything that had been put into it including activtion/setup date.  So I do not know whether the non- recognition is due to the battery run down, or because Google has taken over Fitbit, or because they have decided not to support Windows below10 any more for some other reason.In any case,  it is clear that one way or another, Fitbit has become hostile to Windows.  I will find another willing helper and set up again to see whether the app will work.In the community help, people had been concerned about the Google take- over and were assured by the company people that it would not affect service and apps, but several people complained that their PC apps no longer worked.  Community help is no longer on the web site, and what is described as available on a phone sounds like feel- good messaging and discussions of exercise, as available from the dashboard.I went online to customer service to discuss matters.  They vehemently denied that any Fitbit tracker works with any Windows device, even when I sent them the entire dialogue in which I was told how to make the W8 PC app work with W7, and the W8 app and W10 phone app were (Are still?) on the MS web site for download as so described on the Fitbit PC app page, which they also denied vehemently.And indeed, there is yet an app for W10 PC’s as well as W10 Phones on the Fitbit site, but the lower number Windows apps I cannot find.Meanwhile, I use the functions that do not need a phone or the dashboard, for basic data collection, and I mentally adjust the time.DO-SMARTERAlso, I have since bought another tracker, by Do-Smarter https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08C78B5J5 (All the URL needed.  More might contain account data).  I think it is better and it is much cheaper.  I will compare features:So far the Do-Smarter  battery lasts more than four days with the display set at 3/4 on a sliding control.  I put it on the charger on the fourth night when the little oval with four lines shows 1/4 charge.Both trackers have proved themselves watertight for running liquid water and doing dishes.  It is Summer so I have yet to test them under a wet sleeve, the worst condition -- vapor and damp.  Do-smarter claims, “Sweat resistant.""Do-Smarter has no app for PC, so I still have to mentally adjust the time, but the tracker has four clock faces and more non- phone functions and can be read in full daylight on a color display, including blood pressure, walk, run, and cycling as indoor and outdoor.  There are more function settings on the Do-Smarter, too.The sleep monitor is on the tracker, recording light and deep sleep automatically -- no preset time, but it does not add more if you awaken briefly and return to sleep.  The sleep monitor is only available on the phone app for the Fitbit, but with more extensive data as might have the Do-Smarter app.  I don't know.Unfortunately, the Do-Smarter does not have a continuous pulse read- out like the Fitbit, but it vibrates and displays an alert when things are not “Normal.”  Someone with a pulse- rate problem might not find that adequate, but Do-Smarter has other trackers that might do better.  I don’t have such a problem, so this one is OK for me.I walk.  The Fitbit dashboard online has no pace length input, but maybe the one called up by the PC app does and maybe the phone app does and maybe the Do-smarter phone app does.  Both the Do-Smarter ""Indoor Walk,"" and the Fitbit ""Walk,"" use a default full cycle pace (left-right) of about 2 feet/ 0.7 meters calculating steps into distance.  On the Fitbit, distance is calculated to 0.01 mile (Unit set on registration?) and the Do-smarter to 0.1 kilometer.  The steps are counted from the swing of the arms, on both.  Neither tracker counts them all.  But I have a fidgety hand that can travel very far in any case.There is no ""Help"" available on the Do-Smarter website, and no community, but I have been in touch with do-Smarter Customer Service by email (Address highlighted on web site).  I made suggestions and asked a question.  They replied promptly, thanked me, answered the question and told me that a tracker that does not need a phone is in development.  I await eagerly.","Battery gone weak Invisible in daylight One clock face Customer service surly Community, apps, gone",Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I liked how it worked for the most part but accuracy was way off (workouts would undercount steps but I could ride the mower for 45 mins and get 2 days worth of steps).  My wife talked me into upgrading to an actual fitbit.  After reading reviews and product descriptions and pouring over videos I had narrowed it down to the charge 4, the charge 3, and a Samsung offering.  Well the price tag on the Samsung put it out, and the charge 3 is selling for as much as a 4.  After a very frustrating wait on a prime shipment (7 days when it should have been 2) the watch arrived.  First and foremost there are NO directions so forget about learning any of the features by reading (whatever).  The app is somewhat complicated and very difficult to figure out.  After several hours of frustrating and useless attempts I finally have up and packed it all up to be sent back (mind you my battery went from 72% to 14%).  The next day I wore the watch to spite myself and it did record my steps accurately.  I played with it more that night and got some of the features to work but I still could not get my texts.  My daughter took over and figured out what I was doing wrong (had the do not disturb turned on at the watch- but not in the app) which brings me to my next huge issue.  Some of the features can only be accessed from the watch, some only from the app, and some from either.  SO frustrating.  So after getting everything FINALLY set up I wore the watch all day and night.  Everything worked and I got a sleep score and all was good.  3 days later and some of the features have stopped working.  Sleep score no longer records (but it tells me how much I sleep and all the jazz).  Workout target zone does not work now (I must have turned off something that records this info).  I can't seem to answer my texts thru the watch at all.  To activate the screen is a practice of futility.  Some times 2 or 3 taps will turn on the screen and sometimes I have to tap the screen 50 to 100 times, and sometimes the only way to activate the screen is with the button (I do have a cover on mine but still).  There are some really nice things about the watch.  Switch bands is a breeze and takes less than a minute, and the bands hold well.  Most texts are easy to read and I have not run out of space on longer texts (my last watch was limited to 2 screens and 2 words).  Battery life has been excellent (4 days of messing around with settings and what not and still at 48%).  Bluetooth range is amazing (15 feet in a lot of cases).  Step count is super accurate (often within 20 steps of my wife's watch when we do workouts together).  There are some cool faces and apps you can add to the watch.  Overall I'm feeling pretty neutral on Fitbit in general.  There is a lot of info provided but the app is so unfriendly and hard to figure out.  There is to much fiddling around between the watch and the app as to be frustrating.  Even the ""How to Use"" section on the app is worthless (it tells you features, but not how to turn them on or off).  I am keeping the watch because it does track what I want, but would not recommend it to anyone new to tracker apps as trying to learn this app is way to complicated.",Torn on this,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

But for some unknown reason, the FitBit requires that you keep location on 100% of the time to sync the watch with the app - even after the device is already paired. As someone who has always preferred to keep location off when I don't explicitly need it, this is very very annoying.Second, the app gets stuck after you go for an exercise session that uses the watch's own GPS. And it puts up an un-clearable notification that the watch's GPS is running even after it has stopped; only way to clear it is to reboot the phone. (Either that or the watch's GPS isn't actually stopping when you end your exercise. Either way, extremely annoying.)Third, the battery life isn't as good as I was hoping. The health watch I bought over 2 years ago, was smaller, had the same features, and still had better battery life. The charging cord that comes with it is also very short.Finally, the app and connections just don't work as easily as they should. For example, it doesn't actually feed your step count into the Google Fit app. And getting everything setup isn't quite as easy as it should be. It's not able to communicate directly with other apps that you have on your phone. Instead you need to go give your accounts permissions to share data via the web. Understandable in some ways, but still less than totally user-friendly.On the good side, the watch/band seem well-made. It seems like it is pretty accurate in the measures that it takes. And the app gives you a lot of tools to monitor or improve your health.",Decent watch with some annoyances,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

So far I'm very happy with it and all my actual exercises seem to be tracked accurately.Every once in a while the pulse monitor will display double what my actual pulse is.  For instance I was watching TV one morning and I felt a buzz on my wrist from the Charge 4.  I glanced at it and it showed my heart rate at 128 bpm and that I was in the cardio zone.  I took my pulse manually with my fingers and a clock and it was actually 64 bpm.  I moved the tracker higher and lower on my wrist and even put it on the bottom side but it stayed double my actual pulse for several minutes.  Then it went back to normal.  Sometimes it will do it when I'm at work and other times when I'm driving.  It's only once a week at the most and only for maybe 5 or 6 minutes at a time.  I took one star off the accuracy for that since it screws up my active minutes and calories burned in the app.Other than the pulse thing, the GPS and step counter are very accurate when I compared them to actually counting my steps while doing laps on a high school running track.The battery charge lasts more than 4 days (I charge it on Mondays and Fridays when I first get to work) and it's at about 35-40% on Fridays. I could probably get another day out of it but I'm sitting at my desk doing nothing so it's a good time to charge it.  It charges up in around an hour.My wife now has my Inspire 2 and it works well for her.  She does most of her cardio workouts on an elliptical machine so doesn't need a built in GPS function.The FitBit Charge 4 is a good little unit and I'm happy with my purchase.","Great fitness tracker, heart rate sometimes funky",Color: Black/Granite ReflectiveEdition: Special EditionVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

I contacted support and was told it was bc the GPS signal had been lost. So- I adjusted my GPS settings, I rebooted my device (multiple times bc it is basically the only advise support had every time I contacted them), I read through the Charge 4 support forums where many other people are struggling with their watch suddenly stopping when they are in exercise mode due to the GPS failure. Neither my Ionic nor my phone ever had a problem losing GPS signal in the areas that Charge 4 did. It wouldn't be so bad if the watch warned you by buzzing or something when it shut down the exercise tracking mode, but it doesn't.

The first was an Ionic model, which was replaced under warranty because it had problems charging.  The replacement ended up having the same problems withing a few weeks of light use.I've since purchased this model and straight out of the box I'm a bit disappointed.  Fitbit has incorporated a clip on charging cord which should be an improvement of the last one. Unfortunately the charging cord is short, at most a few inches more than one foot. Since the cord isn't long enough to reach from any standard height US outlet to any common piece of furniture I'm looking at purchasing a longer cord.Secondly, the last model had large and small bands that were two pieces. For this model Fitbit included an extra receiving end that is longer than the other.  I was rather disappointed that they aren't actually large and small but rather long and short.Having purchased two (one is for my wife) I anticipate buying two new cords and at least one band.  I don't expect to pay more than $30 for these items, but I do feel a bit ripped off.  I few extra pennies in materials could have provided buyers with decent bands and a useful charging cord.I also find the useless cord to be wasteful.

We are also old enough to remember B&W TV's, no remote controls, one phone in the house and plastic's were just becoming popular and beginning it's scourge on our planet we enjoy today.  I slapped on her old Fitbit 2 from her when she upgraded to whatever she wears now, in the Covid Spring of 2020.  I wanted to track my sleep.  It kind of stuck on my wrist since then.  The Charge 4 which arrived last week or so has so many different items on it, I don't know what to do with stuff.  If you need all of that, then go for it.  It's a bit of overkill for me at this point, I am wondering what may be arriving next in her crusade to make me have a body like Brad Pitt.  If that Mirror thing shows up, I'm out of here.  Anyway, don't link the fitbit to your Lose It app if you have one since it will credit you calories which have to be completely out of whack.  Seriously.. averaging something like 2000 or so steps and earning exercise badges when walking from my living room to home office, to kitchen and finally to bed in a 1700 Sq Ft home cannot be accurate.

It didn’t seem like it was tracking accurately. Until my personal trainer told me that I need to wear it on the inside of my wrist. Ever since I changed it, it works great! I will warn any buyers that if you have lots of freckles or tattoos heavily on the wrist you plan to wear it on then consider wearing the fit bit on the inside of your wrist. It’s very accurate! My most favorite feature is that it shows me the total calories I burn everyday which helps me with making sure my food intake remains at a calorie deficit. I also love that I can wear it to my HIIT class and my intense aqua workouts in the pool. It tracks better/more accurate than my Apple Watch in the pool, outside of the pool, my steps, my heart rate during a workout, and calories burned. My Apple Watch tends to have a higher number but then again it wasn’t built solely for fitness. The Fitbit was. I truly only bought the fitbit because I wanted to see how many calories I burn each day and because my personal trainer told me it would help me tremendously. She was right! I’ve lost 16lbs since I got it. I work very hard to keep a calorie deficit. The Fitbit is very accurate and the total number of calories burned is the best feature. I will also add that I’ve just started using the sleep tracking . The sleep tracking feature has been very informative. I never thought I needed to track it before but then decided to give it a try. It broke down my sleep by tracking my heart rate and oxygen levels in my blood and movement... it showed me my deep sleep, REM, and light sleep. And it scores my quality of sleep. It’s quite fascinating! I now wear it all the time. Which brings me to the battery. They recently had an update a month ago and I found since then that the battery life has greatly increased. I can wear the Fitbit for 3 days before charging it. And when I need to charge it- it takes very little time to charge it.  All in all, I would recommend buying this if you are serious about losing weight and/or tracking your fitness and steps.",Personal opinion of Fitbit and Apple Watch,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

The Garmen calculated the correct distance at 4 miles (accurate distance based on the topo map). The Fitbit said is was 5.49 miles outbound (12,869 steps with short strides) and 5.12 miles on return (11,442 steps with longer strides). The GPS was on, as evidence by being able to see my route in the app after synching. I suspect the Fitbit always uses step count multiplied by assumed stride to calculate distance. My outbound stride was shorter (pack was heavier) and so the determined distance was longer. It's pretty sad the return distance was so far off because it's not very useful if using it for understand location relative to distance left-to-go on return trip.Why doesn't the Fitbit use the GPS data? Do a search for ""Fitbit distance not accurate"" and you'll find lots of complaints about this. It is a common problem  with many frustrated users.I think the distance for bike exercise (while GPS on) is more accurate, but not sure as have not used it on same route more than once. It at least seems closer than the random 25% over-estimate that it had on our hike.To summarize, it's a fun toy if you want to track your heart rate or exercise duration, but if you want accurate distance walked or run for a serious data, then get something else.",Not accurate for distance tracking while walking,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I’ve had it about a month, if I remember correctly. It tracks steps and flights of stairs with about the same accuracy as the Charge 2 - which kind of disappoints me. I get steps for washing/drying my hands, brushing my teeth, labeling post cards with address labels at work, and sometimes even when I’m sleeping. However, when I’m carrying something while walking and can’t swing my arms, it does not count the steps. This is the 21st Century... maybe I’m off base, but I expect better technology.I have tracked many outdoor walks with it and I do Refit Dance Fitness every week. If you turn on the tracking either in the app or on the device itself, it seems to track very well. If you wait for it to auto-recognize that you’re exercising, you’re going to lose a good 10-15 minutes of your workout before it starts. (LAME!)The band is comfortable. Maybe it’s just mine, but it seems like the band does not fit to the device very snugly, like it wants to pull away from the tracker (I am using the original band that came with the device). I’m not sure if that effects the accuracy of the counting.It’s easy to use. You can customize the display pretty easily, lots of different options there.Battery life...depends on how you use it. If you use the watch’s GPS or have it use your phone’s GPS while tracking on the actual watch and not in the app, the battery drains FAST. I have always used the app to track exercises that would use GPS, so I get a week out of the battery. I do not use the Spotify feature, since I don’t have an account, and I do not get text/email/other app notifications sent to the watch (that’s not why I bought a fitness tracker), so I don’t know how those functions would effect battery life. I try to charge it when it gets down to 20-25% battery. It charges up to 99% in about an hour. I’ve left it on the charger for up to an hour and twenty minutes and have never gotten it past 99% charged.So it gets 4/5 stars - When you wrap your head around the fact that it’s not going to be completely accurate, but give you a general picture of your steps and calories burned throughout the day, it’s a good watch.","Disappointed in a few things, but overall pleased.",Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Every single other time it was not even close. I knew exactly how I was wearing the watch and where it was on my wrist but I could never get it to keep an accurate reading again for an entire workout, so it was clearly just a fluke.It does state it will be inaccurate when you're doing things like weights due to the motion of your wrists - however it doesn't even work properly when you're  wrists aren't moving. I tested this every single day on the treadmill where I was able to hold my hands/wrists in very specific positions to ensure I'd be able to find a position where it could properly track my heart rate. But it was simply not possible. It would briefly show my heart rate around 155 (accurate) and then immediately drop back down to around 80 even though I was doing everything humanly possible to get a steady reading.No matter how tight or how loose, which wrist, facing in or out, how high up or low down,  absolutely nothing worked. After 27 days of ending every type walking/hiit/weights working completely frustrated with this machine telling me I was in in resting heart rate range for 60-80% of my HARD workouts, I realized this was doing more harm than good. It was making me view all my workouts negatively and made me want to workout less. Isn't that the exact opposite of what you want your activity tracker to do? I came to my senses eventually and returned it.If you do a search for ""heart rate"" in the reviews, you'll see literally every person who mentioned it gave it a bad review so it's not just me. I did this search on several other brands of HR wrist monitors and unfortunately they all seem to have the same problems. So the technology just isn't there yet. Need to stick to a chest strap if you truly want to know.If you can't trust the heart rate sensor then you really can't trust all the sleep monitoring and blood oxygen etc. The step counter itself seems to work quite well. The GPS worked for my outdoor walks. The app is very well laid out and easy to use. It tells you the accurate time. But in my opinion this is very overpriced if it doesn't work for the rest of the functions.I have a bony wrist and this left me a nice, long lasting bruise after awhile. Not caused by wearing it during the day, but I sleep on my side at night and the hard back of the watch would get pressed hard against my wrist and I had this bruise from about 10 days in until the day I returned it. I wouldn't have minded the bruise if it actually worked!Overall, if you're looking for something to help motivate you and track how hard you're working during workouts, I absolutely would NOT recommend this.

Luckily, I can use a “retro” screen option to have the same screen as my Charge 2, but using this screen breaks all kinds of functionality because it is essentially an overlay to the built-in screens. Plus, since the Charge 4 is a touchscreen, it’s literally NEVER on the first page of the retro screen, so I have to tap once or twice to cycle through the retro screen pages to get to the main page which shows the time/date/steps/heart rate• Because of the retro screen, it’s difficult/impossible to see remaining battery percentage or remaining steps to complete the 250/hour activity bar.• The touchscreen itself is the cause of a plethora of my complaints. When notifications arrive, pressing the button on the side just snoozes them. You have to swipe down and clear them later. And they have a habit of popping back up randomly later, or not showing when you go to clear the screen, but popping up later. This behavior has caused me to accidentally call people, because an old notification pops up and the touchscreen gets bumped somehow, and next thing I know there’s an active call on my phone.The touchscreen is also constantly opening apps from the submenus randomly when it gets bumped.• You can’t reorder the apps that display on the touchscreen pages. You can only add/subtract apps.• Automatic sleep tracking is still very hit/miss. I had hoped that upgrading to the newer device would resolve that.• Notifications stop working on a frequent basis, requiring me to remove the Charge 4 from Bluetooth and the FitBit app and add it again.• Syncing often doesn’t fully complete and I have to try to manually force a full sync.Overall, I was happier with my Charge 2, however:• I do like the ease of changing bands on the Charge 4.• I also like the SpO2 monitoring, when it works.

It quickly began to show its flaws within a few months though.  The first is the inaccuracy of its heart rate monitor.  There have been so many times my heart is pounding while working out my legs and the Fitbit shows my heart rate to be 60-70 bpm.  The other issue with the heart rate monitor is that it stops sensing my heart rate if my wrist gets sweaty.  I find myself having to wipe my wrist and Fitbit frequently so I can see a somewhat accurate reading of my heart rate.  The last issue with the heart rate monitor is when I'm out for a brisk walk and it says my heart rate is 165-170 bpm!  I'll check my pulse manually and it'll be more around 110 bpm.I feel like the sleep tracking messed up my sleep.  I wore my Charge 4 to bed for about two months and I had a lot of disrupted sleep over those two months.  I decided the Charge 4 was doing something to me and began removing it before sleeping and what happened?  I slept better again.  My theory is something with the Fitbit's electrical output was messing with me.  When I did wear the Charge 4 to bed, it was nice to see some sleep pattern data, like REM vs. light sleep, etc.Before I finish with my final negative, one positive of the Charge 4: it can last up to 6 days when fully charged.The kicker with this Charge 4 and why I can't recommend it is because it continues Fitbit's tradition of low build quality.  This is my 4th Fitbit since 2015.  The plastic latch that connects the wrist strap to the Charge 4 has already broken. It actually started to become loose only 4 or so months into ownership (see my first pic), and yesterday one latch broke (my second pic - pardon how nasty my Fitbit looks).  Luckily there's a one year warranty on Charge 4s, so I chatted with customer service on the Fitbit website, sent them a picture of my damaged Fitbit, and they've sent me an offer for a replacement.  I'll take them up on the free replacement, but once this next Fitbit breaks (I'll give it 6 months) I'm done with the company.",Poor Build Quality (Again) and Too Many Inaccuracies,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,

My wife has a charge 3 and hers fit snugly on hers AND mine.  Mine are loose on hers.... something is wrong with the wristbands.  I also noticed there is an exceptionally long thread on Fitbit's community site regarding this exact issue, some like mine, and some worse.  Contacting FitBit, I got the response that many on that thread got: ""you have to ship in your device to us, then when we receive it, we'll ship you a replacement.""  Some users reported getting used devices in return.  That ends up being ~10 days turnaround time.  More serious though is that FitBit makes a crap-ton of money by convincing health providers to get employers to use these things, in order to save on health premiums.  They should be CROSS-SHIPPING, at a minimum, or shipping YOU a new device first, so that you don't have down time with no device.Also in the thread were comments that third-party wristbands were better, but no one specified an exact item that I could see, so I ordered at random -- we'll see.

The device worked well. When it failed, I decided to get the latest / greatest FitBit Charge 4.What's to like? It tracks steps.What's not to like?- The watchband fell off - twice in 24 hours. Luckily I was walking on carpet and noticed the device slipping off my arm.- The FittBit Charge 4 packs a lot of features into a watch of relatively the same size as the Charge II. With basically the same screen size, FitBit now puts two features on each screen for many fetures. This basically means that each is half-sized. Not easy to read when 'on the go'.- The navigation of the menus / features is cumbersome at best, and often requires multiple swipes or taps before the device responds.- The physical button has been replaced with a 'touch' area where the button used to be. Again, cumbersome to operate.- The included charger has similar clasping functionality as the Charge 2, however since there is no physical button to align with, getting accurate connectivity for charging becomes a chore, where it used to be intuitive.Switching gears to the ""sync"" functionality; When I first set up the Charge 4, it synced with my phone quickly and easily. After initial setup and reboot, it simply refused to sync with the phone. I powered off, rebooted, in every order I could think of, and even though the phone and watch paired easily each time, sync simply failed each time. The cure? Install the FitBit app on a laptop, then use the laptop to sync the FitBit.  Also very noticeable, my phone is now noticeably MUCH slower and less responsive, and now uses @ 20% more battery each day since installing the FitBit app, even if I never open or look at the app.For me, the Charge 4 does not meet my needs.I will be returning this unit, and have already ordered a Versa 3.

The Charge 4 is generally OK doing these things but with a lot frustrating issues.First, it does not really track steps -- it racks arm movements. So if you move your arms a lot when talking or pet a cat, you get step credit. But if you keep your hands on the grip on a treadmill, elliptical or exercise bike, you get little or no credit for movement. The Health app on my iPhone does a better job in my pocket.Heart rate tracking can also be a problem. I noticed that the Charge 4 showed a heart rate 60bpm LESS than that on my exercise bike. Manually taking my pulse confirmed that the bike was correct. It took the Fitbit almost 20 minutes to be accurate.Using the ""Exercise"" feature on the Charge 4 seems to reduce this problem but there is still a lag. Plus, starting this feature requires you to press the side button, swipe to exercise mode, scroll to the exercise type, tap ""Start"", and tap ""Let's go"" to begin tracking. That's at least one more step than necessary (Start should mean start) and sometimes you miss that last step and nothing is tracked. Stopping is also a little more complicated than necessary.I thought the GPS function would be nice to track all day hikes or moving around a city. The map showing your movements is cool. Unfortunately, using GPS consumes the battery at the rate of about 30% per hour so all-daytracking is not possible.I don't use Spotify but in poking around trying to resolve some of these other issues I found out that the feature on the Charge 4 is only a controller and not a music player. So anyone thinking of using it for music must still carry their phone or other device.Finally, the Fitbit app is both great and THE most frustrating aspect of using this thing. Graphics and information are really nice. BUT, it is very glitchy. Took two chats with support to get it to pair and work properly with my iPhone and iPad. Then, after a firmware update, the Charge 4 was no longer paired with my phone. In fact, the phone could not even see the Fitbit in the Bluetooth menu. It still could be synced on my iPad, so OK.After a second firmware update a few weeks later, my phone asked if I wanted to pair with the Fitbit, which i did. But then it didnt work with the iPad. and the next day it lost the pairing with the phone. Every time I paired it again, it eventually lost the pairing until I restarted the Fitbit. Now it stays paired with the iPad (so far) but is once again invisible to my phone. So we are back where we started after a frustrating few days.I considered sending it back and would have if this last App episode occurred before that window closed. Overall, there are things I really like about the Charge 4 and things I really detest about it. If I had to do it over again, I would have sacrificed the GPS and Spotify -- which are pretty much useless to me anyway -- and gotten the Charge 3. It costs less and might even be less glitchy since its been around awhile.",Too many annoying issues -- Charge 3 would have been a better choice,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

I was looking forward to seeing trends on blood oxygen level and body temperature, but alas, after being on the newest firmware several days, those always show up as no data available.  The description of this device warns that these are ""not available in all markets.""  Since I'm in the urban area of Utah, it seems strange this would be an omitted market!  I can see a LOT of folks are reporting the same problem.  The manual says it has a small hole used to detect altitude, but I haven't found any way to display that.  But my phone will take care of that.Now, what I like:- The interface for setting alarms is now on the watch itself, and easy to use.  I really like that.  On my original HR, this was also easy to do, but it was so complex as to be unusable on the Charge 2.  This was a nice improvement.- I really like the smart wake option on the alarms.  It might not be useful for those with a strict getting up schedule, but for retired folks like me, it makes sure I don't lose any important sleep if wakeup time comes and I'm in the ""deep sleep"" cycle.  In that case it lets me sleep up to an hour extra.  If I'm not in deep sleep, it will wake me up to 30 minutes early.- It's nice that this device is water proof.  I use the hot tub a lot and in the past had to be sure I took my fitbit off first.  Now I don't have to.  I'm also a fisherman, and not as stable as I use to be when younger, so I won't be endangering my fitbit if I step in a deep hole and go under.  I don't even have to take it off when showering, but I do just to keep from having to wipe it dry afterwards.  But if I forget, no big deal.- The band is sturdier than what came on the Charge 2.  It will probably last a lot longer.- At first I was irritated that the charging interface was different than the Charge 2, as I have cables to charge in several places, including my car, and only one came with the Charge 4.  But I found a nifty desktop charger that holds the fitbit in the right position to see the face while it is charging,  It snaps into the new interface securely, and I now appreciate the benefits of the change.- The touch screen, allows easier access to what's on the band without pulling up the app on the phone-  Access to phone text messages is better than on the Charge 2 - a result of a better resolution screenNo Opinion Yet:I haven't dug into the GPS feature yet.  It might be a benefit when I am on one of my summer hikes.  Time will tellAll in all, I'm glad I upgraded.  My several year old Charge 2's screen was getting a bit scratched up so the new one looks a lot better.

The GPS tracking for outdoor runs wasn't perfect, but it did the job, and I wasn't too concerned with extreme accuracy. If you're a runner who needs accuracy from that aspect, I think a Garmin is probably better (my husband has one of those).

It keeps track of ""if you've worked out in a 5 day streak"" but the options are running, treadmill, bike, etc... nothing for hiking, lifting weights, rock climbing, etc.. Those kinds of workout might fall under ""outdoor workout"" which is a setting. It doesn't really matter, since it's still going to track your heart rate, steps and calories burned, but I do find it annoying that there are limited options.One day while I was mowing, it just stopped responding. Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't sync. My husband is in IT and has spent a lot of time figuring out if it can be reset and trying to get it to sync again. Nothing ""happened"" to it. It just failed.

This is also the fanciest. I used one of the OG basic ones years ago simply for step tracking. Upgraded to the Alta HR, which I used for years and mostly loved (great battery life, decent accuracy on step count, tracked my sleep, and FitBit’s crowning glory— the app which is easy to navigate, user friendly and loaded with info, easily the app is the reason I keep staying with FitBit products; I also liked getting my calls and texts scrolling across the screen, that was helpful, the only major con to the Alta HR was how thick the tracker is… can we not get that any thinner/lower profile yet?). Really loved it. But it died. So I went fancier and got this Charge 4. Was supposed to have a seven day battery life, and I barely get half that. And I’m NOT putting this thing through its paces… I don’t record workouts or stream music or anything fancy. I use the same functions I had on the Alta HR— it is used as a watch that tracks my steps and sleep, and I see my texts and call notifications on it (and I’m not getting blown up constantly, I’m in my late 30’s. I could probably count on one or two hands the number of texts I get in a day). I feel like it should be getting at least 5 or 6 days with my very moderate use, and I’m lucky to get 3 or 3.5… I mean, don’t advertise up to 7 days battery life if the only way you get that is to charge it up and then set it by your bed untouched for 7 days. Feels like false advertisement.I also notice that because the band is so wide, if I wash my hands and any water at all gets near it, it gets wet under the band and NEVER DRIES, so it’s a lot of taking it off and trying to dry it on my clothes, because, another downside, I seem to keep getting a rash under the band. Likely from water getting trapped that I don’t get to drying off, but it’s also a weird little red rash right under the heartbeat monitor laser area, so maybe it’s not the trapped water… not sure.Overall, it’s fine. It’s still the Fitbit app I love, and it still is a watch that tracks my steps and sleep and gives me call and text notifications. Just wish they hadn’t misled about battery life, and wish they could get this thing thinner and less bulky. Also, can we please get a universal charger and bands that work on all models???

First, I got it on sale for about$20 less than the current list price.  I like the reminders to move every hour. This can be shut off but I think it helps to not remain desk bound for too long.  I really like the sleep tracking if for no other reason than to remind myself to go to bed on time.  I have some work to do in this area. Step tracking is ok and seems consistent for my normal dog walk routes but random steps get added just by moving my arm.I like that it comes with two band sizes - although I think for me the large has too much extra and the small feels like it could have another notch or two to be perfect.While I like that it has GPS tracking, I don't find it to be all that accurate.  For example, when using the bicycling mode, distances that I know through other tracking such as MapMyRide or my car odometer are just way off through this app (it even randomly stops tracking in portions of my ride).  My mph are off too. It is not easy to pause the activity which is why it seems I've gone much slower than I actually have.  GPS also drains the battery like crazy.  I don't think this feature is a significant advantage over my current MapMyRide app so I probably won't use it much.Speaking of the battery,  I like that it can charge in my usb port on computer ( it doesn't charge when plugged in a wall charger apparently, which I find strange).  And because this Fitbit Charge 4 has made me OCD, it really bugs me that the battery never seems to reach 100% charged.  It stays at 99% forever.

Within just the last 5 days, it has failed in the following ways:1) Step tracking: It has clearly, incorrectly tracked my steps on multiple occasions. In one of the most clear-cut instances, I got out of bed for the first time that day and walked to my bathroom. Once there, it showed that I had walked 63 steps. It takes no more than 10 steps, maximum, to walk to my bathroom.2) Stair tracking: A few days ago, I went for a walk at the park on a trail with very little change in elevation. When I returned home, I walked up to my 2nd floor apartment. When I looked at my workout information, I saw that I had earned a new badge because I had supposedly gone up 29 floors that morning. Even if you counted the steps up to the 1st landing of my apartment as one floor and the stairs the rest of the way up to the 2nd floor as two floors, two is still a loooong way from 29. It also confused going up in an elevator yesterday with going up stairs and there doesn't appear to be any way to manually correct such errors.3) Sleep tracking: I'll admit that it's done an okay, though not perfect, job at tracking my sleep most nights, but it seems like it's getting further and further off the mark with everything recently and my sleep last night is another example of that. It showed that I got 8 hours & 49 minutes of ""Good"" sleep with a score of 83 last night. I wish! I had a terrible attack of acid-reflux induced chest pain last night which woke me up. It forced me to have to attempt to sleep sitting up straight for the remainder of the night and even that didn't stop the pain for much of the night so I was both awake and moving around a great deal of the night. The amount of my sleep and the quality of my sleep were lousy, leaving me exhausted and miserable today, but the Charge 4 disagrees. There is a way to change just my start and end sleep times, which I guess would help a little, but still wouldn't at all reflect my actual sleep last night.I thought myself lucky to have gotten this on sale a little over $100 after tax, but it's not worth that much if the information it's giving me can't be trusted. I'm returning this and just going to try to track my exercise, calories burned, and maybe my sleep with android apps or through other means. I don't expect those to be completely accurate either, but at least I won't be out $100+ for whatever means I end up using.",Inaccurate like the rest,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,

I'm not interested in owning a more fully featured smart watch (Apple, Samsung, FitBit, Garmin).  My company partners with Virgin Pulse for $$ benefits and this was a way to track steps, sleep, etc without being super intrusive.  I must be hard on these devices because I seem to have to replace it every 2 years (thus another reason NOT to buy an expensive smart watch), but I wear this when working in yard, in shop, exercising, and sleeping.The big plus for me was the brightness/clarity of the Charge 4 display which is improved over the Charge 2 and 3 watches.  I definitely get about 6-7 days of charge, but I don't normally let it get below 20% anything.  On to the negative...A minus is that the charger(s) from my Charge 3 don't fit the Charge 4 very well...they are few thousandths of an inch too small.  I can make the chargers work, but they are a little finicky.  I like to keep an extra charger in my truck so I can charge when I'm running errands or going somewhere (and not moving).  I just have to be careful to ensure the watch is actually charging and not bump it.If you want a simple device to track things like steps, exercise, and sleep while not worrying about damages a $500 device, the Charge 4 is recommended.NOTE:  I don't know how accurate the step count or mileage count is...it could be perfect or even off by 5-10% and I wouldn't know or care.

You can use the features or not, depending on how much you want your life tracked by yourself and the Fitbit people. It is a fine tracker. I find the extra features to be pretty ""extra"", but some may want them.However, the thing is pretty big. I'm 5'10, and the watch looks and feels huge on me. I do not feel it is very comfortable to wear, and I don't wear it to bed every night for that reason. Also, I don't need Fitbit to tell me when I slept well or not, I'm pretty much aware of that while I'm tossing and turning. The night oxygen sensor may be helpful if someone has borderline sleep apnea, but I don't know how accurate it is.As other reviewers have mentioned, it's not real responsive when you want to view your stats. You cannot ""tap"" on the front to awaken it.  You have to push the ""button"" on the side (it's more like a sensor). This is mildly annoying.Also the packaging is WAY OVER THE TOP. It comes with a larger band, which one just throws away if not needed. Why not save some plastic and offer 2 sizes? That is a boneheaded corporate decision. The box is way overblown with a plastic insert and lots of gluing and reinforcements. It's also huge compared with what is inside. TOTALLY NOT NECESSARY. It's a exercise tracker. Fitbit, calm down. And reduce your packaging. There's nothing inside the box except the item: you have to go on line to view how to use it anyway.

The only reasons to buy a fitness tracker are:- Step counter- Heart rate monitorThe heart rate monitor is fundamental if you want to maintain your heart in the fat-burning region. This is particularly important if you are interested in doing serious fat loss by going for a walk when your blood is intentionally low on glycogen. However, if you go past a certain range you continue to burn … but most likely you will burn muscle not fat. You want to know that your exercise is aerobic (not anaerobic). I have very low body fat, so I have to be careful with it, I have no intention of burning muscle.Bad news: the heart rate monitor is JUNK, total JUNK, completely erratic. I could go for a walk with 35 degrees Celsius, climbing up a hill for ten or fifteen minutes, without any signal from the heart rate monitor, just the dashes “---”, indicating that the device does not know what is my heart rate at all. This has happened from day one. To goal of the heart rate monitor it to serve as a guideline of whether you are in the aerobic or anaerobic region, such that you can take better decisions to protect yourself. My suspicion is that their heart-rate monitor technology is pretty immature, that simple.Let’s not even mention that their walking-mode menu lacks common sense: too many screens, actually 9-10 of them, with too much unnecessary information and no ability to customize them. Each screen is focused in just one piece of information, say for instance calories burned. In principle, when walking you only need to know:- What is your heart-rate- How many steps you have done- How many calories you have burned- And either: current time and/or time elapsed since you started the walking exercise.Done, is there anything else you need to know? Is it so difficult to create a screen for the walking mode with those four numbers in a single screen menu, such that I don’t have to change back and forth through nine useless screens? It’s not interesting to browse through different screens while you walk or run, it’s just silly poor design and lack of common sense. If I wanted to get distracted flipping screens I would play video games with my phone while trying to walk too. But that’s precisely the reason why you would buy a fitness tracker: to eliminate all the distractions that a phone can give you.As a fitness-focused, no-BS, no-distraction, accurate heart rate monitor it just fails catastrophically. The behavior of the heart rate monitor is plain erratic. In relationship to removing distractions is not really good, the menus of the exercise-mode have too many screens offering a single piece of information, and most of these screens offer information that is not critical in relation to the exercises you are doing. They have failed to provide a device that allows total and absolute focus on what matters.Yes, the steps counter is OK, but there is simply no deal without a serious heart rate monitor. Yes, it has a GPS, it's cute, but it's not critically important or useful, don't get caught by the hipe. In fact the GPS will drain the battery very quickly.",Heart rate monitor is just junk,Color: Black/Granite ReflectiveEdition: Special EditionVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Of course I tried all of their suggestions but none of them cured the problem that both Charge 4's exhibited. I finally decided to cut ties with Fitbit and bought a competitor's product instead, and so far, this competitor's device has been perfect, no problems with auto connecting.For reference, I'm using an Android phone running OS version 11. The problem with auto connecting with the Alta began a few months ago, right around the time there was an OS update (but I can't say for sure it started EXACTLY when the OS was updated). Anyway, assuming the auto connect problem is caused by the latest OS update, then the problem affects at least 2 Fitbit models, the Alta HR and the Charge 4.

I used Premium before as a promotion and don't need it-not impressed. After the Charge 5 became available, I read the 60 Charge 5 reviews on Amazon and the Fitbit forums, and said NO -  I purchased the Charge 4.  I never liked the design on the bands of the Charge 4, they look cheap, but the Special Edition is nice and it came with two band styles.  It arrrived yesterday, and all up and running as supposed to. The screens do scratch so looking for a screen protector.  I hope it lasts at least 3 years.  After that, I don't know what I will do.  I love the Fitbit app, no other like it that  I have been able to see or find.  It seems the merge with Google, their customer service, return policies on amazon, are all substandard for the Charge 5.  I also noticed on the reviews that the features they advertise on the Charge 5 aren't even available yet.  Bad business.  My daughter owned two Versa 2's.  Both lasted just over a year.  Very disappointing as they are expensive.  She ended up getting an Apple watch, but she does miss the Fitbit app (she liked the sleep feature), but loves her new devise.  I do not need everything a smart watch has.  I just wanted a nice tracker, and based on everything that I have read, the company certainly has fallen short on the Charge 5.  One thing I always loved about Fitbit is that their software app was very cool, and ""Free"".  Now with the Charge 5 they force you to buy the premium if you want to utilize the features.Happy with my Charge 4. Easy to figure out after I googled a couple of questions - like how to swap out the bands. The woven band is a difficult to buckle - worth mentioning.  Be careful, they will break if not swapped out properly.  I have noticed even on my past Charge's, that their bands break easily where they snap on, and then I purchase after market bands for much cheaper on Amazon, and they last longer. I do wonder with the failure on the Charge 5 if Fitbit will start charging for the use of their app to make up in sales.",Decided NOT to get the new Charge 5-Happy with the Charge 4,Color: Black/Granite ReflectiveEdition: Special EditionVerified Purchase,

The main reason it was chosen, other than to replace the piece of shirt Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro, was the floor counter, heart rate monitor and the activity features, NONE activity features...in my case:(The app is full of useful information that the Charge ""auto tracks"" and if you wanna make your life busier you can log how much water you drink but ""YOU"" have to add the info.

So it took less than 9 months to become completely brittle to break off as such.As I was chatting with Fitbit to get a replacement, I noticed that in their support page, Fitbit, had a link for ""Bracelet Replacement"" so I told the rep that since Fitbit has a link to get replacements, it MUST BE A KNOWN ISSUE but the rep, as he/she should do, played it safe. Today I went back to get a screenshot but it was removed!It took only a few days, from request to receipt of the band and that's great customer service but it might have been more credible had they sent bands out to all who may have purchased the defective units but YES it is an assumption and I'll take full responsibility...YIKES;)I'd still buy another Fitbit, even in black & white just for the quick CS response and I am really, happy is not a word I use but very content will have to do!!

The other half, for unknown reasons, it simply fails.  Also, it's supposed to do this automatically, and in this regard, it fails completely.  It records data sometimes, but never transfers it.  On the product forum, I learned from other frustrated users that you can get the data transferred if you manually create a sleep record each day, which somehow prods the app software to, oh yeah, go check if there might be some data.  The problems I describe have been going on for a very long time and are all over the product forum.  The company has never responded in any way other than to interject a rare, politely worded RTFM.  Umm, no, everyone has already tried all that.  When it shows up, the data are comprehensive.  However, my intention here was to take a lot of data, and try to identify trends and correlations.

With my old watch I really wanted to be able to like a song while I'm on a run while my phone was tucked away in my fanny pack. Welp, come to find out, I can't do it with this device either. Spotify and Workouts are separate standalone ""apps"" and they cannot run concurrently. So, if I want to map my run with my watch, I can't control Spotify at all.One of the worst parts of FitBit is the companion app. When it works, it is great, but it is full of bugs and often does not work. I will go to log water intake and it does not appear as having been logged for hours. I will log my food and it will add it to the wrong day.Fitbit's engineers have proven themselves to be horrible at their jobs.

Most of the settings were adjusted via your cell phone or computer. Starting the workout mode was easy, just navigate to that screen, hold the button for a few seconds, and it started.

And then, once you get it ready to start, you need to wait for it to lock onto the GPS satellite before you hit the final START button.

It doesn't seem to really do very well with tracking those two activities (there in no dedicated kayaking workout tracker). Other features weren't any better, the sleep tracking and SpO2 monitoring were something I was looking forward to seeing how well they worked. Total disappointment! The sleep tracking seemed incapable of accurately tracking how much I slept always shortchanging by several hours or not indicating any sleep at all. Of the ten days I wore the tracking the SpO2 gave me one day's reading. Seems Fitbit's ability to track these things is quite limited and totally lacks accuracy. Worse yet the last night I was wearing the device I woke up in the middle of the night with a burning sensation on my arm right under where the sensor is located. I immediately took it off and never wore it again after that. However even though I never wore it again I had a phantom sensation of it being on my arm for the next week which has only just now subsided. I truly question the safety of a device that first burn my arm and then leaves a phantom sensation behind for day on end after being removed.",Really excited upon receiving but left with feelings of disappointment as well as safety concerns,Color: Black/BlackEdition: RegularVerified Purchase,

I have had trouble in the past with Fitbit not tracking my heart rate during workouts.  I decided to go all out and buy the charge 4 because of the reviews.  It ended up having the same issues as my previous Fitbit, which was the charge 2, where once I started sweating, it seemed like it just couldn't accurately track my heart rate. If I looked to check where my heart rate was it was either blank or super low.  You can see in the picture I added, it did fine at first but then dropped off even though my workout didn't change. I would compare my heart rate on the treadmill and it was usually way off.  But if I was just sitting or walking it would do just fine. I tried wearing it in different positions and adjusting it's tightness and nothing seemed to help. Once I started sweating it just struggled. I'm disappointed that a 4th generation of this model of Fitbit selling for $140 could still struggle so much.  Not sure if it's because I have hairy arms, or I sweat too much, either way I feel like there really shouldn't be any excuse.

The one time I took this watch on a run I found that the touchscreen controls are unreliable and the GPS is inaccurate. This watch even fails at the most basic function of telling me the time, because those same unreliable controls mean that I usually have to bring my other hand over and tap the screen two to ten times before the screen wakes up.

I like the heart rate monitor and tracking exercise/steps.A few reasons why this device feels like a huge disappointment - enough that I’m going to try to either return it or sell it.1) something changed with the screen or light on this device and you can no longer read it when using polarized sunglasses. WTF? I have it on the brightest setting so it’s not that.2) I absolutely hate the new user interface. It’s difficult to use and not intuitive whatsoever. I hate how you have to swipe across to find things and the touch screen and side touch button is a bad upgrade and finicky. What was wrong with the regular button? I just find myself frustrated everytime i need to track something and often “accidentally” am ending workouts early or they turn off on their own bc someone’s brushed up against it. There are so many stupid pointless screens. How could this design even fly? Did they even test it? Crazy.3) the screen scratched up basically within days of using. I didn’t “do” anything to cause this like falling or impact so I’m guessing it was so minor bump up but now is a giant scratch. These screens should be more resilient.4) why is there no “exercise” function for yoga or really any basic “stationary” exercise like weight training etc? The closes thing is called “outdoor exercise”. Kind of weird.5) the battery feels worse than the prior version.I’m trying to think of a single reason i like this but frankly the charge 2 was leaps and bounds better.

The charge 4 has a long lag for the screen to light up after you turn your wrist to look at it, and then when it finally does come up it is very hard to read while running.  Then half the time it isn't showing the data I want and I have to try to swipe or tap the screen several times and I just end up giving up. It is very awkward to use while exercising.  At this point I'm tempted to go back to running with my phone in my hand instead of my pocket and just using it  again.

I have had the original Moto 360 and I currently have the very old (in electronic years) Huawei watch. I will start off by saying that this Fitbit Charge 4 is way more comfortable than the previous two device. Once on your wrist you will forget that it is there except when it buzzes on your wrist for notifications. Speaking of notifications, they work very nicely without being over bearing. You can choose and select from which apps you want to get notifications on, for example all I care about is notifications from WhatsApp, Messenger and my Emails so that is all I have it set to. You also will get notifications about you activities which you can also change if you feel your getting too many. I left all settings at their defaults and I do not find I get to many notifications. I walk 5 days a weeks and workout 3 days a week and the Charge 4 automatically tracks my walks perfectly. As for my workouts it doesn't seem to know when I am doing pushups or pullups and of course it will not pick up the fact I am doing planks but that is ok as I doubt I am burning a lot of calories from my 3 day a week workouts as it is more for muscle toning and trying to keep a flat stomach in my old age.Sleep tracking on the Charge 4 is very nice!  I have had a sleep study done about 7 years ago and they said I stopped breathing 4 times during the night of the test but that it was not severe enough to warrant a CPAP. This tracker has a SP02 sensor so in the morning I can check to see how many times my blood oxygen dropped low during the night and so far it has only been a couple times over the 17 days since it has started tracking my sleep. So that makes me feel a bit better knowing I really do not have a Sleep Apnea problem. It would be nice if Charge 4 gave you more detailed blood oxygen information, like percentages during the night, but that might something to due with the fact that this is not a medical grade device and they do not want people thinking that or they don't want to have to go through the process of getting certification for it which would cost a lot and effect the cost of the device. Also it does not have OnDemand for SP02 reading, it only checks it at night. It would be nice if they added OnDemand SP02 checking. From reading over on the Fitbit forums it might be added in the future so that would be a big plus, especially for runners.The Charge has 24/7 heart rate monitoring and they use this along with movements to track your sleep and give you a really detailed Sleep Score. It will show you REM, Light, Deep sleep and time awake during the night. From what I can tell it is mostly accurate as it seems to match up perfectly to when I have gotten up to go to the bathroom or let the cat in or out etc. and the REM seems to match up to when I was dreaming the times that I woke from my dreams for what ever reason and checked the time. If I ever do another sleep study it would be neat to check the results verses the Charge 4 but I feel it gives you a very good idea of how your nights sleep was. When my score is high like in the 80s I feel refreshed in the morning but when it was low a few times (73) I felt tired and needed a long nap in the afternoon to recharge. Speaking of naps, it will track your nap so long as it is over 1 hours but will not give you any detailed info about your nap like it does for night time sleeping.Functionality wise, I like how the Charge 4 wakes when you lift you arm. My Huawei watch is hit and miss when I raise my arm but the Charge 4 seems to be about 95% of the time. The touch to wake screen I wish was a bit more sensitive, it works fine after it has been woken from lift to wake but if the Charge 4 has been a sleep for a while and you try and tap to wake I find I have to tap it a few times. This effect me when I am using the Stop Watch feature to time my planks, I can not lift my arm to wake it during planks and trying to tap it to wake it to see if I have hit my time on the Stop Watch can be a pain.Scrolling on the watch is smooth and fast but they need to fix the firmware so that once you leave the main menu, say to go into settings, you can not swipe right to go back, you are forces to press the haptic button to go back which is a pain. I started a Feature Suggestion to get it added over on the Fitbit forum so feel free to up vote it.The display is crisp and bright and easy to read even outside. With my Huawei watch I could not see anything on the screen while outside. The font is large enough that I can see most of the information without my glasses on so that is really nice as I only put them on for reading and of course take them off when I am exercising.About the only I miss from my Huawei watch is music control. You should be able to pause / play and skip tracks of whatever app is playing music on your phone. Not sure why they didn't add this in yet as the Charge 4 is always connected to the phone via Bluetooth so it should be able to do it with a simple firmware update. Even cheap bands out there have this simple feature.The other feature missing but I do not miss is a mic for Google Voice command and a speaker to take calls on your wrist. While it is cool to do this to show off who really want to talk to your wrist to ask Google something or worse to try and have a conversation with someone that everyone around you would be able to listen in on?As far as battery life, they claim 7 days and I am seeing that. I think even 8 days are possible. There is an option to have the screen stay on longer when it wakes but that seems to take a day off the battery life. There is also a Feature Suggestion to add a Always On Display AOD over on the Fitbit forum to the Charge 4 but I think the battery would take too much of a hit if they added it. I think Fitbit did a good job with features and battery life with the Charge 4 as it stands now. Maybe in the Charge 5 with a larger capacity battery they could then add a AOD and maybe a color display that is even bigger but with the current battery technology I think they did a good job with the Charge 4. I like only having to charge mine once a week. Note: I have my Charge 4 set to GPS Mode Dynamic as I have my phone with me when I take my walks. If you leave your phone at home the Charge 4 will automatically use its built in GPS which will drain your battery faster. So keep that in mind if you like to take your walks and runs without taking your phone. One week soon I will try a complete week without taking my phone with me and will update this review with how long the battery lasts so you can get an idea.The other thing I  really like about the Charge 4 over others out there (I was looking at the Garmin Vivoactive 4) is that the band is changeable! As you can see in my photos I have 3 different bands, two came with the Fitbit Charge 4 Special Edition and I purchased the Fitlink Stainless to give it a ""Classy"" look.When you get the Charge 4 it will be on an older version of firmware, which just means it needs to be updated, you can not force it to update and so you have to wait for it to update. Mine took 20 hours to finally say there was an update available. I have read it can take two days. So be patient. I know that this sucks but I think they do it that way as to not drain the battery on the Charge 4. I kept the Fitbit app open and manual synced the Charge 4  (in the app) as often as could while on the charger to get it to show the ""Update Available"" in the app on the phone, so if you are impatient like I am you could give it a try.Well that about wraps up my review of the Fitbit Charge 4 SE. I hope this review helps others out there. I will update the review as I use the Charge 4 more and will adjust the ratings up or down as needed.Note: I was not given this product to evaluate. I paid for it with my own money so my review is not bias in anyway.Updated March 9th 2021, I can see why everyone is leaving Fitbit and heading to anyone else but Fitbit... they have very bad tech support, firmware updates take forever to roll out, and to this date they have not turned on features that they advertise on their very own website. Shame really as I really like the Charge 4 but without support and timely updates to be it is not much use.Update May 13th, They finally got two new firmware updates rolled out and now nightly SP02 average and nightly skin temp variables are working on the C4. Unfortunately there is not many other choices out there in the world at this moment that has all the feature in such a nice small form factor. Believe me I wish there was as Fitbit (Now Google owned) has a lot to be desired as far as support of their products. So if you are looking for something NOW, then yes the C4 is the way to go unless you can wear something bigger on your wrist to bed at night. Let all hope that new wearable tech from other companies get released in the next year to two so that we have better choices to buy. I have raised the star rating to 2.5 (they only let you choose 2 or 3 so subtract 1/2 star from what is showing) :-)","The Good: Comfortable, Accurate, long battery, interchangeable bands!

Others, it thought I had slept 1 or 2 hours. Good lord.I thought maybe it needed updating. I checked and sure enough there was a firmware update. I went through that crappy process and no change.

The watch vibrates whenever I make progress towards a goal such as a number of steps or calories, or when I enter or exit a certain heart rate zone. It also vibrates when it loses GPS, or for a number of other events that I haven't figured out. The vibrations distract me from what I'm doing, and they give me a bit of anxiety because I never know when my wrist will vibrate.

But the Charge 4 has given me so much more than what I wanted. If I’m ever feeling calm, all I have to do is open up the FitBit app and try to sync my FitBit. Soon I will be enraged! Watching the useless progress bar, I constantly ask myself, “what could it possibly be transmitting that takes this long?” Or, “I could learn how to program a better app in the time I’ve waited for this thing to sync.” Eventually, I turned off the auto lock on my phone so I could leave it to sync and not have to watch. This help me find new sources of annoyance when I can’t use my phone and when the battery drains cause I forgot to lock it.The FitBit is constantly innovating new ways to keep me frustrated. For awhile I would go on FitBits site and search for help, and spend my time reading the years of posts about this syncing issue that have gone unresolved. If I need to waste my time, I can follow the simple steps they provide to address the issue, and rediscover that this does not work. I gave up after awhile, but then FitBit added a feature to their app where every time I open it, it asks whether I want to enable enhanced location tracking, and I get to tell it, over and over again, that I do not want to have that level of surveillance. This is another innovation from their basic model, which stores all of your data on their servers without asking you, another effectively annoying thing about it, especially now that they are owned by Google.After having this thing for about a year, FitBit released a firmware update, so I was worried that these annoying features would go away. Luckily, I had nothing to worry about, because the thing repeatedly failed to sync the update. I should have known that they would see that their customers prize the self-flagellation that their product enables.Thank you FitBit, for the hours upon hours of my life that you’ve filled with anger and frustration— a gift that I did not even know to ask for.",Do you like being annoyed?

In the description of this Fitbit, it says that there is an oxygen sensor. However it doesn't give you exact readings, only trends at night. When I first started using it it took several nights to work but after a few nights it stopped working and hasn't worked since at all. When I look for data on even the trend, there is no data and the device says to make sure your Fitbit is up to date and then where to sleep. Well, I have made sure it's up to the date and I have wanted to sleep and still I get no data. I tried troubleshooting with the chat function on the app and hasn't gotten nowhere after two tries with them. Also if you navigate away from the chat you can't get back to it so you have to go in and do another chat again. That's a flaw in the app as well. Overall I'm fairly dissatisfied and I am going to look into sending it back because it's not functioning for much other than counting my steps.

I do. I had a Charge 2 and now have the Charge 4, so I am still surprised that Fitbit still has not figured out how to gage an accurate heart rate. The heart rate monitor can take some 20+ minutes of exercise before it starts gaging accurately and sometimes it just never does. I'm wearing a Polar heart monitor on my chest at the same time. When my heart monitor is measuring 165 bpm (and I know it's accurate), my Fitbit is measuring 90 or so, maybe low 100s. I've tried moving the device to the backside of my wrist, but my heart rate only moved up to the low 120s. The strap cannot be any tighter on my arm.  This wasn't just once. It was again and again. So if the heart rate is off, the calories burned will be off as well. Calories burned on any wearable device is usually off according to multiple studies. A bad heart rate just makes it worse. Not that Google owns Fitbit, I'm hoping this changes on future devices.I do love the sleep tracker and the hydration tracker. The app is great, especially if you are tracking your food, but some of the calorie counts on scanned food items are not accurate and there appears to be no easy way to correct a wrong calories count on food.

I had a Fitbit Blaze before the Charge 4 that did similar things but after about a year or 2 of use. I'm convinced Fitbit puts defective products on the market.

GPS is a little flaky, but the NFC Payment option and the long battery life are nice.

It seems to ""cap"" it's HR monitoring capability to around 160 +/- 10 BPM during my workout.

However even then it has a huge drawback.The watch loses GPS, as all devices do, however with Fitbit some clever person decided that rather than like on most devices where it simply checks again until it finds it this one locks out your activity in such a way that the only way to resume it is to end that activity and start a new completely sperate activity..I ride with people with various different competitors to Fitbit and every time I have to take their submitted activity, I'm not exagerating here, I mean every single time I ride with them, yesterday it this twice to me on the same ride!!!Still don't believe me?
