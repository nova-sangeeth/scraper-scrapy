Do not waste your money on this thermometer. I unfortunately spent $50 on this in late July for the arrival of my youngest as I thought it would be easier to check her forehead than stick our ear thermometer in her tiny ear canals. I have found it odd that it usually reads 97.3 or 97.5 and I don't think has ever read above 98 but haven't had to use it many times. Tonight my 6 month old felt pretty warm as I was putting her to bed so I checked with this thermometer and got a reading of 97.7. My mama instincts told me that this couldn't be right so I went and found our ear thermometer which read 100.6. I am very unhappy that I wasted 50 on this thing and am no longer able to return it or get my money back so I hope this review saves someone from the same misfortune as me.,Do not buy or trust the reading this gives you.,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Last night we took our son to the ER because this thermometer read 104-105 several times in a batch of about ten readings (I think sometimes you get a low reading/normal reading from user error). Once we got to the ER and he got a rectal temp (maybe half hour later), that reading was 105.4. So I feel safe in knowing this thermometer can read the right temp, you just have to take several readings, and whatever the most consistent, highest reading is, is most likely his temp. The reason we were even able to get my son's temp, unlike with our first normal oral thermometer (our second thermometer was a forehead one that just read the same number over and over), is because this one reads in literally a second. You don't even touch his forehead, it vibrates, and you get a reading. Our son struggled with us at first with it, being all curious and wanting to grab at it, but being such a quick and easy way to temp he finally gave in to letting us temp him without obstacle.
