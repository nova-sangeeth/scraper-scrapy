Surgery went textbook except my bone had deformed around the previous knee and much of my tibia (the larger, weight-bearing bone of the leg) broke off with the old knee. much prep work with spacers, new bone matric, etc had to be done before the new knee replacement could be evenly inserted and cemented. My quadriceps muscle was sliced longitudinally to allow access. For the first few days my hospital stay was great I walked, climbed stairs, had over 95 degrees range of motion. But massive localized inflammation set in on the 3rd day and because I have had 2 major stomach surgeries, I cannot swallow NSAIDS anti inflammatory drugs like Alleve, Ibuprofen, Naproxyn, etc., or even aspirin But my knee and legwere swollen to 44”from my normal size of 19-21”. The only medication that workedat all on the extreme painqnd swelling or this inflammatory response was a dangerous IV NSAID called toradol which I couldonly receive for 3 days while in hospital or risk losing my kidney funcion The anesthesiologists had  to administer it. I was sent home with opiod pain pills but nohing for the inflammation. By the next morning my knee was back up to 44”, hot, unable o bend, painful to try usi g my walker or cruzches. In the next few weeks, we tried a trial ofCelebrex,prescription-only diclofenac cream, doubl doses of Curcumin. Nothing helped. The Orthopedic surgeon had no suggestions. My husband, an emergency physician, had no ideas. I became so desperate that I took Alleve orally for 2 days until my gut began bleeding. My sister convinced me to pook at over the counter creams, that there must be one that had found anvehicle to get thir product through the many skin layers which are actually designed to keep these creams out. I agreed that if I found somthing ith at least one major ingredient for whoch there was some science, I would try it Thank the Lord, I found Penetrex cream before I gave up. I knew that oral homeopathic doe s of Arnica worked well on bruises and the pain of broken bones. I knew that oral Botswelia and Oral Glucosamine have shown to provide some relief but this was all in antopical cream. And it is not cheap but I was out of options & really did not believe I would get welluntil I could decrease or eliminate this inflammation. So I ordered the small size& when it arrived, I followedinstructions & massaged the appropriateamount into my knee and surrouding tissues. Smelled good, easy to absorb. Then I went about my reading until about 2 hours later, a strange feeling came over me & I beganchecking for what was wrong. Then it hit me like a hurricane — my knee wasn’t hot, the swelling was reduced and the pain was much lighter. I massaged in some more, and y t again after another 5 hours. when I awoke, I got out of bed without my walker, could actually begin to see my kneecap where once was just a blob and I could walk. At physical therapy later that day, I did the Pilates Teformer was cercises, could pedal the bicycle wheel all the time way over and had range of motion of 123 degrees. I put on more cream cheese hen I got home & more before bed. I slept through the night. Today I was able to repot over a doz n pots of flowers,cook supper, bathe myself, and even started work on a new quilt.Look this could all be coincidental. It could be that my knee is finally beginning to heal on its own. But I personally believe (andI am an epidemiologist married to a board-certified MD) that something  in this cream works on inflammation and lets me live a nearly normal, nearly painfree life just 3 minutes months after q complete knee replacement with partial bone replacement. If you have the money for a small size please try it on your inflammed area. It mike make all the difference in your life like it did in mind. And I will be glad to try and answer any questions",Can’t explain how but it works - please read,Size: 2 OunceVerified Purchase,449 people found this helpful

There are times where my neck is so stiff I cant turn it without being in pain, or my back is so bad I am bent over even walking to the bathroom. My worst is in the morning when I sleep wrong I wake up really sore and my back thrown out. I also have carpel tunnel. I refused surgery because I am too scared to have it done. However, the pain is so intense I wear wrist braces often and have times where my fingers burn so much I can't do anything. I also have times where I pick something up and my hand literally feels like its been power shocked. If you have bad carpel you know what I mean. I was at a loss being in pain with everything I tried everything, heating pads on my back neck and hands, tens units, tons of creams that say they work as well as bio-freeze which I absolutely hate having the smell on me when I go out. I was at the end of my rope when I came across this product. I bought it with little hope it would help and was amazed at what it did. If I wake up with a sore back or neck, I rub this in and it instantly diminishes the pain at least 75 percent. I rubbed it into my hands and wrists and it helped my carpel tunnel at least 40- 50 percent. Hey if I can remove 50 percent of my carpel pain I am all for it. I fell as if it works better on my back and neck and less so on my wrists, however, this is just to let you know how much it helps because I would take being 10 percent better from all the pain I have. So 75 percent on my neck and back and 40-50 percent on my hands is a huge improvement for me. I have already went through 4 jars of this stuff and will continue to keep buying it. I get that it seems expensive, but for what it does its priceless. I also wanted to mention it does not have any burning feeling or any smell when you put it on. I can literally put it on and go to the store without feeling self conscious because of the smell. Highly recommend this product. Please push the helpful button below if I helped your decision.

My dad has had a laryngectomy. Part of the procedure required the surgeon to create a muscle flap where they take muscle tissue from the chest and pull it up inside the body to where the larynx was. This fresh living tissue helps previously radiated tissue to heal. Where the doctors performed the muscle flap part of his surgery, he was really hurting. His whole shoulder was hurting. Plus, my mom has joint pain. She frequently has pain in her knees and sometimes, even though she has had carpal tunnel surgery, she still has pain in her wrists and arms. So I got this for them and guess what? They are rather stubborn and they just couldn't believe that this tiny and unassuming looking little pot of cream  could be any more effective than the over-the-counter stuff they've been using. They didn't use it. It just kind of sat around and I kept reminding them to please give it a try because I had read the reviews on Amazon that your relief will improve with continued use. Plus, this stuff is not exactly cheap for so small an amount either! I wanted them to at least give it a try before they wrote it off. Finally, here it is August of 2018 and my Mom finally decided to give it a try and she is impressed with the results. She started rubbing it on her knees and on her arms and over time she finds that she needs to use it less frequently because the results seem to be cumulative with this stuff.

This makes the product more effective, but also makes it more dangerous for anyone that is even mildly allergic to any of the plant families they include, especially Arnica.  Arnica is technically a poison and for some people (myself included) they will get swollen lymph nodes and pain throughout the body.

He is usually resistant to using any pain creams or ointments, but he actually requests that I rub the Penetrex into his feet when the pain is giving him a fit.What’s more is that I have extremely sensitive skin, but I have had zero adverse reaction to the Penetrex...no rashes, no itching, no redness...just relief. It is worth the price after having wasted plenty of money in other products that either didn’t work or messed up my skin.",Major relief from chronic pain,Size: 2 OunceVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Shortly after applying it I noticed a significant decrease in discomfort and was able to sleep easily. I hadn't really used it since because I'm stubborn and like to save it for really bad days. Every morning when I get out of bed and walk down stairs I take it slow and use the hand rail to help take some weight off my knees. Well last night I woke up to use the bathroom and getting out of bed my knees felt higher than normal discomfort so I slathered some on, worked it in and went back to sleep.

I will sing it's praises from the rooftops!!!  So seriously, if anyone mentions their pain to me, I immediately tell them about Penetrex.  It's been a true lifesaver to me.  I have had mild to severe lower back pain for several years now, that is no longer an issue thanks to this amazing product.  I have arthritis in my fingers/hands, that was getting so bad that I would sit in pain every night, and now it's not an issue at all.  I started using this as per directions and about 4 days in my back was rapidly improving, then my husband mentioned how I wasn't complaining about my hands anymore either.  I never even thought to put it on my hands specifically, it was just a by product of rubbing it in my back.  Amazing!  Everytime I come up with a new ache or pain, I start using and within a short time, I'm fine.  I pulled a muscle and put a crick in my neck after spending an evening face painting kids at a festival, and within two days of rubbing it into my neck, I was fine.  This is an injury that normally takes a week or two to get over for me!We originally bought this product for my husband, an avid runner, who was overcome with serious foot pain.  He was diagnosed with Morton's Neuroma by a doctor and put on three different medications to alleviate his symptoms.  As a teacher, he is on his feet all day, and after 3 weeks of meds and rest (as much as possible) he was not getting much relief at all.  I started researching to see if there was anything else that could help him and found this gem of a product.  After a week of 3 times a day application to his foot, he was off all the meds and walking normally.  It took another week of once or twice a day usage and he was back to running.It is not greasy or smelly or staining in any way.  It, in fact, smells amazing.  I have used it just as a straight up hand lotion at times.  I have tried prescription lidocaine gel, biofreeze, and many other products and this is NOTHING like those other products.  It's as nice as using a high end lotion and getting pain relief to boot.  I will never be without this product again and it will go with me anywhere I go for the rest of my life.

Surgery went textbook except my bone had deformed around the previous knee and much of my tibia (the larger, weight-bearing bone of the leg) broke off with the old knee. much prep work with spacers, new bone matric, etc had to be done before the new knee replacement could be evenly inserted and cemented. My quadriceps muscle was sliced longitudinally to allow access. For the first few days my hospital stay was great I walked, climbed stairs, had over 95 degrees range of motion. But massive localized inflammation set in on the 3rd day and because I have had 2 major stomach surgeries, I cannot swallow NSAIDS anti inflammatory drugs like Alleve, Ibuprofen, Naproxyn, etc., or even aspirin But my knee and legwere swollen to 44”from my normal size of 19-21”. The only medication that workedat all on the extreme painqnd swelling or this inflammatory response was a dangerous IV NSAID called toradol which I couldonly receive for 3 days while in hospital or risk losing my kidney funcion The anesthesiologists had  to administer it. I was sent home with opiod pain pills but nohing for the inflammation. By the next morning my knee was back up to 44”, hot, unable o bend, painful to try usi g my walker or cruzches. In the next few weeks, we tried a trial ofCelebrex,prescription-only diclofenac cream, doubl doses of Curcumin. Nothing helped. The Orthopedic surgeon had no suggestions. My husband, an emergency physician, had no ideas. I became so desperate that I took Alleve orally for 2 days until my gut began bleeding. My sister convinced me to pook at over the counter creams, that there must be one that had found anvehicle to get thir product through the many skin layers which are actually designed to keep these creams out. I agreed that if I found somthing ith at least one major ingredient for whoch there was some science, I would try it Thank the Lord, I found Penetrex cream before I gave up. I knew that oral homeopathic doe s of Arnica worked well on bruises and the pain of broken bones. I knew that oral Botswelia and Oral Glucosamine have shown to provide some relief but this was all in antopical cream. And it is not cheap but I was out of options & really did not believe I would get welluntil I could decrease or eliminate this inflammation. So I ordered the small size& when it arrived, I followedinstructions & massaged the appropriateamount into my knee and surrouding tissues. Smelled good, easy to absorb. Then I went about my reading until about 2 hours later, a strange feeling came over me & I beganchecking for what was wrong. Then it hit me like a hurricane — my knee wasn’t hot, the swelling was reduced and the pain was much lighter. I massaged in some more, and y t again after another 5 hours. when I awoke, I got out of bed without my walker, could actually begin to see my kneecap where once was just a blob and I could walk. At physical therapy later that day, I did the Pilates Teformer was cercises, could pedal the bicycle wheel all the time way over and had range of motion of 123 degrees. I put on more cream cheese hen I got home & more before bed. I slept through the night. Today I was able to repot over a doz n pots of flowers,cook supper, bathe myself, and even started work on a new quilt.Look this could all be coincidental. It could be that my knee is finally beginning to heal on its own. But I personally believe (andI am an epidemiologist married to a board-certified MD) that something  in this cream works on inflammation and lets me live a nearly normal, nearly painfree life just 3 minutes months after q complete knee replacement with partial bone replacement.

I also have times where I pick something up and my hand literally feels like its been power shocked. If you have bad carpel you know what I mean.

I was at the end of my rope when I came across this product. I bought it with little hope it would help and was amazed at what it did. If I wake up with a sore back or neck, I rub this in and it instantly diminishes the pain at least 75 percent. I rubbed it into my hands and wrists and it helped my carpel tunnel at least 40- 50 percent. Hey if I can remove 50 percent of my carpel pain I am all for it. I fell as if it works better on my back and neck and less so on my wrists, however, this is just to let you know how much it helps because I would take being 10 percent better from all the pain I have. So 75 percent on my neck and back and 40-50 percent on my hands is a huge improvement for me. I have already went through 4 jars of this stuff and will continue to keep buying it.

This makes the product more effective, but also makes it more dangerous for anyone that is even mildly allergic to any of the plant families they include, especially Arnica.  Arnica is technically a poison and for some people (myself included) they will get swollen lymph nodes and pain throughout the body.  I spoke with the CEO and asked they make a version that excludes Arnica.  They will not be making another version, sadly.  Otherwise I would give this product a higher rating.

I have cervical  degenerative disk disease, fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. If it is rated good then I buy it.There are a lot of pain cream on the market. Those that give instant relief such as Biofreeze, Icy Hot, etc. And those that provide some instant relief but work better the longer you use it. Examples include Blue Emu and Penetrex which are specifically for inflamation. It helps the nerves too by reducing the inflamation off the nerve. Penetrex and Blue emu are both more natural products that are better to use for a few weeks to see maximum benefits. You do see immediate results, enough to take the edge off but the longer you use It the better they work. This product is not a miracle but it does help. I'm only having to use it 1-2 times a day now instead of every 3-4 hours like when I first started two to three weeks ago. You need to give it time for maximum effects. I can't give the product 5 stars because it's too similar to Blue emu which is cheaper. It's also no miracle cure.. However It does work slightly better then Blue emu and the 4 ounce bottle lasts longer.Another surprising thing is that it does help my severe herniated disks, I'm scheduled for surgery. I was told nothing would help it. In all honesty it just reduces the pain from an 8 to a 6 to take the edge off but that in itself that is fantastic for someone with spinal compression and massive disk issues. It helps my arthritis too. The disks not as much but it does help. Blue emu does about the same though but Penetrex is a tad better but not enough to justify the cost difference in my opinion. $13 vs $36. But I've only been using it for about three weeks and I'm sure the longer you use the better because a few weeks ago I was much more stiff and in a lot more pain then I am now. Blue emu is only $13 for 4 ounces and Penetrex is $37 for 4 ounces. I think Penetrex works slightly better then Blue emu but not much. I do think it's overpriced. I do notice that the container of Penetrex lasts longer then Blue emu just because it's thicker and spreads more so that makes up for some of the price so I can get an extra 10 days approx  out of Penetrex. Blue emu has no smell at all and Penetrex has a vague light peppermint smell.I notice if you severely overuse Penetrex it can make you slightly itchy. I have sensitive skin. By that I mean applying way too much and way too often otherwise there are 0 side effects. I used it today and no itch. Penetrex and Blue emu does not cool the skin like Biofreeze or ICY HOT, it's like using a lotion but it helps which is crazy how it reaches far enough to reduce inflamation. You don't have to worry about strong odors. It's hard to fathom that something that doesn't cool or heat the skin could help but they both DO. I'm not telling you which you should purchase because I feel Penetrex works better then Blue emu but just a little, not a big difference and the cost is steep in comparison although it also lasts longer. I will say that the company Penetrex does give a no questions asked refund if you are not happy you can request an immediate refund so they stand behind there product 100%. If you are in severe pain (stiffness and burning) like I was I highly recommend rotating ICY HOT or BIOFREEZE with either Blue Emu or Penetrex inflamation cream for maximum benefits. I think BIOFREEZE or ICY HOT will take more of the edge off to give the Blue emu or Penetrex time to really kick in. Both do work  immediately but the longer you use It the better and you will notice you don't need it as often. Just as anti inflamitory meds work immediately , they also work better the longer you use them as does both Penetrex and Blue emu.When I first developed the herniation I had not heard of Penetrex. I was using ICY HOT and rotating with Blue Emu to maximize effects. I swore ICY HOT was better then Blue emu, at least somewhat better and cheaper. It took Blue emu time to really start helping, although it helped immediately to take the edge off but not a ton. Each day I noticed more relief. Then Google and Amazon brought me to Penetrex so I wanted to try it as it was the number one best seller. What I do right now is the days I have less pain I do Blue emu and days I have more pain I do Penetrex. When I run out of Penetrex I may stick to just Blue emu. A month ago I was in such bad shape I was using Blue emu and Icy hot in rotation every few hours and that's when I decided to buy Penetrex and started using ALL 3 in rotation. That may seem crazy but when you are in that much pain you will do anything. Now I'm only using Penetrex every few days and Blue emu daily unless I over do it and the pain flares up too much then I use Penetrex.Note: The box says to not use product after too much physical exertion or after hot baths which is confusing. I see that as not happening for me so I broke the rule but I was slightly paranoid. Lol. I take hot epsom salt baths twice a week. I did use this after my bath with no effects outside slight itching/warming feeling on my neck. Blue emu does the same only if I use after a hot bath. Seeing as these do not normally warm or cool on the skin but only happens after a hot bath for me is a little odd. Lol. But I didn't have any crazy side effects. I also use this after cleaning the house and haven't noticed any side effects. Only after my hot baths. A little warm on my neck after applying it which lasts for about 10 minutes..This was definitely the longest review I've ever written but I felt the need to share the difference in these creams and also explain some in how they work different from other creams that cool or heat the skin. The main reason is because I read too many reviews which did not even give the product time to work before saying it's a scam etc. I'm a real buyer and it's not a scam. It's no miracle either but it does help a good 20% of the pain for severe pain and at  least 50%  for mild to moderate pain. I find both Penetrex and Blue emu the best on the market you can buy followed by BIOFREEZE then lastly ICY HOT. My top 3 in order is #1 PENETREX #2. BLUE EMU, #3 BIOFREEZE. #4 ICYHOT. I read Sombra works good too But that's one I've yet to personally try. I think Biofreeze helps the muscles more and Blue emu and Penetrex helps the joints more but they help the muscles too.  It does work immediately to take the edge off but again it takes a few weeks to see a better improvement and the improvement is deserving of 4 stars and if the price was lower it would get 5 stars.. But that's why to start out I recommend rotating with a cooling cream to give this time to see the best results.My mobility is better, stiffness and I can tell the inflamation is down. It helps more then my prescription anti inflammatory.

My husband is a family physician.I have had 54 major surgeries over the past 27 years.I was one of the first people diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 1982,by cutting edge rheumatologists out of Northwestern Memorial Medical Center in Chicago. I then developed Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy three years later after a fall down a flight of stairs 7 months pregnant.and a severe neuropathy in my right foot. Then I developed another rare disease Preisers disease, where your scaphoid bone dies in your wrist. Extremely painful. I then proceeded to fracture my kneecap in 14 pieces. Add in a few spinal cord tumors, a massive foot tumor that left me with an open wound for 7 months this year, osteomyelitis a PICC line and IV antibiotics for 8 weeks this fall. I have had five major foot surgeries this year alone. I am telling you all this to say I have major aches and pains. The neuropathy in my foot is the worst. It feels like pins and needles then a hot poker being inserted all over my foot every few seconds. I have to take such massive doses of neurontin to keep it in check. Well that is causing huge open mouth and tongue sores. My tongue is so swollen I cannot talk. I decided I had nothing to lose by trying this cream. Due to all the bed rest from my foot tumor and subsequent surgeries, my knee is killing me. I also thought maybe it will improve the neuropathy in my foot. i had to wait for my foot to completely close and heal, which it finally did two weeks ago. I have been dealing with this foot issue for over two years. I am extremely pleased to say that after using this for the past two weeks, I am thrilled with the results. It takes about an hour, to relieve the symptoms in my foot, but it does. I have started to reduce the drug giving me mouth sores. It also makes my knee feel better too.

It hardly smells at all and when applied it is more like a cream or lotion rather than a balm or liquid rub. It is quite easy to apply to any sore muscle area and it absorbs rather quickly. I tried three products and compared it to this one. I used Tiger Balm, and Aspercreme.First Tiger Balm is a lot greasier than Penetrex and you have to wash it off after you apply it, or your hands will feel greasy. Penetrex absorbs in and you dont have to wash it off you hands. Tiger Balm rubs in about the same to the skin. But Tiger Balm will give you an immediate feeling of pain numbing versus the Penetrex which can take longer to feel. But the Penetrex does last longer. Tiger Balm also smells and you can definitely tell you are using it. The Penetrex has a very light odor and you have to really sniff to smell it.Aspercreme also rubs in very easily but you do need to wash your hands as well after use. It is more liquidy than Penetrex so it rubs in quicker. It also starts to numb quicker than Penetrex but it goes away a lot faster and does not seem to do as good as the Penetrex or Tiger Balm for pain relief.And so the winner for me is the Penetrex by a very slight margin over the Tiger Balm. What I like about it is that while it does not have an overwhelming sense of numbing, it does numb the pain and for a lot longer than the others. It rubs in very easily and dries out so you dont have to wash your hands and it doesnt leave an unpleasant odor. It still does not do much for chronic pain or substantial pain like a pain reliever but it does help with muscle soreness short term.

I order for my mother, who is 93, with severe arthritis pain in her shoulders and knees. We started using this on her simply by accident. She had been using a compounded formula that was supposed to exceed anything on the market. Of course it was a prescription.  She'd been on the prescribed lotion for two or three years. Ever so often the pharmacist would make a mistake in the compounding. This was one of those times. I'd ordered myself some of the Penetrex for fibromyalgia pain. I'd not yet opened the jar, so I took it to my mother. Her caregivers started using it on her while waiting for the new batch of lotion to be mixed. We had several days before I got the prescription back to her. In the next few days one of the caregivers mentioned to me that she felt like my mother had responded better to the Penetrex than the prescription lotion. She said her knee never once locked up on her while she was using the Penetrex, but had started back locking since they'd started back on the prescription lotion. Of course I told them to go back to the Penetrex. The prescription lotion is over a hundred dollars a bottle. Needless to say, Penetrex is not nearly that amount.

It is amazing!  use it for arthritis pain, muscle soreness, back pain, pretty much anything that effects the outside of my body or muscular, strains, even to help a broken wrist heal faster with less pain.  I have been using Penetrex for somewhere around 8-10 years. ( I wish it could help my memory!)  My Rheumatologist had prescribed a cream for my arthritis pain and osteoarthritis pain which contained an NSAID.  I did not want to use any pain relievers which contained NSAIDs.  And I much prefer natural plant ingredients to anything pharmaceutical I was so excited when I first tried this product and found that it worked so much better, and without an ingredient which could harm my liver or kidneys in the long run.  I have continued using this cream and sometimes hand out little samples to friends or relatives who could benefit from it.  Check it out I promise that you won't be sorry.

I was looking for something to help me through the severe pain of pinched nerves, as I'm not a fan of being incapacitated by expensive prescription drugs all the time, wasting days in emergency rooms, being in too much pain to live, nor do I like the heart and kidney problems that come from over exposure to medicines. Around 2 years ago I got frustrated and came to Amazon to look for help. Here I found dozens of highly recommended creams. Given how much my drugs already cost me, and how much of my life I had already lost hoping for solutions, I figured that it was worth the money to try a whole bunch of the options and see what worked so I purchased almost three dozen of the top rated topical creams.I did lots of comparison tests on all the creams I received and soon threw away all but around 1/2 a dozen of the creams. Three of the creams worked on nerve pain about as well as Penetrex, however, I am vegetarian, and they were not. One of the products worked just a little less well, but was in the same price range. One of the products, the cheapest, I now get to apply to my dog, for her wobblers condition, as that product comes with a thin gel option. That product may have been the cheapest, but it was also the weakest of the products that actually seem to work at all. But Penetrex REALLY works!I later found out that I have a friend with a different condition from mine that has caused her disks to degenerate. She could barely walk from the nerve pain, and spent most of her life on super high levels of drugs that barely cut the pain. I gave her a tub of Penetrex. One month later I ran into her and she grabbed me and hugged me, crying. Apparently, Penetrex was helping her so much that she was actually able to ease off a lot of her pain killers and was able to start going on daily walks; something she hadn't been able to do in over 20 years!Interestingly enough, not only does Penetrex work well for muscle and nerve pain, but it cuts bone pain to nothing. Kinda in a scary good way...I had a friend who broke some of the bones in her foot, and didn't go to the doctor's until she had been walking on them for 4 months. Let's just say that the pain was pretty bad, and the bones were very messed up. I gave her a jar of Penetrex to help her sleep, as the doctors were still hopeful that she might not need surgery... She used the Penetrex cream and was so pain free that one day she didn't wash it off before going into work. She walked on her broken foot for an entire day and felt no pain because of the Penetrex. Lets just say that she eventually had to have the bones in her feet pinned, however, the Penetrex allowed her to sleep pain free, and recover. But she did remember to wash it off every morning after that one time...A different friend broke her leg in a weird spiral fracture that wasn't healing well and was extremely painful. I called her to check on her a week after she broke her leg. She was in very bad shape as the pain had been so bad she could barely sleep all week, and the pain pills the doctor sent her home with weren't helping at all. I was able to send a jar of Penetrex to her, and soon got a phone call from her, crying and thanking me for the Penetrex, and how much help it was. Apparently she slept for almost 2 days solid, as soon as the Penetrex cream started working. Like my friend with the broken foot, however, one day she forgot to wash the cream off her leg, and she spent the entire day blissfully puttering around the house, in no pain (forgetting to put on her removable brace/cast). However, after she took a shower, she realized the enormity of her mistake, as she had caused a lot of damage to her broken bone by walking on it all day. She didn't repeat that mistake again, and was very cautious about when she had the cream on ever after that.I later gave some to a friend who was having a lot of rib pain. He had tripped and fallen onto a small stump, where he broke 3 ribs in multiple places. he couldn't even breath or drive because of the pain, and sleeping wasn't happening. With Penetrex, he was able to sleep pain free, and recovered quickly.Honestly, although I don't know for certain, I am betting that Penetrex is every parent's dream for kids with growing pains in their legs, too. I'll report back, if I end up sharing it with anyone in that situation.The important things to know about applying Penetrex cream:- Apply an amount equivalent to a heavy coating of sunscreen.- The cream will start working immediately, but takes around 20 minutes to achieve maximum effect.- It takes about 20 minutes for the cream to absorb into your skin. Wait that full amount of time before attempting to apply another coat if you want greater relief. You can apply as many coats as needed to do the job.- Each application, when applied after the prior layer has fully absorbed, will have a cumulative effect. (If you don't wait, applying another coating to a wet coating doesn't seem to actually do more good than just applying one coating...)- If you apply a coating and the cream doesn't help much, then Penetrex is either the wrong product for the type of pain you are in, or you are not actually applying the cream at the source of your pain. (e.g., for my tennis elbow, applying Penetrex to my elbow makes my brain happy because my brain rationalizes that that's where the pain is coming from, however, it does nothing to reduce the pain. I have to apply the cream to my neck and shoulders, as that's where the pinched nerve is. When applied to my neck and shoulders, then the Penetrex cuts down on the pain from the tennis elbo. Sadly, although it helps some with the tennis elbo pain, it is definitely not the correct product for the job, as no amount of coatings is enough to actually stop the pain.)So, yes, I would and do HIGHLY recommend Penetrex. I have recommended it to at least 100 people over the 2 years since I discovered it! I also recommend it to everyone as a part of your standard first aid kit. Penetrex really has been a godsend for me and so many of my friends!",A Godsend!,Size:  Large 4 OunceVerified Purchase,35 people found this helpful

I also have basal thumb joint arthritis in both hands, but am right handed so the break at my wrist made the arthritis there more painful.I tried the the blue stuff...it was ok and the former prescription V gel and while that gave some relief, it had such a strong perfume-like fragrance that I didn't like, plus the use directions warn that you shouldn't use it more  than 21 days in a row...and it does have some very strong ingredients that get into your bloodstream and that concerned me too.  However, from another reviewer I'm reading that the MSM in Penetrex also gets into your bloodstream and that for some this causes some bad side effects.  Fortunately, I haven't experienced those side effects.  I use Penetrex twice a day and find it really does gives me relief from the mild but ongoing pain from the break (that strangely caused some sensitivity and skin irritation on my forearm too) and it also helps relieve a lot of the arthritic pain in both thumb joints.

The doctor suggested it sounded like he was having sciatica issues and thought a chiropractor or orthopedic would better serve him. We made an immediate appointment with a chiropractor the next day, he felt great when he came home but the minute he was back driving the truck, he was in severe pain, he continued to see the chiropractor for about 6 weeks and same thing so we then decided to try acupuncture, basically the same results.

I have tried other products such as Biofreeze and IcyHot which didn't work. Penetrex delivers relief immediately.

It lasts all night. In some cases, my pain is so great that Penetrex is not able to eliminate it entirely, but even on those bad days, it eases the pain.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it works just like it says it does; however, it is very expensive. But I would rather purchase one expensive product that works than several that do not work. I am unable to take ibuprofen due to a sensitive stomach, and this has no side effects. I also have extremely sensitive skin, yet I have had no allergic reactions or breakouts with this product. Along with the shipment, however, is an offer to register to receive a discount code. I will definitely be using it. I purchased the 2 oz originally, and it did last longer than I thought for that small amount, because it doesn't take much before you feel relief. Massage it in completely for best results.

I was very sick with COVID back in June 2020. After my symptoms finally started going away I noticed I was having a lot of pain in my knee. It very quickly got very painful. I developed plantar fasciitis to both feet, pain and swelling to all of my toes (and feet, and ankles), and my hands, first the left and then the right. My fingers hurt so badly  in the mornings I can not even make a fist from all the joint pain and stiffness. I tried every single ointment, gel, and cream I could get my hands on and nothing really helped. Then my husband brought me home a jar of this.I'm 34, I'm an ER nurse, I work 12 hours shifts 3 nights in a row every week. I was limping and in tears by the time I came home and literally sobbing sometimes when I woke up knowing as soon as I would start to move the pain would be unbearable. I couldn't stand to bear weight on my feet. I have orthotic insoles, wear compression stockings every day, wear plantar fasciitis splints to sleep in. I have a copper lined compression sleeve for my knee and gloves for both hands. I'm eating NSAIDS like they're skittles.Nothing I have done has even compared to the relief I get from this cream. I keep it beside my bed. I rub a little on my hands, feet, and knee when I get home from work, and as soon as I wake up it's the first thing I reach for. Within 10 minutes, sometimes less!, the pain and stiffness starts to go away and if I'm swollen that goes away some as well. I have found it does not take much to work. It melts like butter into your skin. And the best part? I can make it about 10 hours before I start to ache again. Sometimes I can even make it the whole shift. It's amazing. If you were on the fence about trying this, just do it! It is a little pricey but I'd pay triple for the pain relief it gives. And it starts working the FIRST time you use it, there is no build up like with another well known arthritis medication that needs 4 applications per day and has to build up before it works.","I can move again!

My order has always arrived on time and in good condition.I am 51 yrs old and have been suffering for several years, from pain due to injuries to both my ankles and feet, and more recently from pain in my left wrist and thumb. In the past I depended on oral pain medication for relief, but about a year ago I was diagnosed with CHF due to an enlarged heart condition. My Physicians recommended that I cut back on my oral pain medications, since they may conflict with my other medications.For the first few months it was terrible. The pain was overwhelming and I was forced to stay off my feet for hours at a time, due to my swollen and inflamed ankles. I tried many different topical treatments with marginal relief. The pain kept me from walking which is the recommended exercise for my health condition.In my online research I came across a possible infar red treatment device recommended for pain management. Someone mentioned using it together with the Penetrex cream and having good results.I was desperate for change and ordered my first jar. I used it for about two weeks, applying it almost hourly at first trying to keep the pain in check. After a few days I began to feel the difference. Since then I have been using it in conjunction with massage and the infar red treatments.Even when I don't have time for the other treatments, the Penetrex cream is part of my daily routine. The swelling in my feet and ankles as well as the pain has been significantly reduced.  My wrist is also much better and does not throb constantly. This I attribute largely to the regular use of this cream which I massage in at least twice daily to manage the pain.I have shared it with relatives and family members who have purchased their own and used it with great results and I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for relief form inflammation and the resulting pain, especially in the joints.So far I intend to continue using the Penetrex cream to help manage my pain and discomfort",This cream is great for inflammation and the resulting pain,Size: 2 OunceVerified Purchase,51 people found this helpful

Real products want it absorbed slowly otherwise you might damage your skin.2) The active ingredient is commonly used for inflammation but no there is no scientific evidence to support it. In other words it's an old wives' tale.3) Website says apply for 7 - 10 days and massage it; which is coincidently the amount of time it takes for your body to do enough repair that pain goes away; unless you do something to inflame the injury.4) Placebo effect is real.

I always walk and exercise regardless, but it had gotten so bad that I could scarcely concentrate on anything else. I used to consider Advil a miracle drug, but after a time it made my stomach crampy, and as I had known a woman who wound up with internal bleeding after taking NSAIDs for years, I thought I should switch to Tytlenol, which helps but does nothing for inflammation.I was wondering if there might be an NSAID cream I could try, and in searching Amazon I came across the Penetrex reviews, which seemed detailed enough to be credible, and ordered a 2-ounce jar.

I am in the music business and have quite an active late-blooming career, and the thought of going down the hip-replacement road prior to age 70 was alarming.I used a small amount of Penetrex four times a day.

After two weeks, almost having gone through the 2-oz jar, I realized I was walking to the park with virtually no discomfort. It was incredible. I ordered the larger jar, which I am continuing to use several times a day for now. I am not completely free of pain, but so much better that when I got the usual follow-up email from the seller I thought I should write a review.I always take the possibility of a placebo effect into account, but I think this stuff works. If you’d like to do some research, look on PubMed for clinical trials studying the benefits of arnica, the primary ingredient in Penetrex.

So I am in pain frequently. I have done the pain meds route (Advil, Tylenol, Tumeric, Gabapentin, lyrica, muscle relaxants, magnesium, opioids) They all have well known side effects--I have an ulcer now so NSAIDs are not an option), and I do not like being tired, and I will still use natural supplements---esp., Magnesium, Tumeric aka Curcumin, MSM,) and an occasional pain med, RICE and an infra red lamp--all provided various degrees of relief but  I was so happy to be introduced to Penetrex.

I was diagnosed with large defects in the cartilage in both knees 2 years ago at the age of 47.  I'm too young for knee replacement, but was told by my orthopedic specialist that I had to suffer through the pain until I was old enough.  I was put on Celebrex for my issues, but I'm not a fan of taking an anti-inflammatory daily for the rest of my life.  A friend recommended using Arnica creams to help with the pain.  I tried one popular brand, and had some improvement, but still found myself needing that Celebrex.  Penetrex came up as ""suggested for me"" on Amazon, it was on deal of the day, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I liked that it had MSM in it, which is proven to decrease inflammation.  Oral MSM made me feel better, but also broke me out in hives, so I thought I'd try the topical version.All I can say is I am happy I did!  Penetrex soothes my achy joints, and even helped when I wrenched my lower back.  I put it on every night before bed, when my knees ache the most, and during the day if needed.  If I didn't experience the relief of the pain and inflammation I would not believe it.  It works.  I make sure to massage it in until the cream is absorbed which makes a difference.  The ache subsides; my knees feel better.  I re-apply during the day as I need, and every time I can feel the ache lessen.The product has a very light scent, which is an added bonus.  I'm on my 4th jar of the stuff and I've noticed not change in the effectiveness.  I'm a believer.

Very satisfied repeat customer. Non-greasy, absorbs quickly, works quickly! I am extremely sensitive to fragrances and I will say that while this definitely has a hint of menthol-y odor comparable to all muscle rub OTC products, it is much milder and fades fairly quickly. Unlike other such products (which honestly aren't even in the same class as Penetrex), I don't hesitate to apply it before leaving the house. No one is likely to notice the scent unless they're directly sniffing the application site.As a mom of 2 young children who suffers from chronic pain (due to a variety of physical conditions and previous injuries), I need something that helps reduce my pain without lasting negative side effects, such as fatigue.This cream really works. Honestly, compared to other pain creams, it's like the difference between a prescription and an OTC product. As stated on the label, when you first start using it you should apply it more liberally. After that initial period, however, you will discover increased results with fewer applications. It's truly amazing.Whenever I experience ""break through"" pain, I apply this, and within an hour or so I generally experience enough relief to avoid having to turn to pain medications. Occasionally, when my pain is bad enough to keep me awake... Penetrex comes to the rescue and provides enough relief for me to finally get some rest.Now, I wish I could say it has completely replaced all pain medications, tens units, orthopedic devices, massage, etc. in my life - but that would require a miracle. It has, however, significantly decreased my reliance on those things. I have a good routine now, and if something aggravates my condition, Penetrex is there for me, without fail.I make sure I always have some on hand - the prospect of running out is definitely anxiety producing! My ex tried it and was so impressed he wanted to take my spare jar (yeah, that didn't happen).Bonus use for parents: my children know this is my ""owie"" cream, and I have successfully used it on their little bumps and bruises, when they just want you to ""do something."" You can't put a band-aid on every owie, but you can use a little Penetrex! And it REALLY helps my son's growing pains in his legs, and the occasional Charlie horse. As an added bonus, my 3 year old daughter takes great pride in helping apply the cream on mommy - yes, I still have to help rub it in, ha ha, but I'm hoping to prepare her for a life of servitude as my personal masseuse.

I couldn't understand, as I'd not done anything to cause a flareup--but the tingling and numbness noticeably worsened. I realized I'd started using the Penetrex on my wrist. I stopped and the carpal tunnel symptoms dropped to their usual levels. Odd, to say the least, but it works so well on everything else that I figured that for whatever the reason one of the ingredients was causing a bad reaction. Regardless, I continue to use Penetrex for the arthritis and it works incredibly well.I'm sure the ""penetrating"" part is facilitated by the DMSO, a long-used compound for bringing a substance deep into a joint.

I will say this, though. It's crazy good for pain relief, but it's not a good idea to use it, and then keep doing what you're doing because whatever hurts doesn't hurt now. I use it on my SI joints, so basically I can't just be anywhere to rub this pretty much on my butt. (I did it in my car and got weird looks). I had to deal with something so inflamed it hurt to put it on. So I learned to rub this on and wait a few minutes, and then I can rub it in deeper, and get REALLY good pain relief. But it's something that has to be used constantly, so I use it when things hurt bad, but not as something to remove pain. Just numb it for awhile.Adding this: It worked on my back for a new source of pain (YAY) very very well. As far as a rub in at night and go to bed creams, this one definitely does not fail.

I will NEVER stop using this stuff.Update Dec. 2015.Since I just received a new jar of Penetrex, I wanted to add an addendum to my above 5 star review.  The constant pain in my hip trochanter joint, that I have had for the past 20 years, finally decreased enough for me to sleep on my side for the first time in 10 years. It took about 2-3 weeks of diligent use as directed on the packaging.  Unfortunately, as I started feeling good, I became less diligent about using my Penetrex and the pain slowly ramped back up.  I started again on my nightly routine of rubbing Penetrex into the joint each night and the pain is again under control.  It will not make the joint feel temporarily cool, like  China Gel , but with regular use, it significantly reduces the pain of bursitis.  If you are unfamiliar with hip pain associated with Trochanteric bursitis here is some info:-  Trochanteric bursitis is inflammation of the bursa (fluid-filled sac near a joint) at the outside (lateral) point of the hip known as the greater trochanter. When this bursa becomes irritated or inflamed, it causes pain in the hip. This is a common cause of hip pain.-Trochanteric bursitis typically causes the following symptoms:Pain on the outside of the hip and thigh or in the buttock.Pain when lying on the affected side.Pain when you press in on the outside of the hip.Pain that gets worse during activities such as getting up from a deep chair or getting out of a car.",I put this on every night before I go to sleep and it really is amazing.

A lot of CBD type creams and a lot of the hot/cold type creams. However, this one really works for me. In particular it has been super helpful for achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis pains. I rub in multiple times a day and I notice way less pain and what seems like quicker recovery when I have it. These tend to be chronic issues - and they will go away for a while but come back if I'm not 100% on top of my strength training, stretching, meditation and just general wellness.I looked it up and I first purchased this cream in 2014 - for achilles issues. I liked it then and, when those same type of issues flared again along with some heel pain I went back and searched for what I used before. This was it. A lot of the other creams work maybe better for immediate pain relief but my observation is that this brings pain relief AND healing to where the issue starts to go away and eventually disappears (note: I am also doing other things that contribute like examining my running gait and making sure my nutrition is good and so on).

As an example one of my children had a mosquito bite above the eyebrow that was causing the eye to swell shut.  I massaged a small amount on the bite and within an hour the swelling had reduced, she was not scratching it, and she could open her eye.

As soon as she reached USA, she started taking rest and not coming out of her room much. First I thought she is Jet lag. It continued for 1 month and as a worried daughter was trying to figure out what is happening. I know my mother has a Knee gap for past few years now... so was trying to give her space to rest and recover. However with time it was getting worst. Whatever she asked and I could think of I did that for her... including hot water bottles, pain killers which she was carrying with her from India with her doctor consultation. Nothing was working... I started taking her out in apartment for a short walks which I could sense that she is not able to do but pushing herself because I asked her to try to walk a little.I could not see her in pain so I reached out to one of my friends mother who is a doctor in Santa Clara County Hospital (Great help). Just want to make sure if I am missing anything or doing wrong, Any medicine which I can buy over the counter for mother OR IF I need to take mother to the urgent care as the pain was increasing day by day.. Doctor (friends mother) after hearing my mothers history and what we have don't in past one month for her and the medicine my mother is taking etc....  Doctor suggested nothing to worry about which gave us relief that we don't have to rush to the urgent care![IMPORTANT] ::::THINGS WE WERE DOING WRONG ->1. Hot water bottle - doctor said when there is a pain around the knee we should not use hot water we should use COLD PACK or ICE. Apply ICE/COLD PACK around the knee for minimum of 15 and max of 20 minutes --> 4 to 5 times a day.2. Buy a comfortable STICK -> Stick will help her to walk with balance and grip.3. Get her COLLAGEN or GLUCOSAMINE tables -> you can buy these over the counter -> best place to get these are from Costco -> I started giving mother half tablet a day. Just wanted to be sure its not having any side effects on her healthy and she is feeling all right. After assessing that she is fine taking COLLAGEN tablet, after 1 week I started giving her one full tablet a day. This was Kirkland COLLAGEN small tablets you get in Costco for $17 or $20.  COLLAGEN will take its time to help mother to get relief with pain.4. now comes PENETREX Pain Relief in picture -> one of neighbor in my apartment saw me walking with my mother and noticed that mother is having hard time and walking slow like baby steps. He asked me what happened to mom. I told him that mother is having a knee pain because she has gap in both her knees and now with long travel she is experiencing pain and not able to walk much.(God bless this guy) as he shared that similar issue was there with his mother in law, when she visited them in USA. He shared ""Penetrex Pain Relief"" you get it on Amazon and worth trying.  Now we are not comfortable with trying any medicine and specially on 70 years old mother. No way!!!  I went online read about Penetrex Pain Relief and found that thousands of people are using it and reviewed it. I discussed with family about Penetrex Pain Relief and good part was its a cream not a table. So instead of applying spray or iodex, we ordered Penetrex Pain Relief and applied on my mothers knee for 2-4 days/twice a day/morning and night during sleep time.We got instant results. Now I could see that mom is able to stand and walking inside the house. This was a great improvement. We continued with cream for few more days until mother felt relief in pain. Also continued with doctor's advise with ""COLLAGEN tablet course for 90 days"". By Mid-September mother felt all right and we were happy. I ordered 4 more bottles of Penetrex Pain Relief Therapy [4 Oz]. While returning Home/India I gave her 3 bottles with her. She does not require to use Penetrex Cream often but whenever she experience pain she applies it and next day better.  Along with PENETREX Cream, I also gave her 3 bottles of Kirkland COLLAGEN, which she consulted with her doctor in India and takes it with a break of 2 months. As we don't want her to get depended on tables. Specially at her age of 70, any medicine is not good for her health if it's for long term.OVERALL We are happy and satisfied with ""Penetrex Pain Relief Therapy"". Its worth spending $100 for buy the combo.  I wish the readers well and hope this helps you and your loved ones.

So, I ordered it for my 90-year-old mom, who had constant back pain.  Previously, she had tried many other rubs that never helped much, so we didn't expect a lot.  To my great surprise, she reported that it helped - a lot!  She dreaded running out, so made sure that I got it for her in time.  She used it daily until she passed at 94.  Meanwhile, thought I'd get some for my husband, for his RA.  He too, didn't expect much, but he too became hooked.  Surprised me greatly.  My sister reports the same success - really helps her autoimmune joint pain.Now, I too have had to try some of my husbands, due to a knee injury and apparently also arthritis setting in.

It started with numb pain in my left shoulder, then my neck and the whole left side got stiff. I could hear cracking in my ears if I moved my head.

Swimming in the pool and sauna only gave me temporary relief, but I couldn't sleep at night and when my muscles cooled off, or in the morning, numb pain was unbearable. I even tied my shoulders with a scarf so they don't move, I had that feeling my left shoulder will fall off, and the pain. I kept working, what can I do.... 2 nights ago, already desperate, I went on amazon to check is there any cream or ointment that I can use. I hate those cheap creams from CVS and Walgreens that freeze you or burn you with unbearable smell of menthol and do nothing.So, this morning I got this cream delivered, and honestly, after 1 use, I felt instant relief. The whole morning I was in pain, I couldn't sleep last night, and sitting in front of my computer was not bearable. I was facing another wasted day in pain, and I only have 1 -2 days off in the week, working days and nights. I got delivery, and I rubbed in Penetrex, using rubber glove so my hand doesn't soak it and I massaged my shoulder to soak in. I felt instant relief after only few minutes. I guess I picked the right stuff and it helped immediately with the inflammation that I could still feel weeks after my injury.An update, September 2019Penetrex successfully healed my shoulder and I kept buying it over the years to relief pain in my wrists, and other work related discomforts. I also bought some for my friends, who didn't believe it will work but it did.One of them came back after 7 days camping and a pain in the hip.

Penetrex works rapidly to relieve (and, I believe, heal) tendonitis pain. Having dealt with occasional bouts of tendonitis over the past twenty years, I have tried a number of other topical products to relieve the nagging pain. It seems that elbows and wrists can be difficult to rehab, perhaps due to low blood flow in those areas?At any rate, using Penetrex *consistently* several times a day typically resolves my pain within a matter of a few days. Your experience may vary. As to application, the cream takes some commitment because you're supposed to rub it in until it's completely absorbed. If you over-apply, it can be a little greasy and will then take forever to rub in, so just use what you need. However,  time spent to rub it in for the pain relief is worth it. The smell is a little medicinal but it's not overly strong or unpleasant, at least to me.DISCLAMER: I was asked to write a review for this product in order to receive a free jar. I have bought gift jars for others on the strength of my experience with the product. Thus I am able to write a positive review without hesitation.

I had surgery in 2010 in which I have pins and screws in my spine. I went through a straight year of therapy 3 days a week to get myself back to the 80% health that m doctor told me I could reach if I did everything he recommended I do to get back to a close to pain free normal life. To my surprise I did it and it worked. I was living a normal life after a year. But come 8 years later the sciatica pain came back and it was determined that it is my spine again but this time I have a chance to hopefully not have to go to surgery, at least not yet. I am doing therapy and had taken a 12 day dose of steroids. Both is helping but the steroids totally stopped the streak of thigh pain. Only problem it didn't stop the pain for as long as we hoped, pain returned after 56 days of finishing the steroids. I'm still doing therapy but I do get the pain though thigh but not real bad but enough to slow down my life.

Believe you/ me I rubbed this cream on my back and I had immediate results. It is a miracle cream. It took  85% of the sharp streaking pain away from my thigh. I do use it at least 3 times a day and I get wonderful results. I want you all to know that even though I use this I also complete my physical therapy 5 days a week as well. I have not just used this non steroid inflammation cream alone, so therefore I just wanted to make that clear. But if you have pain from sciatica believe me you need to strongly consider purchasing this and giving it a chance. I am so glad I gave this product a try which was hard for me for I had used icy hot, the patch, many off the shelf meds and nothing worked for more than the time it took to wear off which was no more than a few hours. If you use this like it's instructed you will get long time relief, even an all 8 hours of restful sleep.

I am sure there are many who share the fear that I do even at the thought of an attack, the uncontrollable and unimaginable stinging and stabbing pain, just when you just about close your eyes after days sleeplessness and fatigue. Its living hell.For years I kept trying to do and follow all I read and heard, ACV, baking soda, colchicine, black cherry juice, Lemon juice, raw food, Papaya tea, stopped beer, wine, drink crazy amounts of water, but like we all know it will get you if it decides to. The worst thing other than the constant and incredible pain is the sudden buckling, stabbing and the poking of the affected as if with a burning hot steel knife and the sleeplessness because of the stinging pain and the helplessness only the sufferers will know, I am sure all of us who go through severe attacks would have considered amputation 😊, Well the ones who don’t have it will never understand.I used to keep looking at every source, Google, Amazon, books, magazines for something, anything that will take away the edge of the knife stab-like pain and have tried every cream or painkiller available. Purchasing the first jar of Penetrex was one such experiment as well. I will not ever say that it gets rid of gout pain, but it is a champion in taking the sting out of the debilitating pain for a reasonable length of time, and that’s all sometimes one needs when you are undergoing such an attack, for sleep to set in which aids in healing quicker.I am thankful and grateful that I did it, It is a life saver, I have even purchased and sent it to a cousin of mine in India who suffers just the way I do when I have an attack, I generally get the attack either on my big toe or the ankle and trust me this helps in lowering the pain to very manageable levels. I can't be certain that it probably has the same effect on any of you who try it, but I pray it does.I generally do not write reviews and am lazy about it, however, this one definitely needs a mention and surely deserves to be shared Even if one gout sufferer is benefited, I guess this review would have achieved its purpose.",Gout sufferers - You deserve to read this,Size: 2 OunceVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

My fiance is a drummer and would use it to soothe his hands, wrists, and arms after a hard-hitting gig. But we hadn't had occasion to REALLY put it to the test until now - I was in a car accident a couple of weeks ago and got pretty banged up. In addition to a fractured foot, both of my knees were severely painfully bruised (they must have hit the dashboard), and my right hand and wrist were badly strained and bruised from trying to brace myself from the impact. My palm and the area between my thumb and pointer finger (where I grasped the steering wheel) were a dark purple. I also had deep bruising across my chest where the seat belt dug into me. Overall, a lot of deep bruising, wrenched joints, and injured tissue.Since we didn't have to use it that much, I still had the jar of Penetrex I bought years ago, but I noticed it had expired, so I just purchased a fresh one, along with the new roll-on. I started using the old one while waiting to receive the new one and I think it helped a bit, but I really noticed a difference when I started using the fresh Penetrex. Within days, the deep purple bruising on my palm was almost gone. My right wrist feels a lot better, although it still hurts when I move it at certain angles (I'm hoping that it will continue improving, though the Dr. warned that there's a long-term  risk for carpal tunnel syndrome with an injury like this. Let's hope Penetrex can help me stave that off).Both my knees are healing nicely - pain and bruising have greatly diminished and the bruising across my chest is gone. I tend to heal well, but I feel that Penetrex accelerated that process with respect to the bruising and pain from the accident. The fractured foot is another story - I have had to have surgery to repair a displaced calcaneal fracture and I am looking at a lengthy healing process with that. Given the long-term prognosis for potential residual issues for this type of fracture, I am hoping Penetrex will help me there. I have a positive outlook on my healing ability, but I'll take all the help I can get :)I do a lot of research into whatever I put in and on my body and I lean toward as natural a healing process as I can (given that, I am also grateful for an expert surgeon who put my heel back together). I like that Penetrex's healing ingredients are well-researched natural elements, not pharmaceutical synthetics. I like the convenience of the roll-on, but I think I prefer the therapeutic act of rubbing the cream into the injured area.This is one healing product that I will always make sure to have on hand - and from now on, I'll take care to keep an eye on the expiration date so I have a fresh full-strength jar when I need it. I hope you don't need it as badly as I did.

This cream is formulated and made in the USA, which is unusual. The company and the customer service stand by the product. Fast with their responses and genuine approach to problem resolution. We have communicated with them and their responses via e-mail are within 24 hours. Very courteous and polite.The cream. From lower back pain to joints on hands - works like a charm. Recently have been applying to feet for RLS and it works perfectly as well. Applying pea-sized quantity takes care of the problematic pain.Formulation - no additives. Plain, clean product with ingredients one expects.  No mad science behind it, but pure ingredients and no greasy residue after applying it to the skin. Skin is the largest organ and whatever we apply to it - becomes part of us. So, we feel good about applying this cream that works perfectly relieving pain symptoms.As long as Penetrex does not get sold to some giant corporation that will mess-up this AWESOME product!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!A+",Penetrex is the lifeline for those with arthritis and pain!!!,Size: 2 OunceVerified Purchase,

Kind of odd, I don't have it anywhere else, but try not using your thumbs for a day and you'll see the problem.In the last couple of years it's gotten worse (confirmed by x-ray - the cartilage is gone). I consulted a surgeon who said I was too young for any type of surgery (hint: The only thing available is to fuse the bones -- yikes!) - he thought steroid injections would lead to further deterioration so he recommended a splinting procedure to allow the joint s to rest -  you wear thumb splints - they're uncomfortable and inconvenient, and they mobilize your thumbs - but they do help. Obviously, I would love a better solutions (I'm an IT guy - I type a lot including using my thumbs)I tried a lot of OTC pain medications including Arthritis cremes, Blue Emu, which BTW, I believe is a very fine muscle application, but does not touch the arthritis, and other topicals, like Tiger Balm and Cobra Venom most of which have been largely useless.Nothing except Penetrex has ever come close to touching the deep bone-on-bone pain I feel in my thumbs.Obviously, it's not magic. It does not replace cartilage but it seems to have anti-inflammatory properties similar to a mild dose of steroids (with none of the side-effects). I find my movement range increases and the pain is significantly reduced when I grip something - the pain is not ""gone"" but I'm no longer wincing from it when I open a bottle or grip a tool.I have also tried competitive preparations, including CT creme which has some of the same main ingredient  (Arnica) and found them ineffective. Basically, there's something in Penetrex that just works. Note that studies on Arnica, a type sunflower, support it's anti inflammatory use (go look it up on google - ""arnica studies"") although there's no compelling studies to validate it's use in arthritis pain, so take this review with a grain of salt - these are personal experiences.That being said, after my success with Penetrx,  I recommended it to several colleagues who found the same and I also regularly purchase it for my 94 year old father who complained of the same ""Bone-on Bone"" pain in his back and shoulders. I also have not needed to use my thumb splints for about 6 months now since starting to use Penetrx, so regardless of any studies, I'm very satisfied with the results.The good: It smells GREAT - it's not sticky, or slick --  there's a VERY mild hint of mint and it actually leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.The great: Over time it reduces inflammation and  you actually need to use less of itThe not-so-great: It takes time to work, it's easily twice the cost of something like  Blue Emu, BUT it kills pain that other topicals cannot touch.Usage - I would make it clear again that this is medicine, not magic. It goes to work very slowly. Whereas you might expect a topical like something with Menthol (icy hot or the like)  to work quickly I've found it takes about a week or even two to ""ramp up"" with Penetrex. That being said, once it does, it's very effective and you need less of it on a less frequent basis.I've tried Penetrex at times on more ""muscular"" aches and pains and actually would not recommend it for this purpose (it works too slowly and it's too expensive), but if you've got deep, chronic ""bone on bone"" ache, give it a try  (and give it a chance - I'd recommend using an entire 2 ounce treatment over two to three weeks before making any decisions) and I suspect you'll  find significant value in the treatment.I did, my 94 year old Dad did and my friend who's just recovering from spinal surgery did too.Do your own homework, then give it a try and let others know what you think. Look at the star ratings here as well - as of this date, over 1600 of the 2000 ratings are 4-5 starts with the majority in the 5 star range. Either that's a lot of placebo talking, or these guys have figured something out.Either way, I'm happy and will continue to buy the product my purposes - long term relieve of bone-on-bone pain.",Excellent Long Term Treatment for Bone-on-Bone pain,Size:  Large 4 OunceVerified Purchase,153 people found this helpful

I opened my door at 3 am and there was my Penetrex. Instead of taking Tylenon, I applied Penetrex right away on the ankle and the pain was gone and I was able to sleep around 4 am.It has been wonderful to have the penetrex around to manage my pain.",This product really gives me a great relief from pain after my ACL knee reconstruction surgery!,Size: 2 OunceVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Our teenager is an athlete and it has worked at night after a good workout and shower for him to use on his legs, back, arms or whatever muscles are aching. He says he feels better in the morning.I definitely recommend having this in your medicine cabinet if anyone in your household has muscle or back pain or does sports. It is a topical cream that blends easily (not too heavy) and has natural anti-infllammatory properties that work.","Great for sore muscles, back, and for athletes!",Size:  Large 4 OunceVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful

Having spent the better part of the past week wracked with pain so excruciating the thought crossed my mind -- not that I'd ever act upon it, but I now have personal, experiential understanding of the impulse -- ""Somebody PLEASE put me outta my misery!""Then, my Amazon order, including my 2oz jar of Penetrex, came this morning, right in the nick of time! As soon as I got it upstairs, I opened it, and rubbed it into the center of greatest nerve pain from my regenerating sciatic nerve, my left shin.(6 years ago I was almost run over by a reckless underinsured driver. Due, I suspect, to continued pressure from massive hematomas in that leg, my left sciatic nerve -- the big nerve that starts in the small of you back, cuts across your buttock, branches off in your groin, and down both sides of your leg, innervating your muscles and joints, all the way down to your toes -- had much of it's function literally crushed, thus limiting the function of my left leg. Since I've recently been concerned that the muscles of my left leg are STILL considerably smaller than those of my right -- AND, I could barely move my toes at all, much less move my big toe separately from the others -- I'd been intensely working my left leg, foot, and toes.(Gradually, I saw results; even my bunion appeared to be straightening. Even the arch of my left began rebuilding itself! Then, last weekend my left sciatic nerve started acting up. I thought is was just a a garden variety sciatic attack. But as time progressed, the pain went down my leg on both sides, eventually along the entire length of my left sciatic nerve. The pain pulsed, moved, and twitched -- first in spasms, then in waves. Since my 6 years of rebuilding and rewiring my body has left me keenly aware of my internal goings on, I KNEW it was my left sciatic nerve regenerating itself. And it was so intense, I suspect the only worse pain would be labor pain, or extreme burns, like the time my foot was scalded by hot bacon grease.)As soon as I rubbed the Penetrex into the outside of my left calf, my mind cleared as the pain drained from that area of my leg. I immediately rubbed it everywhere my left leg and buttock hurt. The pain drained away, as if by magic! This stuff is as good as, if not better than prescription Voltarin!I felt SO good, I went grocery shopping, which had been needed for daze; but my pain had procluded -- expecting I'd need to collapse into a hot salt bath as soon as I got home. But not so fast! Not only was I able to put all my groceries away as soon as I returned, 2 and a half hours later, my pain is still subsided!I've tried other similar products over the years -- some with even longer lists of homeopathic, herbal, and essential oil ingredients -- but THIS IS IT, the Holy Grail of Topical Pain Relief. I suspect that has something to do with their delivery system. No wonder they call it Penetrex! Merci beaucoup, Penetrex!

I bought it for my father who was experiencing a lot of knee pain due to a torn meniscus. I live in Oregon where marijuana is legal, so I bought him some CBD oil to rub into his knee in hopes of alleviating some of his pain. It was working but was really expensive and my dad lives in Arizona so it was not something readily available to him. So I set out to find a comparable alternative.  That is when I came across penetrex on amazon and read all the glowing reviews. I thought I would give it a try and have some sent to my dad. Not only did my dad try it, but he became obsessed with it. He swears it is better than the much pricier CBD oil. Now my entire family uses it. I am just so thankful for Penetrex. It is so difficult to watch someone you love in pain and I can't help but be grateful that there is something that lessens my dad's struggle and gives him a break from his pain.

And, the pain I encounter on a daily basis is almost more than I can physically bear. I take multiple meds to help with the pain, even opioid pain relief, and some days, nothing touches the pain.That is until I found Penetrex. To this day, I still don't know how I found it. Literally, one moment, there it was on Amazon and I decided to try it. It was a little pricey but with the promise of a full refund, I was game to try it. I was willing to try anything that could help with my pain.To help manage my pain (before I was finally, after 6 years of suffering from pain, sent to a State Pain clinic to help manage the pain with opioids and other narcotics), I have tried surgery, Voltaren cream, lidocaine patches, spinal stimulator, tens machine, a compound made by my local pharmacy, Capsacien cream (when I put it on, I couldn't feel anything so I kept applying more and more. About 30 minutes later, it ""kicked"" in with so much heat, I literally thought I was on fire. And it hurt like the dickens- that kind of heat did NOT help, it only made things more painful for me), leg, back and foot nerve blocks to name some things I have tried, and NOT ONE of them offered a measure of relief. I get several measures of relief from Penetrex.After having to be on my feet all day, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my shoes and socks and put Penetrex on the parts of my feet that are so very sore. It often works immediately to remove pain. I may sit and put several light applications of Penetrex on a part of my foot where the pain has not yet subsided. I massage the cream into the skin and before very long, about 88-94% of the pain has lessened, if not gone completely away.I had a toe amputated a few years ago and the stump of it can be my most painful part of my foot. I'll rub the Penetrex on, massage, another light dose of cream, massage it in, and I may do this 4-7 times. I'm so sold on how well Penetrex works that I've told loads of people about it. I've also purchased several jars and given them to loved ones who also suffer from pain and it has worked miracles for them as well.Oh. I forgot to mention that it takes but a little Penetrex to do the job. The consistency of it is very nice. A 2-ounce jar can last for weeks.I would NEVER send my Penetrex back nor will I EVER stop using it!! It has been the ONLY topical item that has worked at ALL on my pain and I have tried a myriad of them. Thank the Heavens, literally, for whomever created Penetrex.

I didn't give penetrex the credit, but perhaps I should have. When I've forgotten I had this in the cabinet, I've suffered for several days, even weeks. When I remember that Penetrex seemed to save me the last time I was in that condition, I apply again. I've never applied it more than twice. It seems to provide much relief after just one application and complete relief after two. I can't say for sure it's the reason I seem to heal more quickly, but it sure seems like it.

The results may not be as dramatic as mine,but when I was desperately looking for something to relieve pain, a review like this was really helpful..I love that it doesn’t smell like Icy Hot, etc. I’ve only used it on my hands, however, because of the price. I hadn’t read anywhere prior to purchase that it should be applied like 7-8 x daily for a while and then titrate down until you’re at 1-2 x daily. I was super disappointed to read that because it was way to expensive for me to use it to that degree. But, having the success I’ve had using it far less often, I’ll probably buy a big jar and try using it as directed for a while and see if things can get even better. I’ve only used this on my hands—arthritis pretty bad in 4 fingers. For anyone planning to use it primarily on larger areas of the body, I’d get the big jar and give it a try. They appear to have a very liberal return policy so you don’t really have much to lose.Anyway, First thing in the morning and right before bed I apply a liberal amount-not gobs-and then wear compression gloves. They stay on overnight sometimes, and other times I use the finger splints made by the hand doctor.  After a night with the splints is when the efficacy of cream and gloves in the AM is most noticeable. I think when the gloves and cream stay on over night, the improvement just isn’t as noticeable. First thing in the morning, I warm my hands up with a little hot pack, apply the cream, put on the compression gloves, AND, do hand/finger exercises. The pain isn’t gone, but it’s 95% better. I can definitively say that doing the exercises alone brought not a tenth of the relief as doing the combination.Whether or not the cream, gloves, & splints would have been as effective WITHOUT the exercises, I don’t know. For those who are able, be religious with the hand and finger exercises. I’m absolutely amazed at the flexibility that’s returned and I know it’s a result of exercising. All I have to do is skip a day to realize their importance.Bottom line....I’m thrilled that I gave it a try and would definitely recommend others to do the same! Hope this info is helpful.

I was waking up in the night with persistent pain in my lower back and left leg. In the early stages of dealing with all of this, I would have done almost anything, paid almost any reasonable amount for a solution that would allow me to get back to my normal routine of weekend warrior. So I tried this product based on reviews and a recommendation. There were reviews where people commented that they felt it helped them while a spouse or friend was telling them it was all a placebo effect or more about massaging the injured area. I thought, I don't care if it is a placebo effect, my only goal is to not be in pain. I can't say that it is the miracle lotion that others experience and describe - It did not cure my sciatica or immediately make me 100%. However, it did help. A lot of things in combination has helped me to overcome the pain that I was dealing with, and this was definitely part of the mix. I liked that you are directly addressing the area where you need relief as opposed to popping Motrin and have it flood your entire system. I actually feel like you can feel the lotion absorb into the area where applied. There is no overwhelming or bad smell. It's rather nice. I started with two, two ounce jars. They lasted me about two months. When I started noticing big positive improvements in mobility and how I was feeling, I decided to buy the larger jar for any relapse or other muscle pain I have to deal with. I do recommend - not as a miracle cure, but something that does work in the treatment of reducing pain and rehabbing an injury.","Not a Miracle Cure, But It Works For Me",Size:  Large 4 OunceVerified Purchase,15 people found this helpful

It is a little expensive for someone on a fixed income, but a prescribed treatment has cost more in the past with less positive results.

First of all, it WORKS!! it is definitively not equivalent of 800 mg of ibuprofen but for all everyday (aging) purposes it works.  after 15 minutes of application lower back and joint stiffness goes away. in case of sore muscles even faster.in addition it is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and mild odor goes away after a minute.one surprising fact, not related to quality of the product but to the company, is that recently they send me a free bottle of their roll-on version. existing customer!! that is a way to treat customers, no that ""only new customers"" nonsense.i am aware that people react differently to medications but would definitively recommend to everyone to try it, as i am to all my friend who complain to similar symptoms as mine","excellent, works as advettrized",Size: 2 OunceVerified Purchase,

For those readers who have never had this type of injury, it can ache all day and night and flare up at any moment if you move the wrong way.  Because the product had great reviews, I thought I would give it a try.I will have to say that rarely have I been as delighted with a product as I am with Penetrex.  This is very effective in eliminating my pain when applied to the skin over my injury.  The pain goes away pretty quickly, and the product has a lovely, light minty scent that I adore.  It also has a nice, smooth consistency and quickly sinks into the skin, leaving no greasy residue on clothes or hands.  The product states that it does not heat or cool the skin, like some other products, but I have felt a cool sensation right after application.This next part might sound a bit peculiar, but I've also used the Penetrex on my lower arms and hands before going to bed to alleviate numbness and aching that occur during the night, due to what I assume is reduced blood flow.  Not only does that work, but the Penetrex has also helped to heal up some scarring I have from a bad encounter with Poison Oak.  I am thrilled, because I've been healing from this for about a year, and seeing this level of improvement makes me hopeful that all the scarring will eventually be gone.Thank you very much to the makers of Penetrex!
