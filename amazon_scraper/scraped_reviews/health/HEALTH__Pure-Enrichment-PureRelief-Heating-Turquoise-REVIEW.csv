It is a good size, it has an easy-to-use control, with 6 heat settings, and yes, it really gets hot! It is soft and flexible to use.

I haven't used the moist heat capability yet, but I am glad that is an option. I also like that it has the option to turn off after two hours.

I do have issues and probably would not have bought this one if I had known. Not a true deal killer, but the ""XL - King Size"" is a joke.It is less than 1/20th of the size of a King Size mattress, about the size of my pillow case. Like a (flat) pillow, it fits under two feet or two legs or across the small of the back. That said, the temp works. I find #2 is comfy all night long and #3 too warm all night long. The ""wet"" property is good if you go too high and sweat. And the cover is very soft one one side. Since the pad does warm up fast, it is great to put on a pillow or bed spot to heat up a spot before getting in bed or chair.The issues I have relate to the control and cord. The control buttons are too easy to touch and turn on or off features way too easily in the middle of the night. The distance between the pad and control is very short, so the control can get up into bed and/or be very difficult to reach. When the pad is under my neck, the control can be under me if I roll over the wrong way. So I will probably cut the wire and splice in an extra 3-5 feet of wire between the pad and control (safely using an electrician's splice). As others have noted, the kludge connector from the wire to pad is bulky and uncomfortable when you lie on it. The short overall cord length requires an extension cord to reach the outlet. At this price, a longer cord seems better than people using a cheap extension cord that might be under capacity of the this small pad.","It works, Pillow size, NOT King, & some Control design issues.",Color: GrayVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,945,436.0,Public,33581.0

The heat that it puts out is more than adequate. My only complaints with this thing are these. First, I wish it had some kind of strap you could put around your chest so you could position it on your back more easily rather than laying it down and hoping you lay on it in the right spot, or tossing it over your shoulder hoping you hit where you want it. The second issue is the controller. The way it's oriented feels wrong. You expect the bottom to have more pull to it when you hold it, but it's the top that pulls. I know that probably doesn't make sense, but if you purchase this you will understand what I mean. The closest thing I can relate it to is this. Plug your cell phone into it's charging cable. Chances are the cable goes into the bottom of your phone and it feels right when you hold it while it's plugged in. Now keep it plugged in, but rotate it 180 degrees so that the cable is now at the TOP of your hand. That's what I mean. It doesn't feel right. But once you get past those two things it boils down to that this is a great heating pad. Definitely worth a shot.",Excellent heating pad,Color: GrayVerified Purchase,,432,128.0,Public,9905.0

I needed a simple electric heating pad for muscle pain.  I hurt my neck and shoulder and that muscle runs down the back and affects a big area.  This heating pad is a nice size for that injury.  I also think that while the control in clunky, it is a nice fit in your hand.  Overall, the heat temperature is good but you do need to use it on the highest temp 6 in order to get any kind of relief (at least in my opinion).  The lower temperatures are not so good.  They feel more like what a blanket does, just targeted warmth.  Last, I did get an error message when I disconnected the power cord from the heating pad and tried to reconnect without taking the cord out of the wall.  The ""F"" error showed up and I figured it is because the cord was already connected so I disconnected the power cord from the wall, reconnected the heating pad, then replugged it into the wall and the error message was gone.  This means that although it would be nicer to not have to reach behind my headboard to reconnect the power, I will have to do exactly that every time I use it because otherwise that error occurs.

With a large easy to read control fob, 6 levels of heat, and the ability to disconnect the 2 hr auto off function, i was excited when it arrived in the mail.When I received the Amazon package, I immediately opened the box, looked over the various, yet quite standard reading materials, and proceeded to plug the electrical card into a nearby outlet. I was pleasantly surprised by the length of the power cord and the size of the heating area. If the heat distribution was consistent though-out the large pad, I was in for a treat.After positioning the heating pad I clicked the power button on the fob and turned it up to 6, the highest setting. Within 10 seconds i began feeling heat emitting from the pad. The heat was even through-out the application area and was quite fast warming up. It was only after a few minutes that I began noticing a similar issue to other heating pads. Though this heating pad is exceptional in build quality, maximum coverage, ease of technology and start time, the pad fails in the same area that so many others have as well. Once the pad reaches max heat, it quickly begins cooling down. Either as a safety feature to limit burn exposure or in efforts to prevent the possibility of fires, most heating pads turn off the heating element after a few minutes on high. The result can be rather frustrating for the common user simply in search of the hottest heating pad money can buy.In efforts to remedy this heating temperament (pun intended) I turned off the “heat auto off” feature on the fob. Unfortunate that it had no affect because the promise of nonstop heat was the reason for the purchase. Regardless of the concern, which may certainly comedown to personal preference, I elected to keep the heating pad; quite a testament for my high standards. The build quality, ease of use, coverage area, very long power cord, included carrying bag, and even a free hot/cold therapeutic gel pack, all lead to a bargain at the $24.00 price I paid. While my search continues for a heating pad with nonstop heat, I may have to come to terms with the facts. In today’s world of ever diligent safety features and policies seeking to ensure the common consumer is safeguarded against self-inflicted injury, my efforts may be in vain.

About 15 minutes or so later I noticed it very quickly cool off as if I had turned it off. It remained slightly warm... very slightly. I started to wonder if it was the auto shutoff but again it had only been about 15 minutes. I re-read all if the instructions to make sure that I didn't miss anything. I hadn't. I thought maybe it was just an off day. But, nope. Every single time I use it, it heats up beautifully and very quickly, but 15-20 mins later it decides it no longer wants to give you wonderful relief and cools just as quickly as it heated up to lukewarm just as if you had switched the heat to lower than low.

Upon first pulling it out of the box, I was impressed. This is soft, not like the plastic types that are commonly sold. Yes those may be cheaper, but who wants to rest against a hot piece of plastic with a flimsy cover? THIS pad is awesome. Its cozy like a snuggle blanket and warms up in seconds. With 6 different heat settings you can have full control over what you want. The only thing is that the cord attachment to the blanket is a bit bulky if you sitting in a chair it kind of drapes over the shoulder unless you turn it around I suppose. With the long cord you CAN adjust the blanket to suit where that cord attachment rests. .. so no big deal. It does detach from the blanket and this allows you to roll everything up in the tote it comes with.The cover is beautiful, like a soft plush.It also looks modern, not like something sitting around in a nursing home cabinet.So for young or old,  I highly suggest this warm heating pad to relax the stress away or relieve muscle aches and pains.

I had a smaller one but it just wasn't cutting it. I'm a small type person (5'5"", 140 lbs) and it basically wraps around my whole back for that sweet heat relief. I was suffering extreme back pain after surgery and used heat for two weeks to survive. If I was forced to choose between them, I would have picked the heating pad over the Motrin I'd been prescribed. The Motrin did nothing, but this pad helped me relax and sleep.Pros: A nice long cord. Auto shut off. Huge size covers most of the back on smaller people. Six heat settings.Cons: None, I love this thing so much. I would say ""more heat"" (I ran it at the highest setting intermittently for days) but I'm sure there's some potential for burns if it gets hotter, and other humans who are not cold-blooded like me would probably not enjoy it.And big plus, despite foolishly ignoring the directions and falling asleep on top of it multiple times, I did not set fire to myself. I don't recommend that as a safe use of the heating pad (sleeping and/or lying on it), but it is good to know that it is well-made enough it can stand a little accidental misuse.My only regret is that I didn't have this in the hospital with me. The hospital gave me janky little heating plastics, those small packets, that do almost nothing and cover two inches of your body. My husband ran out at midnight to get me the only heating pad left at CVS, which was a ""mini-pad"" and about, say, 1/5 the size of this one.

Unfortunately, most of them are stiff so you can't really wrap them around an arm or leg, and they're a little on the small side for the back. I was attracted to this pad because it says it's soft, and for its larger size.Let me tell you, this is the BEST heating pad I have ever owned. It is soft - not just the cover, which is soft to the touch - but it is pliable, without a plastic covering inside. The pad is as wide as a standard size pillow, so it easily covers the entire back, either from side to side, or from top to bottom. They do have a size larger if you need that - I believe it's about $10 more.The heat control has 6 levels, which lets you set it more to your liking. One problem I've always had with the cheap models is that medium isn't warm enough, and hot is too hot. This pad does get quite hot, however. I rarely turn it above 3, and have never set it above 4 - that would just be too hot for me. I do love that it heats up right away, and the heat is evenly distributed across the pad.The controller has large buttons, and a large display, which is nice. The only problem - and this is what made me subtract a star - is that the controller's buttons have no background light. This means that, if you're using it at night, you can't see it at all. In fact, besides the tiny red LED that lets you know it's on, there is no light until you press a button, and then the display lights up for a moment. This is made more problematic by the fact that the buttons aren't really organically placed. The power button isn't the bottom button (see the pictures), and none of the buttons a little bump or something that might let you know where your fingers are. In fact, the evenly tapered shape of the controller means you can't even tell which way is up in the dark.All in all, I do recommend this heating pad. I've been using it for about 6 weeks now, and I love it - you know, except for the fumbling with the buttons thing.",This is the BEST heating pad I have ever owned,Color: BlueVerified Purchase,,"2,025",446.0,Public,5319.0

No product has 100% satisfaction.  So, before writing this review, I used it for a month.  Hard use, I am thinking.  Most heating pads say specifically to ""place on top"" of muscles and not underneath.  But, I lean against mine for back and hip issues.  Further, I do not like continuous heat, believing that On/Off heat is more effective for relief.  So, I have used this pad every night and almost all weekend days, turning it up to level 3 or 4 (depending on how many layers of clothing I have on), then turning it off after 15 minutes or so.  Then, repeat.  Level 4 is as high as I can go and I only use that sparingly, when I have on multiple layers.  Be aware that once your body adjusts to the temperature, you don't, ""feel it"", but the pad is still producing heat.  I am a large person and the pad is still in good form, not bunched up.  And, the cord is long enough that I don't need an extension.

However, this happened after 3 years of use and like I mentioned, countless flights and traveling so I may have twisted a wire.

When it first arrived, we were delighted.  It's very soft and a nice size and heated evenly.  We handled it carefully even though the instructions don't call for such treatment.
