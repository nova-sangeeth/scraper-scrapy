So, I ran 2 gallons of water through the water system in the refrigerator thinking maybe it needs a break in period. Mind you the family has been using the new filter through the refrigerator for about a week now.  Still only 243 PPM. Thank I took the same water from the refrigerator and ran it through the ZERO water filter, and you know what the test stick came back with 000 PPM.So, this filter is a total scam. I don’t think most will go fare to test to see if the filter is working like I did. But for $45 I needed to make sure it works. But it failed miserably. I would have been happy if it came back with 150 PPM, but only a 23-point change heck no. I sent it back.

I have a big household, a family of five with two dogs, our daily water need is quite high. The water flow with filter 1 is time-consuming to fill a cup of water, especially when everybody gets home around the same time and all want some ice water. Therefore, I recommend any household over four to purchase a water filter system rather than rely on the filtered water through the refrigerator. We recently switched to an under sink Waterdrop reverse osmosis water filtration system. Though it is pricy to purchase in the first place, the system definitely satisfied our water need and the replacement filters are also affordable considering the filter life and replace frequency. The system is also quite stylish and only takes very little space. I use the filtered water to make coffee and fresh OJs for my family in the morning and they all love it. I think the major reason is that the system reduces a great percentage of TDS in the original water, which the water after filtration is not that “hard.”I used to find those ugly white scale deposits pile up on my kettle, but I do not have to deal with it anymore with the help of this RO system.",Good product but expensive,Verified Purchase,107 people found this helpful

Anything above 200 ppm is considered hazardous. Here in Washington, DC, the water typically falls between 167-182 ppm. When I first received the filter, it tested at an astronomical 1132 ppm. After running 4-6 gallons of water through the filter per instructions from the manufacturer (instructions I called to receive), the lowest I could get the ppm was 137. I thought I had a faulty filter, so I had requested a replacement, but I faced the same issue. It is deeply concerning to me that innocent people might be drinking this ""filtered"" water, believing the water to be clean, when the mineral content continues to test so high. I have simultaneously been testing bottled water, which every time has tested at zero (yay) and Brita filters, which are testing currently around 33 (still far better). First, I would say it is CRITICAL that consumers follow the instructions due to the extremely toxic water that will initially come through the filter -- remember it was 1,132 ppm and 200 ppm and above is considered hazardous. Second, I personally believe that having to run 4 to 6 GALLONS through the filter before it is said to work is rather extreme. I broke it down over two days because my dispenser isn't particularly fast flowing, so even conducting half of that amount took me an hour. Third, it ultimately did NOT filter the water, which is frightening. I am removing the filter completely and returning it for a refund, because drinking the tap is essentially the same, saves us $50, and removes the possibility of toxic exposure from the contents of the filter. I do believe this should be looked at more closely, because not everyone is actively testing the water and is relying on the company's word that water using this filter should be around 4 ppm (that is what I was told at least on a phone call with the company). On a positive note, the team at EveryDrop were wonderful and courteous, and I rather enjoyed working with them. They were as shocked as I was by the water testing results.","WARNING - When tested, this filter yields hazardous levels of PPM",Verified Purchase,35 people found this helpful

The water would not stop so I had a mini flood growing in the kitchen. I finally thought to put the old filter in and finally stopped the flow. I have reached out to Every Drop, Whirlpool ,and Pur to see if anyone can advise as to what filter I should buy as this is junk. I don't trust buying an Every Drop again. I read in these reviews that Pur used to supply the Every Drop filter but then started using a different brand and that's why the fittings don't load properly and that the length of the filter prevents the door from closing well. I'm hoping Pur actually has the filters that used their tech even tho Every Drop name is on the filters they sell on their site. My next call is to the store where I bought the fridge. Maybe they have had to deal with the repair problems caused by this filter and can rec a different one.

I will also add pics of the first filter, current filter (w/probs), and new Whirlpool filter for folks to be able to compare. Every Drop and PUR told  me to contact Whirlpool. I asked them to tell me specifically where I could buy a quality filter (as in the past) that would fit and both again referred me to Whirlpool.

I then noticed the one I bought here had lots of stains on it as well. After weighing it, the Whirlpool one, and the one I had previously bought from here, I am convinced that the most recent one I bought from here was used. It weighed more than the other 2, was even dirty whereas the one I replaced was still clean looking. I personally think Amazon should shut down this seller for safety reasons. They lure you in w/a good filter and when you return to buy another, God knows what is in that filter, where it was used, potential diseases, etc. The filter that started all this mess must have messed up the filter line bc now I am having issues where there is air in the line, water won't stop flowing, etc. and this is a 1 yr old fridge so I am hoping Amazon will allow the truth to stay in my review.",Caused a mini flood,Verified Purchase,25 people found this helpful

I installed the new filter and ran a few gallons of water as directed with no issues.  The next day the fridge started making a loud noise when dispensing water.

These are about 1/16 "" shorter. (I couldn't verify this claim though as I do not have an old PUR filter to compare with).  The filter door is causing the filter to not seat all the way into the filter housing for a tight seal.

Now 2 weeks later and the family using the water dispenser the water tests about 20 ppm less than tap water.  May tap tests at 340 ppm give or take 15 depending on the day.  I also tested demineralized water which came in at 3 ppm and bottled Dasani water which was 15 ppm.AN ABSOLUTE AND COMPLETE RIPOFF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF TRUSTING CUSTOMERS!!!

I have never had a leak with a real Whirlpool filter.One problem I had this last time, which others have had, is that after the initial purge of 3 gallons, after a short while the water would start to trickle and then stop. Nothing. I read about air in the line, so I followed the instructions of dispensing water for 5 seconds, then waiting again for another 5 seconds before resuming, and repeating countless times. What a pain! But it continued to have the problem. After a few dispenses, the water would stop flowing.  I found that if I removed the filter and snapped it back in, it would work for a few times, but the water not coming from the dispenser would just keep on coming back, until it hardly worked at all.I figured there was air in the FILTER. So, I washed the exterior well, and then submerged it in a deep container full of water (I washed it so that any dirt or contamination would enter the filter). Sure enough, I could see air very slowly popping out of one of the two opening. A small bubble, then pop, then another, then another.  I left it submerged for several hours until I was sure that I saw no more bubbles (I would also occasionally agitate it to help the air escape).  I then reinstalled it, and it has worked flawlessly ever since.So, if you have the same problem, that would be my suggestion.UPDATE: This worked for a good while, and then the same issue. Somehow air keeps on infiltrating the filter and causing stoppage of the water flow. Take it out and water flower perfectly. Very frustrating to do this every week or two.",How I fixed the problem with these filters causing water stoppage- for a while!,Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

I found sites and forums where people had had similar questions (apparently, this is a thing?) and did not know when they should change the filter.

After a few years of using the non-Whirlpool brands it was very clear that those filters were not exact spec filters as they would technically fit the connectors but there was always some odd thing.  The filters would be a 1/4"" too long, wouldn't have the same water flow spec, cheap filter elements, etc.  But, for the cost I didn't care.  Fast forward to now and it seems as if Whirlpool has been successful at shutting down some (not all) of these knockoff filters.  So, I was forced to buy the Whirlpool filter, and, I have to admit the more expensive filter is head and shoulders better.  The water flow is *much* better, the filter material is better and the filter itself is an exact and precise fit.

First and foremost you are not buying this filter to remove TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) you need a RO/RODI (Reverse osmosis) filter unit in order to remove TDS. At the most this filter is a sediment filter (removes undissolved solids) to a point and then uses a carbon block to remove other chemicals from the water (ex: Chlorine, smells, taste, etc.) Overall just makes the water a bit healthier and cleaner with a “better” taste apposed to tap. Also helps prevent larger particles from building up in the fridge without removing 100% of everything in the water. Again research RODI units if you want 100% “clean, 0 TDS” water.Other then that it does have a good taste to the water.My biggest complaint is the cost. On average they last 6 months at $50 not on sale that’s approx $8.35 a month excluding tax. For a water filter. Compared to other filter styles that don’t fit this filter. I personally plan on letting the fridge bypass the filter and doing my own DIY filter in-line before it gets to the fridge.

Then I bought the filter on this site, put it in and worked great again but only for about 2 months and it has now slowed to a dribble and we have been using way less water.  If at all possible I would like a replacement sent, else I will be buying my next filter's from somewhere else.  Also, after reading reviews see I am not the only one having this issue, and thus my writing a review.  Stop sending out defective filters!",Defective Filter's from this site,Verified Purchase,
