In a nutshell:1.) Power it up.2.) Connect Ethernet cable from modem to laptop and go to xfinity.com/activate3.) All you need to do is login like you're about to pay a bill and that's it - no account numbers or anything!4.) CALL XFINITY TO ACTIVATE YOUR EQUIPMENT!!! Do not skip this step!5.) Tell them the Serial Number and MAC Address (DOCSIS 3.1, not the DOCSIS 3.0 - look closely on the unit, not on the box, there are (2) MAC addresses, provide the 3.1 number).6.) Connect modem to router via Ethernet (Cat 6 minimum), connect phone line,  and you're gucci.Literally all those steps took me less than 15 minutes, including the call to XFinity.I had been wanting to switch to my own modem and start saving $11 per month (plus taxes) for a while, and finally decided to go for it. I hated paying the rental and then I also found out another little detail, you know that free XFinity hotspot thing they keep talking about, ever wonder where that comes from, that's right, your rental modem/router. That sucker is turned on by default and XFinity is using your electricity to power up a public XFinity hotspot. Totally lame, I killed it ASAP in the XFinity My Account application as soon as I realized that. Next thing I did with the rental was turn off the WiFi by switching the unit into Bridge mode. Just some advice for people still renting. I highly recommend switching to bridge and using your own router, it's way better than theirs. Better yet, buy your own modem and route. Ok, rant over, back to review.It is easily two times, if not three times smaller than the rental modem/router unit. Kinda goes as a given since it's one device replacing two. And to that point, it is better to have two discrete devices than two devices in one package for reliability and ease of diagnosis. The device is also very discrete looking and sufficiently aesthetic, at least to me, to be in plain sight. Overall, the build quality, construction, and overall perception does seem to line up with the price tag. I feel like I'm getting my money's worth for the time being. Reliability will ultimately solidify or uproot that.It boots up way quicker than the rental (~1-2 min) and performs better. The latency on my speed tests went down from 12-15 to about 7-9ms aand I'm getting just slightly better downloads but not by much. However, this is one of two of the only XFinity approved DOCSIS 3.1 modems - think up to 10Gbps connection. Now I'm on blast - 250mbps (getting all 250 and then some) but am thinking of going to 1Gbps. And while we're dreaming,  this modem will do 2Gbps with link aggregation, but the software update is still in the works. Basically two Ethernet cables from your modem going to your router, each 1Gbps but acting like a ""single"" cable to provide 2Gbps of total throughput. Way out of the league of most people, but XFinity does have a 2Gbps option over coax so I figured I'd throw it out there.I have only had it for a few days, but was so thrilled with the easy set-up and exceptional performance, I decided to leave a review. I will update ofcourse over the years with reliability and how it holds up, but so far, very promising.",Best 3.1 DOCSIS Modem for XFinity,Style: 2000Mbps Max Download w/VoiceVerified Purchase,139 people found this helpful

Tested by connecting it directly modem to desktop and was getting same speed dropping. I have Blast (250MB/s DL & 10MB UL/s) speed from Xfinity Comcast, with the old modem didn't see speed higher than 135MB/s DL. That wasn't bad until it started to failed, then I realized that it has not been my IP fault I wasn't getting the full 250MB/s, it was me with an older modem with top DL of 175MB/s capable. I started to research to see what modem to buy and since I already have the router Netgear NightHawk X10 and no problem, I look into netgear modem and read the awesome review this one has, so I decided to go for it.

In addition they were deprived of one of the most valuable human needs: WiFi. Read on if you want to read a story of hope, heartache, and restoration. tl;dr this Netgear modem sucks.I bought this one because my Xfinity Double Play (150 Mbps internet + Cable) package expired and was charging me $60 more in fees. Calling Xfinity, they were able to lower my bill. Double Play and Triple Play happened to be the same price with current promotions. Thinking I was getting a good deal I signed up for the Triple Play not knowing that I would need a new modem (shame on me), as I was on an older DOCSIS 3.0 modem w/o voice support, and Xfinity was unable to finalize my order until I installed a modem that could handle voice.I was NOT going to pay the $13/month to rent their modem, so I decided to jump online and grab this one. I was ecstatic that it was arriving the next day! That was the only good thing about this whole story. I set it up and had the WORST time trying to get it to activate. The connection from the Ethernet port to the laptop was laughably slow. I had to refresh 10 times and wait for the next page to load through the activation process, hoping it wouldn't timeout and lose my progress. It finally went through and was able to activate the new modem. This should have been a huge red flag, but I tend to slog through problems and apparently am a glutton for punishment. Read on.Fool me once: The issue is that the internet was a tease. It would come online for a few minutes and then disconnect for 5+ minutes. You never really knew when it would come back online or for how long. Then it would come back online, then go off again. I called Comcast but they were only able to send a reset signal to the modem once in every 2 calls. It was an awful experience, especially for someone who has to work from home a couple days a week.Fool me twice: I finally identified that the major change that caused the issue was the modem, so I decided to replace the original one for a new one. Amazon is awesome and sent one within 2 days. I was eager to get the one ""fluke"" modem out of here and install the new one. After another call with Comcast, they were able to activate the new one. It seemed to be working great with amazing speeds... until it didn't. Internet started going wonky and once again I was being subjected to the schizophrenic connection.After wasting valuable time trying to get this thing to work, I finally called Comcast and asked them to move me back to Double Play and re-activated my old modem, the trusty Surfboard, and haven't had an internet connection issue since.During this whole ordeal I was on the phone with Comcast at least 10 times, for a total of 3.5 hours, not including the couple hours trying to troubleshoot, power cycle, etc.Now that I think of it, I recall in the past having Netgear modems before my Surfboard and had to RMA them every 6-12 months because they would crap out. After a power cycle they'd work for a bit, then go back to spotty internet. Seems like they never fixed those issues even after all these years. If you've made it this far, you must also be a glutton for punishment. Please don't punish yourself by buying this modem.

So I opted to get a new modem and a new router so that I could have better control of the devices.  This device was easy enough to set up. Once I installed it I tried to use Comcast's useless self install feature. It kept asking me if I wanted to bring over the old wifi settings as if this were a router. So it wouldn't let me specify that it's just a modem. So I had to call support directly. I had the guy change me over in their system (he commented that this is a great modem and that lots of customers are getting them) and then I waited the usual 10-15 minutes for it to start working. So far I've had it over a month and it hasn't needed a single reboot. Download speeds from Comcast are rated at 250Mb's but with this modem my speed test hits about 300 every time.,So I opted to get a new modem and a new router so that I could have better control of the devices,Style: 1000Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,223 people found this helpful

Thinking I was getting a good deal I signed up for the Triple Play not knowing that I would need a new modem (shame on me), as I was on an older DOCSIS 3.0 modem w/o voice support, and Xfinity was unable to finalize my order until I installed a modem that could handle voice.I was NOT going to pay the $13/month to rent their modem, so I decided to jump online and grab this one. I was ecstatic that it was arriving the next day! That was the only good thing about this whole story. I set it up and had the WORST time trying to get it to activate. The connection from the Ethernet port to the laptop was laughably slow. I had to refresh 10 times and wait for the next page to load through the activation process, hoping it wouldn't timeout and lose my progress. It finally went through and was able to activate the new modem. This should have been a huge red flag, but I tend to slog through problems and apparently am a glutton for punishment. Read on.Fool me once: The issue is that the internet was a tease. It would come online for a few minutes and then disconnect for 5+ minutes. You never really knew when it would come back online or for how long. Then it would come back online, then go off again. I called Comcast but they were only able to send a reset signal to the modem once in every 2 calls. It was an awful experience, especially for someone who has to work from home a couple days a week.Fool me twice: I finally identified that the major change that caused the issue was the modem, so I decided to replace the original one for a new one. Amazon is awesome and sent one within 2 days. I was eager to get the one ""fluke"" modem out of here and install the new one. After another call with Comcast, they were able to activate the new one. It seemed to be working great with amazing speeds... until it didn't. Internet started going wonky and once again I was being subjected to the schizophrenic connection.After wasting valuable time trying to get this thing to work, I finally called Comcast and asked them to move me back to Double Play and re-activated my old modem, the trusty Surfboard, and haven't had an internet connection issue since.During this whole ordeal I was on the phone with Comcast at least 10 times, for a total of 3.5 hours, not including the couple hours trying to troubleshoot, power cycle, etc.Now that I think of it, I recall in the past having Netgear modems before my Surfboard and had to RMA them every 6-12 months because they would crap out. After a power cycle they'd work for a bit, then go back to spotty internet. Seems like they never fixed those issues even after all these years. If you've made it this far, you must also be a glutton for punishment. Please don't punish yourself by buying this modem.

So it wouldn't let me specify that it's just a modem. So I had to call support directly. I had the guy change me over in their system (he commented that this is a great modem and that lots of customers are getting them) and then I waited the usual 10-15 minutes for it to start working.

I myself don't know a whole lot about modems, but I suspect what's malfunctioning is either the modulator or the demodulator (incidentally where the name modem comes from; MODulator and DEmodulator, swap the letters D & E), the parts that turn the signal you get from your ISP into data your computer can read, thus giving it its connection, and vice versa.if you buy this modem, it will eventually fail. we turned it on for the first time on May 31st, and it failed yesterday, July 9th.

I highly recommend the Nighthawk routers, they are great.we had to bust out our old Arris one and I am on the hunt for a replacement for this Netgear one. the Arris one is doing a fine job for now. my bf originally had it for his Cox connection where we used to live and it served him well. he plays games like DOTA 2, Fortnite, League of Legends, Rocket League etc so he needs a good connection. we have two people hardwired to our internet using our router as a switch to support the dual ethernet connections since most standard consumer modems only have one ethernet port.run far away from this modem. the second star is ONLY because while the modem was alive, it performed perfectly. if not for the fatal overheating flaw and subsequent hardware fail, this modem would be fantastic. it allowed us 240mbps down with our 200mbps plan from Spectrum.",be cautious when buying this modem - heed the warnings from the rest of us,Style: 300Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,49 people found this helpful

It was a modem that had 4 ethernet ports!  What a solution to my home network.  The older construction of my home requires hardwired connections to be reliable internet service.  I have a finished basement whose walls are concrete, so the wifi doesn't work well and if there is any load needed for processing or game play, it HAS to be hardwired.  So here I thought I had the solution!  I could take the main lines we use and connect them to this modem (4 ports: 3 computers and then the router be placed in the other room).  What a solution to the wifi integrity to have the router in the another, more centralized room of the house and then be able to supply wifi to phones, tablets and laptops as well as hardwire a computer, DVD player or other device.  NOPE, you CAN'T use the other ports that way.  You MUST plug the router in the first port and  then NONE of the other hardwired cables would work in the other 3 ports!  So why did I pay for the other 3 ports??  They are functional for something, I'm not sure what, but they DO NOT allow a simple hardwired computer to be attached to them.

Why on earth would I pay you more to confirm that your product is a piece of junk??  Highly dissatisfied.  I will never purchase another Netgear product.

If you have the triple play (TV, Internet, voice) plan with XFINITY and you are excited about not paying rental fees to Xfinity, this is your only modem choice for now until another manufacturer can make a better device. First unit I ordered came really fast. Setup is super easy. I provisioned it using xfinity.com/activate and was able to enter my account information and have the automated system do its job. I was up and running in less than 10 minutes after plugging it in. It's important to first plug a cat6 cable directly from the modem to a test computer to see the connection speeds. This first unit I got was extremely disappointing since I was expecting close to gigabit speeds. It was hitting a peak maximum of 200Mbps and my OLD data plan was able to get 400Mbps from the previous modem that was only DOCSIS 3.0. I had an xfinity technician come over to verify all the signals and connections and validated that the incoming signal was strong enough for gigabit speed. He isolated the issue to this Netgear CM1150v modem. I contacted NETGEAR themselves and they had me go through the same routine troubleshooting. Soft reset. Hard reset. Nothing worked. There is no firmware to update since that is not even an option on this device. I have initiated a replacement/return with Amazon.

The other 3 ports are apparently for some ethereal future use. Probably vaporware that will never materialize.• Each time you switch the single device you can have linked to this modem, you must completely power down the modem for at least 10 seconds and restart the modem (some call this process recycling) or the device will not obtain an IP address.Lacking this information caused me to spend multiple hours on many calls with smart and kind Xfinity agents featuring an amazing diversity of difficult-to-understand accents. I just wanted to set this modem up like my old one; with one router and my work laptop directly wired to it.It took three long phone calls just to get the modem fully registered on my Xfinity account and to get the Xfinity Voice feature working. But no matter what we tried, the modem we linked to the router failed to obtain an IP address. My work laptop got an IP address, but the modem did not. After a little online research, I figured that my 3½-year-old modem must have gone the way of all the earth. So I ran out and bought a new modem, only to find that it also failed to obtain an IP address.While some of the Xfinity agents claimed deep knowledge of this modem, at no point did any of them seem to realize that only one Ethernet port could be used at a time. Online discussion threads suggest that many have spent hours on the phone with Netgear to discover this crucial information. As soon as I realized this was an issue, I disconnected my laptop so that only the router was linked to the modem, but the router still failed to obtain an IP address.Xfinity ended up arranging for a technician to come to my house, but another Xfinity agent later called to see if we could fix the issue without a physical visit. After that didn't work, I finally found an obscure discussion thread online that said you had to recycle the modem after switching devices or the new device would not obtain an IP address. Sure enough, following this procedure caused the modem to obtain an IP address. I kept my old modem and returned the new one.Despite the horrible process of getting the modem fully functional for our needs, I have to say that it works great. Our download speeds have literally doubled. If this modem lasts more than four years, as did our last one, we will have saved nearly $300 by owning rather than renting the cable modem.So go ahead and buy this modem for your Xfinity needs. But directly wire only your main networking device (router) to it. If you ever switch routers, make sure to fully recycle the modem so that the router will obtain an IP address.

Over the past 3 years, using their Arris TM1602A modem, I have been frustrated with buffering, when streaming, slow downloads, etc. speed checking, off and on, I would notice speeds as low as in the 100s gbps up to the 300s. I never had hit 400gbps from what I observed. From the provider I would get excuses from copper exposed connectors creating antennas and draining the function to using too many devices to wireless products and so on. I accepted those excuses until I heard a tech person, from a different provider, talking about how their provider throttles the speed in the modems they provide along with monitoring what you use it for... I use it for basic use, from tv shows, live tv and movies (no, not porn) along with gaming and internet use... basic stuff as far as I'm concerned. I do not know if the provider does as I heard, however I wanted to take the chance an see if it is a solution... after all I can always return it with amazon. I did and had a problem. On the modems they install for you, there is this connection between the coax cable and modem, a filter or something. make sure you use it!!! Other than that, make sure your coax cable is not the cheap stuff and you are good to go. I was able to connect by internet (takes a few minutes when new modem connects) with web site address netgear provides. At first the connection is slow - I checked and was told it takes 24-48 hours for full speed for whatever BS reason. Note, if you don't see an improvement soon to a reset on modem (push in button that you need a paperclip for) and restart your router (I use netgear x10) and computer. I saw improvements quickly increase within the 12-24 hour period. Since hook up from 2 days ago this is the numbers I am getting (see picture). I am not a tech geek and was hesitant but this was fairly painless and now I no longer need to lease a provider controlled modem that costs $10 a month that you generally talk to a automated response when you have problems.

It is also vulnerable to a critical exploit which can potentially leave your network open to others.I originally chose the CM1000 because I had a great history with my CM600. Throughout the years I owned the CM600, the device never needed reboots, and my signal quality was great. It is currently serving as a modem at my parents home.Now that I have gigabit internet, I needed a more powerful modem. The CM1000 disappointed me with the build quality. The base is made of plastic and feels very cheap and wobbly. I also think having a thin and wide plastic base looks less than appealing, but most people won’t be looking at their modem, so it isn’t a huge dealbreaker. The CM1000 has lesser specs than the competing 3.1 modems however, and this was very noticeable. The modem homepage loaded extremely slow, and during the 2 weeks that the modem was working, the connection was not always perfect.I gave up on the modem after having completely lost connection to my isp. Upon further research into troubleshooting, I found out that this modem is susceptible to a vulnerability known as “Cable Haunt.” This is a critical security exploit which can potentially give an attacker control of your modem. This issue is made worse due to the fact that firmware updates are pushed out by ISP’s, and not every internet provider will update modem firmware. I was stuck with a modem that wasn’t currently operational, and one that had a security exploit that wouldn’t be fixed as my ISP (Suddenlink) does not push out firmware updates.My solution was to switch to the MB8600, which has much better build quality, a surge protector on the coaxial input, more RAM, and is not currently listed as being vulnerable to the Cable Haunt exploit.",CM1000 modem,Style: 1000Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,9 people found this helpful

It's a real shame because in the 10+ years I've purchased my own modems (just two prior to this one) I've never had one fail before, let alone fail in just three months of use.Everything worked exactly as expected from when I received it on January 18th, 2020. It was only a few days ago when, out of nowhere, the modem just stopped working as intended. In summary, it could download content, but uploading became very inconsistent, thus making video conferencing all but impossible. On top of that, the overall connection became spotty at best, working for a few hours before completely staying dead for another few hours.Given the shelter-in-place order my state is in right now, not being able to effectively work from home without a reliable internet connection was completely unacceptable.Of course I blamed Comcast first.A technician came to my home yesterday (very helpful, knowledgeable, and a DIY PC builder like myself) to inspect the hard line from the street, the line from the box on the side of my house to where it directly connects to the modem, and the modem itself. They upgrading some cabling in the box, but other than that the signal strength for them was strong and healthy. After several repeated attempts to get the modem to work, the conclusion was that the modem itself was at fault. After weighing the options and examining the evidence, I decided to accept their XB6 modem as a replacement.I'm REALLY disappointed at my Netgear CM1200 modem crapping out, and so early into its life.

Word of caution if you are an existing Comcast/Xfinity customer replacing your modem, don't bother with the instructions that mention to visit xfinity.com/activate to activate your equipment, it will most likely fail at the end right out of the box. To save yourself time and aggravation, do the following:1. Remove your old modem from the coaxial and attach the new CM1000 modem.2. Power it on and wait for the first 4 LED lights to go solid green (there are 5, but you won't see the fifth until you attach it to a NIC or home router)3. Attach the included Cat 5E cable to the back and plug it into a laptop or nearby PC4. Call 1-800-934-6489, go through the prompts until it connects you to the Comcast/Xfinity activation support agent.5. Say you would like to replace the modem on your account, answer the account verification questions, and have your modem MAC address handy.6. Provide the MAC address and wait for them to add it to your account and send the activation signal. They may ask you which version of the CM1000 you have, in which case answer the 1AZNAS. Once they confirm and send the activation signal, you will see the modem recycle itself a couple times before settling back on four solid green LED lights.7. The support agent should have you test the connectivity after that and if all went well, you should be up and running.8. (If you have a home router) Turn the router off/unplug it, and attach the Cat 5E/6 cable from the cable modem. Power cycle the cable modem one more time and wait for it to come fully back online with the four solid green lights. Turn on/plug the router power back in and let it fully come online as well. At this point, you will see the 5th green LED light on the modem indicating NIC connectivity and you should be good to go.NOTE: Once they properly send the correct bootfile/configuration to your modem the first time, any subsequent activations/provisioning (for instance if you move or swap modems then swap back) seem to work fine off of xfinity.com/activate.

I attempted to connect the device at home as it was replacing the CM500.  I have an AC1750 Netgear router that was connected to the CM500 and is now connected to the CM1200.  I spent 5 hours the first night working with Netgear and my ISP (Comcast) to setup the device correctly; I was unable to use the activate link and had to call Comcast.  While on the phone, Comcast stated because it's a Netgear product, Netgear would have to provide the firmware.  However, Netgear's knowledge base states Comcast actually pushes the firmware.  It started to feel like I was in the middle between Comcast and Netgear.  This should have been an easy experience - plug and play - just like I have done with many other computer hardware.Once the device was setup, it worked well for about a week.  The following Sunday I contacted Comcast again because I no longer was getting internet service.  Comcast could not see the modem.  We went through normal troubleshooting of a power cycle of both the modem and router.  Internet service resumed.  A little later, Comcast could not see the modem again.  Went through the same steps and it was back.Comcast sent a technician out on 8/18/2020.  They changed connections outside of my place.  Also pushed all the service to one cable connection in my place; all other cable wall outlets do not have cable as I'm trying to ensure all the service is going to where I am connecting my internet and TV (I've been in this place for 4 years and did not have this problem previously until recently).The following Sunday I contacted Comcast again and went through the same steps.  The following days I had to restart my modem each morning because I no longer had wifi when I got up to start work.  I contacted Comcast 8/27/2020 to further discuss the issue.  The first time we went through the normal steps of trying to restart the modem, unplug the modem, attempt to make a connection from Comcast to the modem, etc.  Internet service came back... for an hour.  An hour later I contacted Comcast again and they pointed me to Netgear.  Now I really feel like I'm between Comcast and Netgear and no one taking ownership of the problem.After speaking with Comcast on 8/27/2020, I entered a support case with Netgear.  I contacted them on 8/28/2020 because Netgear apparently does not reach out when a case is entered, it is up to the user to contact them after creating a case online.  At 4 PM on 8/28, the Netgear technician had me reset the modem, unplug the modem, unplug the router and then reconnect everything.  I explained I do this on a daily basis, but went along.  When this was done, internet service returned... as expected.  The tech said to monitor the internet for the next couple days to see if the problem persists.  I told him I know what's going to happen and that I will be contacting Netgear again before a couple days ends.  I asked if they could just send a replacement because I've been dealing with this issue for 3 weeks at this point, and he said just monitor the internet service.At 8 PM on 8/28 (4 hours after reaching Netgear) I was on the phone again with Comcast because internet service was non-existent.  At 8:30 PM I began my hour long hold with Netgear following up on my open case stating what I told the prior technician that I would be calling Netgear back because I would no longer have internet service.  We went through similar steps, however this time the technician had me change a setting on the router.I'm expecting I'll once again be contacting Comcast and Netflix on either 8/29 or 8/30 because the internet is no longer working for me.At this point, I'm caught between Comcast stating that I'm using my own device and they can't support that, and Netgear saying I have 90 days on my service warranty.  Meanwhile, I have intermittent internet issues causing me to use my mobile hotspot to work.I will say Netgear tech support has been pleasant once I get through the queue, but I've been on hold 30 to 60 minutes each time I call and then another 30 to 60 minutes troubleshooting.  I've also had to repeat many details along the way when I call, however, so that's frustrating.I'm hoping this gets resolved, or I'll have to work with Amazon to return the modem and hopefully get a full refund.","CM1200 Provides Intermittent Signal - Inconsistent Mpbs, Mostly < 100 Mbps & Frequent < 50 Mpbs",Style: 2000Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

I've always heard bad stories about how Comcast throttles and screws people over. I've been very happy with AT&T the past 20 years, albeit the fastest I could download was at 100Mbps. So I prepared myself for the worst and decided on this CM1200 in hopes of minimizing my dependance on Xfinity.Once it arrived, I plugged in the coax and waited a few minutes. I then hooked up my laptop and began the registration process. After a few speed tests, 800/900 down, I sought to enable Link Aggregation. I mean, what better way to put my new RAX120 to good use?Ports 1&2 were connected respectively from the CM1200 to the RAX120 after configuring link agg in both devices. It took a little longer for the modem to negotiate with Comcast, but it was all green lights after that. Ran a speed test and now I was getting speeds of almost 1200Mbps!After 8 months, I'm happy to report that there have been no major issues. We had several power outages and only once did I have to use the Xfinity self help website to reboot the modem. There were times where I wasn't getting the full 1.2G, but I switched to Cat 6 for the link agg and that seemed to fix it.

I was having line issues, of the 3 modems, this one had the least (none) connection issues.  The cable company repaired the issues finally, but this modem was a champ during the period of bad signal.  The arris and Motorola would disconnect constantly and never come back until power cycled.- Cheap!- Best web UI of all modemsIf you want this modem, but are lamenting the lack of LAG, Netgear does have a CM1100 which supports LAG, but its only available at Costco right now.

It advised that my service could be four times as fast with a new modem. I wasn’t sure I needed any more speed, but I shelled out the $152 for the Netgear CM1000 which had been recommended by Comcast. Although mindful of the reviewer who described a 5 minute setup, I picked a time for installation when it wouldn’t be a hassle to be without wifi for an hour. That proved to be a very low estimate.There were instructions on how to set things up for Comcast without talking to anyone. Those instructions were bogus. I got part way into the process when I got a message that things didn’t work, and that I should call a Comcast number. I messed around with the phone robot telling me to try again, but finally made contact with a person. She said she had to delete the registration of the existing modem, before she could register the new modem. After that process I had no Internet reception. After trying various things I got very fast (almost 1,000 MBPS) service on a computer hooked directly to the modem. Then I connected the modem to my Nighthawk X6  R8000 router. After multiple reboots, I got reception via the router. Wired directly to the router, the computer shosed a speed of about 500 MBPS. But the wifi speed was a pitiful 45, slower than my reception with the old modem. After over an hour on the phone with the Comcast woman, I told her I had done enough for one day. I would work on the router the next day.On the next day, I put another hour into the setup. Based on recommendations I had read, I did factory resets on the router and installed the latest firmware. There was no improvement in wifi speed. Since I seldom use a computer directly connected to the router, I have received no improvement from the new moden. I sure I will blow some time doing more messing with the router.

I am talking about the Nighthawk Cable Modem with Voice CM1150V. (I wish Amazon did not do this!)- Pricey. I got it on sale but, it is still at the top price level for a non wi-fi cable modem.- Forget about what seems to be the ethernet jacks on the back. The Amazon and even the Netgear descriptions are wrong. The extra ethernet jacks are “reserved” for future aggregation of ethernet. Which happens via a business level router. IOW: for an office or high traffic/large file use situation.Why Netgear did not offer customers the option to make those ports a switch router in the mean time, is bonkers. Sure, maybe it is not technically possible as it is now so, the engineers should have made it technically possible when they designed the dang thing! Alternatively, sell a version for home, but with actual ports for a typical home network.The information I could find as to if Comcast (across USA) could even meet the requirements of this device remains unclear.  Comcast is terrible at keeping its information house in order.- Many parts of the Netgear web site seemed to have been phoned in and are minimal or have errors too.- Netgear only has technical support centers overseas. As usual, they are awful. Techs can't speak English without making errors; can't understand American conversational English; and generally do not know the product. When I asked if I could connect to a US call center (simply to speed it up and have CLEAR information), they said no. Not possible. (In contrast, Amazon does this transfer if you ask, thankfully, saving its customers hours of long useless conversations to nowhere. When Amazon stops doing that, it will be the day I stop being a customer — since 1995!)- All above is pretty much a deal killer for me on this one. I am probably returning it but, finding a suitable replacement has been a challenge. I'd like a DOCIS 3.1 24x8 or higher with voice or a DOCSIS 3.0 24x8 with voice. Both for less than $150.

Actually, that Moto might just be 3.0… so worse…I may have to stick with paying way more than I want to Fios… These regional cable monopolies and duopolies we all suffer through in the USA need to end!","CM1150V: more for business & for techies, not for regular home broadband users",Style: 2000Mbps Max Download w/VoiceVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

The tech I got at Comcast was surprisingly helpful and knowledgable, but had to go into some backend tool to add the -1AZNAS designation to the SKU to get it to work - but it does now work.

Installation was on par with any other modem – connect the wires, quick setup, and activate with Xfinity. The problem was inconsistent, and at times, awful performance. When connected to a router that had been reliably connecting at 50 to 80 Mbps, with my old modem, this device often cut the signal to less than 10 Mbps.I’ve been happy with multiple Netgear routers in the past and realize that tech devices can be hit or miss when they are mass-produced. The real issue with this purchase was Netgear itself.I called the support line, and after holding for an agent, he had me reboot and quickly told me it was an ISP issue and to call Xfinity. Spoiler alert: The Netgear agent turned out to be wrong.After long but productive troubleshooting call with Xfinity, we ruled out any line or compatibility issues. Switching between the 2 modems pinned the quality issues on the Netgear device with packet loss of 14-20% (over 5-10% is significant).My next call with Netgear to get a warranty exchange was worse than the first. The rep provided inconsistent and very misleading information. My first questions were whether the replacement would be a new device and if I would have to pay shipping in either direction. The agent said that I would get a “working” replacement and that there was a “zero cost” exchange option. When pressed, she said the replacement would be refurbished that I had to pay for return shipping with “zero cost” option. If I wanted a refurbished unit, I could have bought one for less money instead of paying for new PLUS shipping. When I asked her to escalate the call, she said her manager was busy but would call me in “4 or 5 hours.” That would have been after 11pm so she promised that I would get a call the next day. That was 3 days ago and still no callback.My take is that Netgear support will say anything to clear their call queue and company doesn’t fully stand behind its products. I actually got better support from the cable company. Think about that.I wound up returning it to Amazon with zero hassle and paid a few bucks more for TP-Link modem with better specs. I’ve had good luck with a recently-purchased TP-Link router and am hoping for the same with their modem.

I hope to upgrade to the Gig-tier service once Spectrum allows it in my area for customer-owned modems. As of right now in Jan 2019 though, they only allow Gig service on a modem that they provide you (the Technicolor 4400). That's okay though. For now, my 400mbps-tier is working just fine with this CM1000, and I don't have to deal with a modem lease from Spectrum this way.

Note that this doesn't include a router. I think it makes it cheaper, and if you have your own router already you wont have to worry about de-activating (activating?) ""bridge mode"".  I have an eero wifi router mesh system so didn't need this to have a router built in.2. This does accommodate voice connection. Many routers don't, including some of the Netgear options within this same product listing, so make sure you select one that has voice if you need it for your VOIP service.3. I have Comcast/Xfinity. It could have been an easy setup, but I missed one step. This cost me hours. To activate Comcast, once you have the modem plugged into power, the round cable thing connected, and the phone jack connected, you are supposed to connect your computer to the modem with an ethernet cable plugged into the TOP ethernet port in the modem. This is apparently the only one that works. Close all browsers then open a fresh one and you'll automatically get instructions from Comcast about how to activate. The modem reboots itself when activated and you see all the lights turn on and become solid. Here's where I screwed up. You need to take your computer's ethernet cable out of the modem and then plug your router's cable into that same port.  (I had plugged it into one of the other ports, which, again, don't work).  THEN, you have to re-boot it all: unplug your router from power (or however you shut it down), turn off the Netgear modem. Then turn each on again, in sequence. (However, I don't remember if it was modem first then router, or the other way around! Just try each). The Comcast instructions never mention that you need to remove your computer's ethernet, nor do they discuss re-booting. Those were the clinchers for me.4. This doesn't have a backup battery so when the power goes out, it goes out. With many modems, you can buy a separate little battery that will buy you some time. With this modem, you have to buy a separate ""uninterrupted power supply,"" which is like a power strip that will operate for a period of time without power.",A few tips...,Style: 2000Mbps Max Download w/VoiceVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

The Netgear router is model: WGR614 v9. I tried calling Xfinity to give me the information I needed first, but was told that because the router is customer owned, I would have to speak with Netgear. That they (Netgear) were the only one who has access to the IPv4 address. Comcast had access to only the IPv6 address and nothing else. So, I called Netgear's customer support and was able to speak with a representative after about an hour of waiting.

Unfortunately, no solution came from that attempt. Ultimately, Netgear said that because my router was manufactured 1 year ago, it was considered obsolete and was no longer supported.

Where the Rep will be speaking with a thick accent , and my Va. accent was not helping either. So, I found out even though I had not had the Router longer than a month , it had 2 Firmware Updates that were not installed.  Mind you the NetGear App you download on your Smart Phone has an Update Check to do for you.  This does not function. It will say NO UPDATES at this time available.  Even though I was 2 firmware updates behind. It looks like NetGear would have sent me a current firmware on this Router . No worries though, if you're up to 2 hrs. of Tech Assistance with someone in Baliwood . You will have to use your Lap Top, Desk Top , connected ( hard wired) with an Ethernet Cable directly to your Router, and start browsing for your Router IP address in 1 window and then open another window to go to your Netgear acct and download the current Firmware to your Desktop , Documents, etc. and go to the other window where you have your Advanced Tab and try try try to get it to update, I had given up and finally Rebooted the system and when it came back up it had the current firmware downloaded. Thank you Jesus . This appears  that it has corrected the Hard Power off every 3 days, or so.  So it was the out of date firmware causing the frustration.

I started having intermittent internet issues a few months ago, after owning this modem for almost a year. The modem would just stop talking to my internet provider, until I rebooted it. The status page said everything is OK. I went through many troubleshooting steps - replacing all my coaxial lines and testing for noise (no problems) - replacing my ethernet cables - moving the modem to where it has more airflow/cooling - etc - and still the problem persisted. I must conclude that the modem has some hardware or software defect.Looking at getting it replaced, Netgear does offer RMA over the phone - however their ""tech support"" is only 90 days from purchasing the device - otherwise they expect you to buy a support contract with them - which is completely insane for a $200+ device. I will not be recommending Netgear products any longer. And I will have to try and sell this as-is to recoup the losses. I won't ever get my lost time back, though.Update: I contacted their support to get this device RMA’d and the rep was polite but basically said since my device turns on, it’s not a hardware issue- and that since I’ve owned it longer than 90 days I’d have to buy a support contract through them to troubleshoot. Yeah— no. I cannot recommend NETGEAR to anyone as a brand anymore.",Started misbehaving after almost a year.. tech support being 90 days is silly,Style: 2000Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

The Netgear CM1200, so far, has not dropped the connection since I got it, and is reporting significantly fewer errors than the Arris SB8200 did on the same connection.My home is far from the cable company head-end, and their system commands our modem to transmit with high upstream power so that our signal will reach them. The SB8200 reboots when it is commanded to about 40 dBmv per upstream channel, dropping the connection. This is noted in the log as ""Dynamic Range Window Violation"". The Netgear CM1200 is capable of a higher transmitter power, and happily exceeds the 40 dBmv that was the show-stopper for the Arris. Both modems had ""extended upstream power"" enabled. The CM1200 is running 35 dBmv on 4 upstream channels and 39.3 on the fifth, and I've seen it commanded to 41.5 dBmv so far without a need to reboot. Both modems are probably using the Broadcom BCM3390 chipset, the log entries of both modems look similar so the firmware is probably related.Also, the Netgear CM1200 has an error log, which persists across a power-clear, while the Arris SB8200 _used_ to have an error log, and no longer does. It got removed with a firmware update pushed by Comcast Business during the past year. Was it removed because more memory was needed for another purpose, or because that log is just too incriminating about poor cable performance? Nobody's going to tell me.The Netgear CM1200 has four ethernet ports, all usable, while the Arris SB8200 had two ports, and the second was only usable with port-bonding turned on (which means both would be connected to the same device). The Netgear CM1200 can bond two ports while the other two remain gigabit ports, or all 4 can be used as gigabit ports.. Having 4 usable ports means I can take an ethernet switch out of my network setup, and have one less thing to fail.The modem contains Open Source software, and Netgear properly and prominently displays the GPL license. They don't however, have the source code on their Open Source site (use Google) at this writing. The source code for the next older modem is present, and is probably similar.",Worked better than Arris SB8200,Style: 2000Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I then upgraded my internet service with my ISP and basically maxed out the bandwidth based on what was available in my area (~220MB/s).For reference, my service is with Comcast Xfinity, and the physical change in the modem was very easy, as it was a straight drop-in replacement for me.  The only annoyance was having to actually talk to a Comcast representative on the phone to have them switch out the MAC address settings in their system for my connection, otherwise the service wasn't authorized. Both the website activation page (which was available after hookup) and the automated phone service menu didn't offer me a way to perform the switch-out automatically, so be ready to call them up and read over the MAC address to get things up and running.The resulting speed upgrades led to Netflix and Amazon Prime Video running better, with higher resolution, when having multiple sessions, and some services like PlayStation NOW (""streaming"" online games for older PS systems) going from totally unusable to working perfectly.

I used to have a Motorola Surfboard 6141 I believe (going off memory). That modem at times would randomly drop speeds down to 1mb/s maximum for no reason, then throttle back up. I tried to research this and found out it might have been related to the Time Warner Maxx internet package I have (I'm grandfathered into a package that currently doesn't exist). No idea how or why that would matter but it seems to be the reason why my old Surfboard was having problems.So a deal hit and I dropped cash for this modem in hopes I could solve this problem fairly cheaply and so far its working. I haven't noticed any lag, no strange behavior like dropping to 1mb/s speeds, its been consistent and constant fast speeds, even above the stated speeds I should receive. The unit is well ventilated so the concern of heating up is not an issue. It's barely warm to the touch. I think as others have stated, if you put this in a confined space, for example an entertainment center with a glass door, then it'll heat up more than likely because there's no internal fan. But if you provide adequate air circulation then it'll function perfectly from my point of view.Also I wasn't able to successfully hook up the unit and remotely update to Time Warner that I am switching modems (Mac address) so I had to call them. The tech was able to get me going and took about 10 mins.All in all its so far a great intermediate modem.",Best mid-range value modem,Style: 300Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

I was using this modem with Spectrum's 400mbps tier service for the last 10 months, and previously on XFinity at 300mbps for the ~12 months prior to that. Within the last week (August 2020) it started freaking out and resetting every couple minutes. It would go offline indefinitely where it wouldn't even try to pull a downstream signal (unless I reset it). It was not a Spectrum issue, as my neighbor's internet remained online throughout the issues with zero interruption (also Spectrum).I tried everything: software reset through the web portal, hard reset from the unit, etc. Nothing fixed it. It continued to just be terrible and ""spazzing out"". It's frustrating to have something work and then become a brick. Replaced with an Arris SB6192 (dropped down to Docsis3.0) and am getting a perfect 460mpbs down on my 400mbps plan.Note: I also used this with an XR500 and XR700 router and the routers did NOT perform well. Regardless of DumaOS settings, I couldn't pull more than 50mbps down to any device (even with QOS off or QOS on and at 100 for a single device - would still cap it at 50). I switched to the Nighthawk MK62 and am pulling 300-460mpbs ON WIFI throughout the house now.",Broke within 2 years.

I chose the new Netgear CM1150V since it was on the Xfinity approved list, and was really the only option for a DOCSIS 3.1 modem w/voice.  As you can see from the images I installed the CM1150V in my Structured Media Center (SMC).  I removed the base with a Torx-8 screwdriver and attached the unit to mounting brackets with Velcro.Activation couldn't have been easier.  I connected my laptop directly to the modem, turned on the unit (it has a convenient On/Off switch), and within a short time a browser window popped up and I was connected to the Xfinity service.  I stepped through the quick account verification steps and literally in about 10 minutes everything, including phone, were active and running fine.As installed in my SMC this modem seems to runs pretty cool... I can barely feel any warmth at the top of the unit.  My main complaint is the very dim status lights, which can only been seen in the dark.  I guess if the modem was installed in a visible location very bright status lights would be annoying, but I still think they could be more prominent.Download/upload speeds are good, but not nearly close to my advertised gig speed.  I'm consistently getting about 300 Mbps down and 40 Mbps up.  The cable infrastructure in our circa 1984 neighborhood probably needs an upgrade.Overall I'm very satisfied as this DOCSIS 3.1 unit should be ""future proof"" for quite some time and the moderate size allowed me to install it directly in my SMC in place of the old, obsolete Arris.",CM1150V Super Easy Installation,Style: 2000Mbps Max Download w/VoiceVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

My test wasn’t super scientific but directionally there was big jump in overall bandwidth and I credit this to the new hardware and the 32x8 stream support. It’s not very noticeable since most devices don’t use that much bandwidth for browsing and basic streaming... but I’m confident in the additional bandwidth and once everyone is connected and we have 4 people streaming the occasional slowness and re-buffering will improve.

I decided to buy it because I don't like the preset configuration of the Spectrum cable modem that comes with the Spectrum subscription.  I prefer one that is not pre-configured and I'm glad I bought my own cable modem now that I have it.I went to the Spectrum website to find pre-approved modem models that are compatible with Spectrum equipment (you can do this with any cable company).  I found that there are a lot of modems that are compatible, and I selected one based on the speed of my account and the price.  I run about 300 MB/s speed, so I selected the Netgear Cable Modem model CM700 because it's rated for at least 400 MB/s and the price was very reasonable when compared to the competition.I was pleased with the CM700 right out of the box.  It's much smaller than most other cable modems, and like most, it's mindlessly easy to hook up.  It has a power plug that goes to a 110 volt AC outlet, a cable plug that goes to the cable outlet on the wall, and an ethernet plug that can plug into a PC, or a router/wireless router, or even into a network switch (gigabit switch).Once I took the CM700 out of the box, I looked at the quick-start guide, and I had the CM700 set up and running in less than a minute.  I tested it, and it gives great speed too.  The CM700 plugs into my wireless router (the uplink plug). It feeds the wireless router and a PC that is wired directly to one of the wireless router ethernet output plugs.  The wireless speed I get from this set up is excellent, and the direct-connect speeds I get exceed my expectations.  Look at the pictures, and you'll see from the quick-start guide how easy the CM700 sets up.The only criticism I have of the CM700 is that it seems to run warm, but then again, it has no malfunctions whatsoever.  Also, I'm guessing that it has a great internal heat-sink, and I see that it has lots of holes for air ventilation, so that keeps it within the operating temperature range.Overall, I rate the CM700 a 5 star unit, based on both performance and price.",This Cable Modem is a Winner,Style: 500Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,

Spent an hour on phone with back office - Although this modem was brand new their database rejected the serial number (said it had been ""deleted"" and could never be used again.)  Xfinity tech left shaking his head in disbelief.So although modem seems perfectly fine, I had to return it to get an exact duplicate with another serial number.  Hopefully new one will not have same issues.Lesson:  Do not follow the printed install and do things online.  Instead, call Xfinity, wend your way through their maddening telephone tree, get to a living person, and register device *BEFORE* doing anything.Fortunately the old Arris unit was still around and could be put back into service.Plan on a couple of hours, or in my case days, of ""fun"".Lesson: Begin on a Monday morning in order to give lots of time for possible visit from Xfinity tech.Note to Netgear: Please print *BOTH* MAC addresses on the shipping box rather than only on the bottom of the unit itself.

Works great with higher speed internet services. Gig speeds are a go with this guy. Also, uses Broadcom chipset, much better than intel puma’s that are in a lot of other products. This device does not have WiFi nor would I have bought it if it had. Not a big fan of the combos modems.  For WiFi, you will need a dedicated wireless router for that part of the service. I’d recommend orbi and most nighthawks depending on your needs, size and budget. I am a seasoned cable repair/ install tech and I ve seen some reviews that say this is a bad product. I’d highly recommend if you have issues to get a technician from your internet service provider to trouble shoot your home cable system and network set up. Potentially minor cable issues here and there can add up, so it’s worth a call even if it’s a charge for them to repair any issues they may detect. Lastly my only regret was buying this in Dec 2018. I had been waiting patiently for a docsis 3.1 internet and telephone service capable modem but decided not to past up on a holiday sale. Current set up I have is my own modem for internet and a leased modem for telephone service only. So, a month or so later (2019) that’s exactly what netgear released but I was unable to return my modem to buy one of those because the return policy expired after 30 days. Guess I’ll have to wait a while for this one to pay its self off before I get that other model I believe is the docsis 3.1/telephone 1200 model number.

Instillation is not smooth as you need to call Xfinity to register the device to your account.  The documentation makes you think this is automatic, but not even close.  By far the worst part of the product is it contains a HUGE AC/DC converter at the plug which makes it impossible to plug into any normal UPS system.  The huge plug also is directed sideways vs up/down, so it ends up blocking other outlets on your UPS.  A CyberPower 1500 definitely is not setup for this modem's plug as you'll lose 2 other battery backup plugs (out of 6) if you plug this in, so it effectively takes up 3 of the 6 battery backed plugs!  The previous Arris modem I had used a normal plug and had no issues (took only 1 battery backed up plug).  I'm now looking at having to purchase a UPS simply to keep the modem up and running.  The Arris also had a built-in battery backup for the phone, but this one needs a UPS to support battery backup of the phone feature.","Great modem, terrible power connector",Style: 2000Mbps Max Download w/VoiceVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

So, the core question is - does the CM1150V successfully replace my voice-enabled Comcast/Xfinity Cable modem?  The answer to that is an emphatic YES.  Next, does the CM1150V improve upon the Comcast/Xfinity Cable modem for download speeds if I have Gigabit-level Xfinity service?  The answer to that is also an emphatic YES - for me, moving from a max speed with the Xfinity modem of roughly 670 Mbps to 888.5 Mpbs with the CM1150V - which is a massive improvement!  The last question - is this Netgear modem easy to install?  The answer to that, for me, was NO - but it was still worth it.  The suggested technique of simply connecting to the ""activate"" link via an ethernet connection to my computer did not work.  I had to call XFinity.  I called late at night (big mistake, as their activation team only works during the day).  As a result, the activation did not work, after a lengthy attempt.  But, by morning, after their activation team kicked in, the Netgear modem was almost successfully provisioned.  I *still* had to perform the ""activate"" feature, but this time the activate page actually loaded.  Once done, it was off to the speed races!

The modem does say 500mbps max download for wired via ethernet; I have my desktop wired and it claims the speed is 1.0gbps (which is 1000mpbs) not sure why it is doubled but I'm not complaining! The only thing is this modem does not have a port for the telephone line; though this does not impact me because I do not have a landline.

So I put the newer router back on and tried an old backup modem, suddenly the connection issues were fixed.Having determined that the modem was the problem and that there were still two weeks left on the one year warranty, I tried filing a claim to get the modem replaced on Netgear's site. No one touched the claim for over a week, so I emailed them asking for a status update, whereupon I was informed that I needed to call their tech support number. The tech support person I connected with then explained to me that he was only allowed to help me during the first 90 days, and if I wanted him to diagnose my problem I needed to buy an extended warranty that cost more than the modem had. I asked what the point of the modem having a one year warranty was, if they were unable/unwilling to do anything to fix the situation  and just got more spiel about how buying the extended warranty would also cover any other networking equipment I owned. After being frustrated for 20 minutes I hung up.So buyer beware, while Netgear advertises a one year warranty, it's simply not true. You get 90 days and after that you're either on your own or you buy one of their expensive extended warrantys.

After this I kept my eye on the clock and almost every 13 minutes it would drop the signal and 2 minutes later it would come back. It did this about ten times in a row. Luckily after this I decided to ignore the drops and hope that it was just temporary, after that it dropped signal after 30 ish minutes and later would stay online for another hour and a half. I haven’t noticed any more drops since that night.Moral of this story is; it’s a good modem but do keep in mind the one and two star reviews as they probably are a possible outcome you could get after buying this modem.

Xfinity had no idea why with all the lights on the device green it wasn't connecting so I suggested to unplug it once all lights were on and everything was ok to go once all lights were back on.The process of getting it replaced was a hassle as well. I contacted Amazon for replacement and because Amazon had no idea how the product worked they asked ""well did you contact manufacturer?"". I told them no however I went through all trouble shoot processes and the reset button doesn't reset the device and that I'm still within replacement period with Amazon. They said ""contact manufacturer, if it doesn't work still they will replace it"". Netgears customer service was great with helping and in my color code statement was what they said to me. That if the power light is blinking and non responsive, that the device needs to be replaced. They offered a replacement, but said if you're within the return time with Amazon go through them to get it replaced. I then contacted Amazon once again to explain the situation. That I was told to contact back if the manufacturer wasn't able to get it up and running. Then they asked me specifically ""what steps did the manufacturer tell you to do in order to troubleshoot the device"" I then explained everything that I did and everything I did with netgear. They had to check to see if I was within the return time and Amazon said they will send a replacement.The product has 30 days from purchase from Amazon to replace it, however if you're still within 90 days of purchase netgear will replace it. Amazon has sent me a replacement and I will update my rating once I've used this just as long as the previous one within issues. Hopefully I just had a faulty device and won't have an issue with this one.",Broke in less than a month: Take your own risk,Style: 1000Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I pay for high speed internet, but I rarely got it with the rented modem. I had to reset the modem all the time, sometimes 5 times a day because we'd lose connectivity. I live in a rural area, so I was never sure what was going wrong- whether it was Medicom or our equipment. Mediacom would come out to my house and each time it's like they replaced the rented modem with an even older version. I'm pretty sure the last one was from 1995. That's what it looked like. So finally, I did the research and figured out which modem is compatible with Mediacom and purchased this one. You do have to buy a separate router- the modem gathers the internet from the Mediacom cable and then the router broadcasts it as wifi. I had to figure that out as well. So you need both this modem and a router unless you just want to use an ethernet cable from the modem to your computer without using wifi. Long story longer, this modem with the router I purchased (NETGEAR R6700 Nighthawk AC1750 Dual Band Smart WiFi Router, Gigabit Ethernet (R6700) ) fixed our internet problems.

I'll be as brief as possible.I switched to Xfinity so purchased this modem on a Wednesday, arrived on Friday. Invested the next 5 hours from 1pm to 6pm attempting to set this modem up. Tried for the first 45 minutes to set it up on my own, but couldn't get it (I'm a millennial, meaning, I'm not completely technologically inept and can generally figure tech stuff out on my own). So, I called Xfinity, spent an hour, nothing, told me to call Netgear. Called Netgear, spent an hour, nothing, told me to call Xfinity. Called Xfinity (second time), spent an hour, nothing, told me to call Netgear. Called Netgear (second time), spent an hour, nothing, so I gave them my phone number and they said a ""Senior Technician"" would call me that night. It should be no surprise that I never received a call from said ""Senior Technician"". I returned that modem to Amazon the next day and purchased the Motorola MG7540 instead, which was delivered LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER (yea, it's twice the cost, but I also don't have to bother with a separate router and more cords, so, meh). Took a quick 7 minute phone call with Xfinity to set up my Motorola MG7540.The issue with the Netgear modem was that I actually DID get internet by hardwiring into it on my computer, but ONLY on my computer (wouldn't work hardwiring into my Apple TV, Apple Airport Express, or Xbox One). Neither Xfinity nor Netgear could figure out why. Dr. Google didn't know either despite scouring numerous forums attempting to find someone with my similar issue.Buyer, beware, and heed the 1-star reviews.EDIT:To Netgear’s credit, I may have gotten a lemon modem, which I understand happens.

Nevertheless, I am giving the Netgear CM1150V a 3 because it required several hours of troubleshooting and a Support call in order to get the modem up and running (-1), and because the Ethernet ports are not available (-1).In hopes that someone from Netgear will read this post, and to certainly save you hour(s) of troubleshooting headache, I’ll go into detail on my issue.  Because if you move past the setup, this is a great modem.The resolution to my problem was to have the router(s) spoof their MAC address.tldr;About me:  Professionally, I was a network administrator, so I’m familiar with routers and their concepts.  This was not a plug-and-play installation, and thus the reason I’m rating the CM1150V so harshly.  That said, the Xfinity rep said that the CM1150V is a fantastic modem, and that Comcast partnered with Netgear to build this modem.  My initial testing is that it is lightning fast, and I thus far have no regrets with my purchase.About my network:  I had an Arris modem (rental from Xfinity).  I read about DOCSIS 3.1 and wanted to upgrade the modem because our family usage of the Internet (with three teenagers) has shot up dramatically with Covid-19.  After some analysis, I knew that we were experiencing network contention, and I needed to upgrade my modem and router.Old NetworkArris modem -> Netgear R6300v2New NetworkCM1150V -> Netgear AX8 -> Netgear R6300v2In my new design the AX8 is the primary router, and I ran ethernet and plugged the R6300v2 into an area near the bedrooms.  So it is operating as a satellite hub.I chose to purchase Netgear products exclusively because I’ve been pleased with the R6300v2 and thought that it would be an easier setup/installation.After installing and getting the CM1150V set up, I plugged a PC into the ethernet port, and was able to load several websites, so I knew the CM1150V was functional.  However, both routers had issues connecting to the Internet.  I tried several things, including a factory reset to no avail, so I reached out to Netgear Support.It turned out that both the AX8 and the R6300v2 required enabling MAC spoofing (use the MAC address of the router) in order communicate with the Modem.  Since my R6300v2 didn’t require that with the Arris, I really think they should fix this, or make it more straightforward during the setup.If you follow these steps, you can enable the MAC spoofing and be all set:1. On the AX8, click on the “Advanced” tab2. Click on “Setup” in the Left Hand Nav3. Click on “Internet Setup”4. Scroll to the bottom of Internet Setup and look for “Router MAC Address”5. Change setting to “Use this MAC Address” (after clicking the Router MAC Address will automatically populate).6. Click Apply7. Reboot the modem (wait until modem has completely booted up) and then reboot the router.I had to take these steps for both the R6300v2 and the AX8.  In both cases after I specified the router MAC address I was able to connect to the modem.Since neither of the routers had an issue with my previous modem, I consider this an issue with the CM1150V and not the router.I haven’t had the CM1150v long enough to encounter any other issues.  And as I stated earlier in this post, I have no regrets in making this purchase.",Great modem; challenges installing with AX8 and R6300v2,Style: 2000Mbps Max Download w/VoiceVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Looking at the signal strength readings, they seemed to be good enough for the faster Nighthawk model.One thing to consider: our house had been pre-wired with a fancy junction box containing a multi-port splitter (1 in, 8 out). During our original setup and connection, the Xfinity tech checked the output signals and said they were too weak for dependable performance with TV or Internet. Because we run just two TVs and the modem, he reconnected everything using a one-in/three-out splitter. All has been well, and we're hoping this remains true with the gigabit Nighthawk. If that changes, I'll post an update.One more note: Netgear included a good set of start-up instructions in the box. Unfortunately, using the xfinity.com/activate website is a no-go on the system in our area. Instead, your options are either installing the Xfinity app on your smartphone or calling the toll-free number.

Keep in mind that this is a DOCSIS 3.1 modem whereas many others out there are only DOCSIS 3.0.  Buying into the higher standard now will push off obsolescence.I purchased the modem for use with Xfinity's internet service and my download speeds went from 150MBps, limited by my old modem, to 290MBps.  Thanks to other reviews, I called Comcast with the device serial number and MAC address before hooking it up.  They then stepped me through the startup process.  It took about 15-20 minutes.  My Netgear Nighthawk router required me to log into it once the new modem was on-line so you should have that username and password handy.The faster speed was immediately confirmed using Comcast's Speedtest website and accessing it with a laptop plugged into the back of the router.  I did find that the faster speed only showed up on wireless devices that could access the 5G band of the router.  Not all our devices, like older Roku boxes, have 5G capability and didn't benefit in a big way from the speed boost.  Newer iPads do pretty well as long as they are connected to the 5G band.I also noticed that I had to buy a new WIFI receiver for my desktop computer as the old one, although rated at 300MBps, didn't really get that speed and topped out around 180MBps.  I replaced it with a Netgear AC1900 receiver, which is also expensive but gave me 100% of the max speed being sent by the modem and router.  Altogether, it cost about $240 to get the new speed bump from Comcast.  Of course, you can opt to lease a new modem from Comcast instead of buying it.  In my case, the new modem pays for iteself after about two years.I do owe Comcast a note of thanks for sending an email that my old modem would not give me the higher speeds and when I called their customer service to confirm, I actually talked to someone who knew what they were doing and talked me through using 5G, checking older devices and making sure that routers and receivers were all gigbit rated.",Does bring faster speeds but make sure your router supports 5G!,Style: 1000Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,10 people found this helpful

Right? It seemed that way. This modem was simple to install, easy to use, and reasonably fast. The math made sense until the modem straight up stopped working 8 months later. The 'internet' light started blinking on and off, and no amount of power cycling or setting resetting would change that. After several conversations with my ISP, they were able to confirm that the modem itself was the issue, not the internet connection, and that since the modem wasn't one of theirs, I would have to go through Netgear for support.Netgear support is hard to reach, slow to pick up the phone, and they refused to troubleshoot the settings on the unit because it was out of the 90 day support window. The tech was ready to hang up until I mentioned that if he couldn't troubleshoot it, I wanted to replace the unit under the one year warranty. I think they're banking on customers not being aware of that warranty, because he certainly didn't mention it. Only after I mentioned replacing the unit under warranty did he actually try to see if something was wrong with the unit, and after a few minutes of guiding me through basic troubleshooting I had already done, he told me I could send it in because it might be defective.I had to pay $16 shipping on the unit to get the replacement expedited - they do have a ""free"" shipping option but that takes two weeks because it requires you to ship the defective unit in before they sent the replacement. But who, in 2019, would be okay with another two weeks without internet? For $16, they actually ship a new modem out to you first, and then you can send the defective unit back in the box they sent with their own shipping label.Now, in addition to being without internet for over a week, I have spent a total of $185 on this modem. Redo the math: the cable provider charges $11/month for their own rental, so I would have only saved money with this modem at 17 months. But anecdotally, the actual life span of the unit is 8 months, so hitting 17 months isn't a sure thing. You could get really unlucky and have the unit fail *after* your one year warranty is up. In 8 more months when my replacement unit once again inexplicably stops working for no good reason, I can tell you my next modem won't be purchased from Netgear. After this experience, I might just bite the bullet and rent my next modem from the ISP. At least at the ISP's stores, the $11/month rented modem can be traded in for free and on the same day.",Comes with a one year warranty.

This modem is expensive for a non-functional piece of crap -  at the time I bought it $240..... What a Joke!!!6.

This product will make you unhealthily angry.7. This modem will make you lose money -  The HORRIBLE experience we had with this modem made my GF say that she doesn't want any Netgear product in our house.

I received a marketing outreach from Netgear talking about their line of cable modems and purchasing versus renting. I went out to the Comcast web site to see if the Netgear modem was supported with my service (1Gig internet, 1 voice line). Comcast showed that the Netgear CM1150V was certified for use with my service. I read a number of reviews to see if provisioning the modem would be easy or a pain. Most reviewers on Amazon had positive experiences with provisioning the modem on Comcast's network.For those who use the WiFi on the Xfinity cable modem/router (they call it a gateway), the Netgear CM1150V might not be exactly what you are looking for. I was not using the WiFi on the Comcast gateway (I had the gateway in bridge mode). I have a tricky space to get strong WiFi coverage, and have been relying on Netgear's Orbi to get good WiFi around our house.To provision the Netgear cable modem, you will need a computer that has an ethernet port. Many newer ultrabooks do not have one built in, so you might need to get an external dongle style adapter. To provision the modem, it was very simple. I disconnected the existing Comcast gateway, hooked the cable the modem, and connected ethernet cable from port 1 on the modem to my Macbook. Plugged in the new cable modem, and waited probably 10 minutes for all of the lights to come on. Once the lights were settled, opened a browser on the Macbook, and went to the Xfinity page. All I needed was my Comcast user and password. The modem was then provisioned by Comcast, and it rebooted. I connected the ethernet 1 port on the cable modem to my Orbi router's internet port, and connected my phone line to the phone port. Phone service was up and running, and the internet was humming along (Speedtest showed a little over 900 Mb/second download and 40 Mb/second upload).

The thing to understand however is that the link aggregation is a little bit tricky to get configured for those of us who use network security appliances like we do in the office. So be prepared to know how to setup 2 WAN connections to do this. If you have a directly compatible Netgear router or switch, apparently its just plug and play? We don't use Netgear switching or wireless access points so we cannot verify this other than what the disclaimers  and product reviewers say. However It has been pretty stable for the couple days we've had it in service. It is gigabit ready. It also is able to accommodate another local IP provided your ISP offers that service.  We have two so this is great to create consolidated networks for guest and mission critical applications.  It runs a little warm. This is to be expected because it has a really chunky Broadcom processor in there. My only real gripe is that for a 220 dollar modem they couldn't be bothered to make wall mounting an option? Really?  I suppose we'll have to make a stand for it or something... Other than that it's pretty nice.

I was able to work with Comcast to get this provisioned and setup properly after a few calls.  Unfortunately, there was a problem with the upstream data reliability of this cable modem.  The modem shows completely healthy but drops a lot of packets making the network connection very unreliable.I had Comcast out to investigate on several occasions and they tested my line and reported everything as clean.  The Comcast line test modem worked perfectly, and a new Xfinity XB7 off the truck worked perfectly, no lost packets.  So we established that the NETGEAR modem was defective by confirming two other devices are working great on the line.I opted to keep the XB7 and pay Comcast the $14/mo fee and my plan was to ask NETGEAR to replace the modem under warranty.  This is when is discovered what kind of company I was dealing with..I called NETGEAR and asked them to replace the modem and honor their 1 year warranty.  This is when the technician kindly explained to me that because 90 days had passed, they would need to charge me an additional $229 for a service support contract in order to process my warranty claim.  So NETGEAR will not honor their 1 year warranty without me paying more than the modem originally cost in order to process a warranty claim.I'm pretty sure this must be illegal under some state laws, but I am not going to give NETGEAR even more money to get warranty support.  So buyer beware, NETGEAR will not honor their warranty.  You will be stuck with a brick and have no way to return the product.I do give Amazon credit, they listened into my phone conversation with NETGEAR and recorded NETGEAR's refusal to honor their warranty and offered me a refund.

In order to take advantage of the internet speed I'm paying for, decided to upgrade my modem. Since the router gave excellent service, decided to go with Netgear for the modem. And, Comcast stated this one was supported, so I ordered it. I disconnected the router and wired the new modem directly to my desktop. It literally installed itself when Comcast detected I was installing a new device. With my older modem, it required a phone call and you had to supply the modem's SN and MAC address so they could configure things on their end. OK, now the fun part. You'd think the next step would simply plug in the router the same way as the old one and it would work, right? No such luck. I followed Netgear's instructions to the letter and it still wouldn't connect to the net. I called Comcast for a bit of technical help. They said all was well on their end but it may be a communication problem between the modem/router connection. Here's where it gets interesting.... I go to Netgear's web page and register the modem. Then, I called their toll free technical support number. I was connected to a call center in India. I could barely understand the person to whom I was talking and realized I was in for an ordeal. As so many others have said, their tech help/support is a total scam. Even though you have a brand new product, they refuse to do a blessed thing for you unless you pay a certain fee. In my case, they wanted $139!! Let's do the math.. the modem was $79.99 and they wanted almost twice as much to give me a bit of support?? I laughed until I cried before hanging up on them. If this is how Netgear operates, I hope they go out of business and never heard from again. Their whole business model is a scam, a fraud, and probably illegal.

After a power cycle, the internet would work for a period of time, but I started experiencing micro-disconnects (best description I have). Where my connection would stutter and interrupt streaming, but not disconnect me from the streaming service. It would start to happen frequently (every 15 minutes or so) until a power cycle. This would generally resolve the issue for the day, but it would continue the next day. I worked through my ISP and determined that the issue lied in my equipment. I reached out to Netgear after reading that these models are made with faulty chip sets. They were beyond useless, and borderline rude about my call. The rep ran a diagnostic check, and because it came back “OK” there was nothing they were willing to do for me. They did offer a subscription to their Gear Heads program to SEE if there was anything else they could do. Offering a good will replacement or repair would have gone a long way.

I just moved on to another company and got rid of the Comcast Business service and went with their GB offering.  I was using an Arris Docsis 3.0 cable modem into an Orbi network with 6 nodes covering ~6000 square feet.  I have over 30 devices connected to the network and do everything from video conferencing, Roku, AppleTV, Ring, Nest, PS4 and VoIP just to name some of the services I run.  I also live in a canyon and I don’t have mobile phone service, so my mobile runs over my network, I’m definitely not suffering from the cobbler children scenario and I’m very picky when it comes to my network.When I got Comcast GB, I was between their business service and the new service so I used their Comcasts cable modem for a week, made by Netgear.  It ran hot, provide slow service (using Speedtest and doing my own TraceRTs) and I turned their wireless service off to help stabilize the box, however, the box rebooted constantly.  To replace it I originally went with the Arris 8200.  Over the course of two months the network would go down randomly multiple times a week and usually with my son yelling “the network is down again” during Fortnite.  I looked at the logs, nothing. Turned features on the Orbi off after reading their forums, didn’t work (not to blame but poor advice).  Hard wired Roku, AppleTV, again reading forums, didn’t work.  I had Comcast specialists come out check the wiring, look at the logs on their end, nothing.  I finally concluded mostly because there was nothing else to try that it was the cable modem so I purchased the Netgear CM1000.Installation:  I followed the poor instructions included with the modem and nothing, it showed connected but hardwired I wasn’t able to get anywhere.  On my third try I decided to call Comcast support and have them install it.  Gave them the mac address and my network dropped (I knew this would happen since again my network is my only source to the outside communications world).  I noticed this time that the lighting sequence was different so I gave it some time, hardwired into the modem and all was well.  I connected and booted the Orbi and the network has been up and stable since then, no random reboots.  I run daily Speedtests and have noticed ~10% in overall performance from both wired and wireless devices over the Arris, however YMMV.Pros:- Works and I haven’t had the random reboots- By my measurements ~10% faster- Like the black over the Arris 8200 whiteCons:- It does run a bit hot but nothing I’m worried about- Didn’t set up out of the box with Netgear saying in their documentation that if you have problems call the cable provider, poor customer service.

Picture quality on the TVs in the house, even the ones which had only a coax connection and were not connected to the modem, dropped significantly.  Apparently this is due to the Xfinity modem using MoCA which is a way of layering a data network over the coax wiring in the house.

I used Google web search with the phrase ""internet speed test"" to find several different speed test web pages.  The top result was Google's own widget (using ""M-Lab"").  I also tried ""speedtest.com"" and the speed test page offered by Cox Communications.  I used those three speed test sites, and many others.  I tested in two different VirtualBox virtual machines: Windows XP SP3 and Ubuntu 17.10.1 (Linux).  (I avoid web browsing directly in my host OS for most sites.) Because I did the tests in VMs, the speeds might be somewhat lower than if the tests were conducted in the host OS.  The peak download speed I observed was 348 Mbps (~5:30 A.M. PDT, 40 miles to server), and the peak upload speed I observed was 35 Mbps (for many cities, up to 2,800 miles), with latency of 9-12 ms for servers within 40 miles.  However, in late evening, download speeds within 40 miles were generally in the 160 to 200 Mbps range.I think it is crucial to recognize the dramatic effect of time of day and the day of the week, and also the distance to the server which is being used for the internet speed test.  Some speed test sites enable the user to select servers in different cities, and I think it is important to repeat tests with different cities to see just how important distance (and, implicitly, network hops) is for download speed, upload speed, latency, and jitter.This modem enabled me to achieve download and upload speeds notably higher than the maximum speeds promised by Cox for my service tier (300 Mbps download, 30 Mbps upload).  So, my ISP service tier is the limiting factor.I feel compelled to mention that a few isolated internet speed test runs performed relatively poorly -- like a single instance of a download speed of 60 Mbps (slow!), ten seconds after a result of 160 Mbps, and twenty seconds before a result of 194 Mbps.  These isolated slow test runs are uncommon and random; and, so, it is important to repeat tests several times to make sure that incidental connection issues, which have nothing to do with the cable modem or ""last-mile"" ISP link, are recognized.I did many test runs from a Linux VM to a server within 40 miles, and all download speeds exceeded 319 Mbps, and routinely hit 346+ Mbps, around 5:30 A.M. local time, notably faster than the 300 Mbps promised by my ISP service tier.One final note: Although disconnecting my previous cable modem, and connecting the NETGEAR CM1000, was sufficient to access the Cox ""cable modem activation"" web page, their web page encountered an error, and I was forced to call Cox on the phone to complete activation (with modem serial number and MAC address).  It took several ""reset"" commands from Cox before they detected the modem, and a couple of power cycles, all during the phone call, before it worked.  Now, I am very pleased with the speed, and it is tempting to upgrade to Cox's Gigablast tier.","Exceeds Cox ""Ultimate"" (300Mbps down, 30Mbps up) speeds",Style: 1000Mbps Max DownloadVerified Purchase,9 people found this helpful

It worked fine at first, but over a couple months  we started noticing Netflix and Prime Video would stop.  Problems got more frequent  until I called Netgear support in May, shortly before the warranty expired. The problem didn’t get resolved, and I naïvely bought their Pro Support plan so that I could try to recover my investment over the next month. Problems continued to become more frequent, and rebooting the modem would solve them. Now in July the high packet loss rate and occasional entire hang is not always being resolved by the reboot. I spent five hours (mostly on hold), and Netgear said Comcast had to make a change. I called Comcast and they said the setting needed to be changed inside the modem. So I called Netgear support again the next day and once they got my case number then while I was explaining the problem the line went dead but didn’t drop. I called back and the same thing happened again. I gave up, wondering whether it was a tactic to avoid replacing my modem.
