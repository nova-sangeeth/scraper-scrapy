I am mostly happy with the product I receive, which is what I expect to happen.  But when I have a problem, I report it.  This router failed to live up to it's promises.  After configured, which was easy, the router failed to maintain a consistent internet connection.  At first, I would get the promised 200+ mps from Spectrum in the 5G wireless connection but after a couple of hours the speed coming out of the router in both the wired and wireless connections would drop.  At first I would notice that I would get buffering in YouTube TV or Amazon prime and eventually I was forced to reboot to get any internet connection to work.  I tested this scenario many times.  Several times I swapped back in the old TP-Link router I had, to see if I had a router problem or a Spectrum problem and each time the old router was hooked up, I had no problem after two days of use.  Therefore, I conclude that the new router is defective and I am returning it.  I am replacing it with the NETGEAR R6700 Nighthawk AC1750 which admittedly costs a little more but hopefully will come 100% ready to work out-of-the-box.I would like to point out that I tried to apply the latest firmware to the new TP-Link router but I could not figure out how to apply a new version to this router.

We wanted to replace our good old  Netgear router which was limiting our internet to about ~50/13 Mbps. When we connected the Tp-Link router the speed was about ~2/0.5 Mbps. We reinstalled the old Netgear and went back to the higher speeds. We thought the new router was defective so Amazon replaced it very promptly.  Unfortunately the replacement performed exactly as the previous so we had to return it. Perhaps there was a comparability issue with the modem or other gear but we could not identify the problem even with the expert assistance of the T-Link hone techs.

After consulting some friends (and the internet) I discovered that my download speed on ethernet would gradually drop by more than 50% throughout the day. Rebooting the router would fix this issue temporarily and I would hit the same speeds I get from connecting directly to my modem, but within an hour it would be back down to around ~20mbps which makes doing anything productive on the internet basically excruciating.Apparently a TON of people have this exact same issue. I spent hours reading threads on various websites and have tried all of the troubleshooting tips I could understand. I also spent a few additional hours writing a huge email to TP-Link's tech support explaining all of my issues in detail, taking screenshots, doing speed tests, etc. etc... and then I realized that all this work and time I'm putting into troubleshooting this router is not worth it.

I've known that was a mistake but still figured if my old one kept chugging along, what ain't broke...After lots of intermittent drops and various internet weirdness I broke down and decided to get a new router. I studied the state of the WiFi internet router art for a few days, VERY thoroughly, and this model kept coming up in recommendations across the web. It's competitive price and free return guarantee made it relatively painless and when it arrived setting it up was the same.

I'm averaging over 200% (!) better speeds than I was with the old D-Link router. Because this routers dual bands are broadcast separately you pretty much have two networks, the 2.4 & 5Ghz. The 2.4Ghz has better range and the 5Ghz has greater speeds; having that option is great and it means more devices can use the separate networks, reducing congestion.This is a seriously stout router for the cost and I'm extremely pleased with it. The routers optional mobile app has a ton of features you can dig into if you want to get deep into all of the routers possibilities, and it's also about as plug and play as it gets.

It has many of the standard features like white and black listing, port forwarding, etc. However, for someone like myself that needs to make this router as secure as possible... its not very secure. WPS can NOT be disabled. I have no idea what TP-Link was thinking, WPS is a basic vulnerability in all routers that have it equipped. This is why you can disable it. To be clear, WPS sends out a ""PIN"" unencrypted for the device that wants to connect, if you snag that ""PIN"" you can then see all traffic to and from that pc. I realize that many people love WPS and aren't worried about that level of security, which is why I wanted to write this review. Finally, it is Alexa enabled. You can use it to allow someone to connect with the above WPS, reset the router, and the only feature I've used via Alexa is to turn off the lights on the front of the router.

The TP-Link fell off a lot between -77 to - 80 dBm while my ASUS hovered around -70 dBm.

I understand that TP-link is much cheaper than google or netgear, but you cannot advertise something that doesn't exist, if your router supports only 50mbps, just say it won't go above that and people will make a decision whether they want to pay $60 for 50mpbs, or pay $150 for a better brand and 1gpbs.Long story short, if you really need high speed, go with a different brand, TP-Link is not there yet, and their customer support will most likely won't help you either.Update: I see reasonable improvement when switching to 5G band, but some devices don't support that, so still not a good router.",Don't buy it,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",5 people found this helpful

Here is my experience with this router:Setup: Very easy. I think this is probably the best part about this router as setting it up was extremely easy. Plug in the internet cord, connect to the wifi, download the app, and from there manage the settings. The issue is that there isnt much to manage within the app. You aren't able to manage connected devices, hide/show your SSID, analyze wifi traffic, or change the password for the individual wifi bands (i.e. 2.4 & 5ghz)as they semi operate as one.Signal: Above average at best. This router was tested in an apartment no more than 900 sqft, and yes signal does reach across the entire apt, but appears to barely do so. The only time full bars were achieved was in direct vicinity of the router.Speed: Average at best. I dont recall a time I tried to stream content (E.g., YouTube, HBO, Prime Video, etc) and my signal did not have to buffer for a second or two; this became really annoying, really quickly. Additionally, if you plan on connecting anything over 3 devices at once, this is not the router for you, as I dont think it can handle more than that and your speed will plummet.Overall, I would only recommend this router if you are someone who will only have less than 3 devices connected and plan on sitting within sight of it.

This is a problem as I am not “MAC address clairvoyant”; I do not know the MAC addresses of the devices of all future visitors to my home.  So I wanted to try something else and I was impressed with the rating and low price of the TP-Link Archer A7.  [In the voice of the economics teacher in Ferris Bueller’s day off] ‘The setup of the TP-Link Archer A7 was easy and straightforward.  Unfortunately the free mobile app, “Tether” does not provide the user the advanced configuration options which their competition offers.  For example, Linksys’ mobile application for Android sucks too but still allows users to accomplish a great deal more versus Tether.’ Blah blah (all that is true) blah As a result, I switched to a web browser and logged in via the TP-Link Archer A7 AC1750 configuration page which is a bright and responsive interface.  I then enabled whitelist access control and began adding MAC addresses.  Then the TP-Link Archer A7 stopped me from adding more at 29 wireless MAC addresses with the error that only 32 are supported.  The issue with the Archer A7 I am reviewing is wired devices are automatically added to the MAC address whitelist once it is enabled.  It’s very much screwed up but I see some logic in it.  As if the Archer A7 is saying, “Hello wired connection!  We trust you because you are wired so you are in the whitelist automatically.”But wired connections should not be included with a wireless MAC filter.  They are completely separate and that’s very much the point.  Wired connections are protected with physical security like the deadbolt on your front door prevents unauthorized users from entering your home and connecting a laptop or camera to your router via Ethernet cable.  Also unlike other wireless security measures, Wi-Fi whitelisting (aka MAC filtering) does not use ciphers, keys, or certificates and therefore has been impervious to zero-day attacks.  When configured it prevents anyone within radio range from compromising the wireless security measures configured and gaining access to your network.  MAC filtering prevents the connection entirely so they don’t even reach the Wi-Fi password prompt.  Quite literally if your wireless device’s MAC address is not included the whitelist it is not allowed to connect.But who cares if wired and wireless MAC addresses are all lumped together?  Yeah good question!  When whitelist is enabled on the TP-Link Archer A7, any wired devices increment (increase/add to) the total number of devices in the whitelist.  This means you may reach the maximum of 32 devices without having anything close to 32 wireless devices connected – which was my experience.  Even if you delete wired devices from the whitelist they come right back into the whitelist.  There is nothing you can do about it.  TP-Link getting this corrected should be a big deal but it appears as if I’m the only one reporting on it.  But generally I believe they have it right other than this inadvertent and variable whitelist capacity issue caused by mixing wired and wireless.  Which degrades a good product to the point I cannot use it at all.  Also I should point out it’s an issue their competition does not have.Question: If you reach the maximum of 32 and then you connect a new wired device, what happens?  Does it kill one of the Wi-Fi devices from the whitelist in favor of the newly connected wired device??Answer: I don’t know and I don’t care because the shenanigans of this were enough to kill the Archer A7 for me.But just to verify I wasn’t overlooking a setting or fix for this (FYI yes I had the latest firmware) I jumped on chat with TP-Link support at ~10:30pm.  Which was a good experience.  After TP-Link support confirmed the maximum number in a whitelist is 32, I began breaking down the install, defaulting the TP-Link Archer A7 router to factory specs, and packing it up to return to Amazon.  Because A) my older/slower router does not have this issue, B) the maximum of 32 MAC addresses is not documented in the spec sheet or appropriate section of the user manual (whitelisting by MAC section 10.2.) which I actually read before buying this router, and C) regardless of the wired connections incrementing the total number of whitelist MAC addresses I will soon have more than 32 wireless devices which need to be on the whitelist.  No, I don't own 32 wireless devices, but I need to have more than 32 on the whitelist.  32 is an insanely low number for a brand new/modern router.  Something like 144 or 255 would make sense.  But 32?!  Printing my return label now.  -BroSun",If You Use MAC Filtering READ THIS!,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",6 people found this helpful

I tried plugging it directly into the cable modem and setting it to DHCP. I could ping internet hosts from the diagnostic UI, but connected devices couldn’t ping or get traceroute past the router. I tried a static IP configuration and got the same result. Unplugging and powering off the devices didn’t help, and neither did switching between DHCP and static IPs on the LAN side.

It's compact, the interface is clean, and it's inexpensive compared to other brands. But it doesn't work. Literally. At random times, the WAN interface just disappears, leaving you with no Internet (other devices connected to the cable modem work fine, so it's not an upstream problem). Also randomly, the WiFi signal from either the 2.4 or 5ghz bands will just disappear for 15 seconds. And performance is lower than expected (compared to other similar routers), but still good for the price point.  And some items I have in my home simply don't connect to this router at all. I still can't explain it. They connect to the old router fine, but fail on this new TP-Link.Even past the hardware issues, the software is a mixed bag as well. The user interface is clean and tidy--kudos to TP-Link for that, but the administrator password is inexplicably restricted to 12 characters max, meaning I could not use my normal long mnemonic-style password, and instead had to come up with some short mishmash of characters that now is very ""securely"" recorded on a post-it note instead of in memory. Good job TP-Link. Of course, the actual Wi-Fi passwords can be as long and complex as you'd normally like, just not the most important ADMINISTRATIVE INTERFACE password. Also I had some issues with settings not being saved after having been changed. So go figure. Maybe I got a lemon, maybe they wrecked something when shoehorning Alexa support in.

So the A7 would work fine as a small home/apt router. I got it since the hardware and firmware are more current than the C9 to handle all the traffic. I think when I replace the C9 it will be with a tri-band router.Overall, it works.

I bought this as a backup to an older, failing router I had and the old one finally bit the dust today so I broke this one out and had it configured in about 10 minutes.In today's world (perhaps tomorrow's world), the demand for wireless speed and reliability is going to increase substantially.  If you think about it, almost every home in America has some sort of wireless device or connection.  With the advent of popular streaming devices and services, as well as ""smart"" devices, this is going to continue to increase.  Prior to last month, my internet service was 50Mbps/10Mbps down/up respectively.  For the sake of time, let's say that 10Mbps is equivalent to 1MB/s, where this is your actual download speed.  My ISP has gifted me with speeds of 300Mbps/20Mbps and the flaws of this router uncovered quickly with this speed.First of all, this is a single core processor router.  Folks, this single core performance is similar to the very old blue/black routers we all once had that transmitted on the 802.11G frequency in 2005.Long story short, wireless performance is about 30% of my speed.  This router cannot handle it.  If you have 100Mbps internet service, you are fine.  Anything greater than that, you are losing A LOT of wireless speed by selecting this router.  You won't really notice this until you start streaming 4K movies through popular subscription services, or trying to utilize your speed to download/upload large files.Now, research indicates that the 802.11ac transmission protocol should be able to push out around 1300Mbps under ideal conditions.  The link speed is only 800 Mbps MAX with this router, 5 feet away.  I am nowhere near maxing out 1300Mbps over this router which COULD theoretically happen if and only if local file transfers were going on and etc. but they are not.I've contacted customer service and they suggested changing various settings on the router.  I've done it.  I upgraded firmware and changed the channel width which is the recommended practice.  Yet, still having the same issues.  When the channel width increases to 80Mhz, what happens is the range goes down substantially.So at this point, I'm at a loss.  I either lose out on range OR lose out on speed.  For this reason I am going with a different brand of router so I can get the Internet speed for which I am paying.",Questionable performance,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",3 people found this helpful

Overall, as the headline says, this is a decent to good router, but from my point of view it has at least one design flaw.Every other router I've setup for myself and friends over the last 15 years or so have treated (as much as possible) the guest wireless network as totally separate from the main wireless network.  Basically this meant you could set up very stringent security settings on your main wireless network while leaving the guest network less stringent so that it's still easy to use by visitors.  For the most part this router offers the same number of options to make the main network more secure while leaving the guest network unaffected, but there is one significant option where they don't.TP-Link offers what they call ""Access Control"" where you can white list and black list devices by their MAC addresses.  Basically they're doing MAC address filtering, but unlike the other security options, this one applies to both the main and the guest network.  Every other router I've setup offers MAC address filtering, but the filter used for the main network did not affect the guest network.  Most routers I've setup also offered a separate MAC address filter for the guest network, but I've never seen a reason to use a filter on a guest network since it seems to go against the main reason for having a guest network.So when I turned on ""Access Control"" for the main network to ensure only expected devices could get on that network I was surprised to find visitors could no longer log into the guest wireless network.  I probably wouldn't have purchased this router if I'd known about this behavior before hand.  So in the future I'll need to keep this in mind before purchasing another TP-Link router.","A Decent to Good Router, But the Main and Guest Wireless Networks Are Not Completely Separated","Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",4 people found this helpful

Sadly this had tons of issues right away. The moment I tried to connect more than 1 wired device it began dropping internet every few hours and say it had a poor network connection in the status of the UI. I tried upgrading the firmware as well as tried multiple ethernet cables 2 of which I wired myself to be sure that wasn't the issue but not success. Tried each cable on the old router and they worked just fine with 4 computers online and actively streaming a 4k video from Youtube. Tried different computers connected first then second even tried different ports for each with the same issue after things running smoothly for an hour or two. Didn't seem to matter what I the computers were doing from gaming to just basic web browsing a few hours in just no internet all of a sudden.The only way to fix the issue with the connection would be to power off the router (software reboot did not work) and power it back on manually and wait for it to reconnect in roughly 2-5 min.The wifi range was great way better than I had before but the device has a limit of active wireless devices that can be used at once. I attached my smart plugs (3) and Alexa/Google Home (2 Alexa 1 Home) and when it came time to attach my tablets and phone it began knocking devices off just as soon as I added them none of the setting would allow more than 5 on the network at once. I tried removing the plugs and the smart assistants and tried just my tablets and phones but when I would get to the 6th device it would connect then immediately disconnect until I took one of the others off the wifi. I also tried using a combination of the 2.4 and the 5g but that didn't work either even tried it with no wired devices connected and still had the same 5 wifi connection limit.I spent hours in the various menus in the UI but even in the advanced settings its missing a lot of basic settings like manually setting device IP and even basic connection diagnostic.I contacted support and after 3 days still haven't gotten a response other than the generic auto Covid-19 telling me there is a delay in support issues but at this point I just decided to send it back and try another brand.,Wifi has a small device limit!,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",3 people found this helpful

The range is excellent and the connection is a whole lot more stable than my last router, with one exception; QoS. This ""envisioning"" of QoS as we'll call it, is frankly a joke in terms of limiting access to certain devices on my home network. I have a very unstable connection which relies on a satellite to get my internet, so making sure that I can get the most out of the amount of bandwidth I'm limited to is crucial. With my old TP-Link router I was able to throttle speeds of certain IP addresses to whatever speed I wanted which made the internet accessible to anyone who came over and didn't let bandwidth hungry devices like streaming boxes make everyone visibly upset. This amazing feature got replaced with QoS, which in theory is somewhat better because this goes by MAC addresses rather than IP addresses, so I don't have to keep going into my router settings to make sure someone isn't being throttled. But the implementation is complete utter GARBAGE. When I enabled QoS I'm not able to set speeds but rather a ""priority"" list for certain devices, which isn't that big of a deal as it should probably do a good job of limiting bandwidth to certain devices as I see fit... but no... this completely throttles your own connection to make everything else ""smooth"" which is a complete utter joke. I went from having a stable 40MBPS to just 10MBPS when switching this feature on, which completely defeats the purpose of using it. Why would I enable this feature when it ultimately makes everyone's speed worse rather than just one or two devices? I seriously hope TP-Link can tweak this feature in the future and let the user have that controlled functionality back because if it wasn't for this crucial flaw, I would be extremely happy with my purchase. This complaint thankfully can be fixed with a firmware update, but I seriously doubt they will implement this back",Great router with one main flaw,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",4 people found this helpful

However, in my lan, I need devices addressed from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.1.254.  This required a custom subnet mask.  I configured the lan for 192.168.0.1 / 255.255.254.0.  I general this worked ok.  All of my devices were able to operate on the lan.  However, I found that management interfaces of some of my devices weren't able to be accessed.  For some reason, when I tried to access a wifi access point at 192.168.1.2, the connection failed with a time-out.  However I was able to access a camera at 192.168.1.20.I reported this to TP-Link, and got the response that ""1.

If you want to reach all those fixed IP address devices, you need set up same subnet's IP address for them.""This response make very little sense to me.  Their suggestion was to use a subnet mask 255.255.255.0 which will limit my address range, and move any devices into that address range.I would have expected that they would have been interested in the failure so that they could report the scenario back to their development staff.Aside from this failure mode, the router is a good router.  I've had to reconfigure my network to accommodate the addressing failure, but I like some of the features the router provides.  I particularly like the ddns feature.  In the past I've used a free ddns service that requires periodic confirmation.  With the tp-link service, you set it once an don't have to reconfirm it.  I also like the ftp feature that allows external secure access to the USB flash drive connected to the router.Bottom line is that this is a good router for most home lan configurations.  But beware if your configuration is more complicated.Update 11/13/2019:  I have discover a new limitation that seriously limits this router.  I upgraded my connection to gigabit.  If I connect directly to the modem, I see speeds in the 700-800 mbit.  When I connect through the A7 router, the best speed I see is 350 mbit.

My kids started to complain about the lagging zoom sessions and online games. So I had to return it and find a different solution. I switched into Arris SB6183 + Archer A7 and I concluded that (1) we don't need to have a faster modem than SB6183 if the cable plan is slower than 100mbps, and (2) we don't need to have a router better than this for a house of 2000 sqft (if the router is at the center of the house, the coverage will increase). However, let's say that the wifi coverage is not good enough because of the weird layout of your house or simply because your house is bigger than 2000 sqft.

I really do. But...The pros: fantastic coverage, through all rooms in our 3-bedroom apartment, past obstacles such as the HVAC, even a fair distance outside. Handles a huge number of devices; we have 2 desktops, 3 laptops, 2 phones, 4 tablets, several video games, and a multitude of smarthome devices, and this router handles them all. Great speed, easily passes through the max speed provided by my ISP's modem, both through the ethernet ports and wifi.The cons: the software/firmware is lousy. As such, it doesn't deliver on several features promised. I don't have menu options referred to in the manual, despite the router telling me I have the latest firmware. I do not have the options for either smarthome or (almost any of) the ones for USB. As a result, I can not control the router with Alexa (minor issue) and can not access the hard drive I attached as a media server (big issue). Half the time I can't even access the router software at all, even if attached with an ethernet cable. Also, it seems to have a problem with some social media sites - I usually have to turn off the wifi on my phone and rely on mobile data when accessing those sites.Overall, as a router it provides fast, wide area coverage. But it does not deliver the features advertised. I'm not returning it because it does the important things well, especially for the price. But I wouldn't recommend it because it does not provide the features that convinced me to buy it.","Mixed feelings, but can't recommend","Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",2 people found this helpful

I keep trying to make this thing worth the money, but it isn’t even worth $20. It’s now typical for it to convey half the speed of the original ATT router (ATT=178 Download & 57.6 Upload, TP-Link=82.8 Download & 36.6 Upload). Absolutely ridiculous. Just don’t waste your money and time like I have.UPDATE: 3 months in and I’m back to where I started. It’s now clear that this is no better than the basic att router. I suppose I’ll just try to sell it off on Facebook and try a WiFi extender at this point. Oh well.UPDATE: I have no idea what I’ve done but the speeds are now better with only about a 40% degradation through walls. I had to move my PS4 outside of the tv cabinet as it would seem that particle board is akin to lead when it comes to WiFi. Either way, I’m happier and updating from 3 to 4 stars. Although if this becomes a routine thing, I’ll reduce to 1 star and go ask the neighbor with the big truck if he wants to run over this router a couple dozen times.While the router is better than the one that comes with AT&T service, it’s not $60 better.Using this to actually provide WiFi and not as an access point or range extender, I typically get 10-20 mbps better than before when sitting right next to the router. However, with every step I take from the router, the speed drops 5-10 mbps, mind you this is still line of sight and no new obstructions.This brings another interesting bit. Once you go into another room, maybe 30 feet from the router, the speed drops from a little over 100 to around 60. I live in an apartment with thin walls.. THEN it gets better. If you have anything like a PS4 which sits inside of a tv stand, you get about 1/2 of what you do in the adjacent room meaning lagging is sometimes nonexistent and other times you lose connection altogether. So now I get 50 mbps download at best and typically 4-7 mbps upload whereas sitting next to it, download is over 100 and upload is over 60.On the brights side, the app is helpful if you have pesky neighbors who like to try to steal WiFi as it allows you to block certain IPs and easily change the password etc.Overall, I’m decently irritated by this purchase as it wasn’t terribly cheap especially when compared to the added benefit.",Meh at best,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",2 people found this helpful

The Linksys worked but not reliably of late and it was slow for a dual band router.  I opted to use the quick install and then tweak later using the full featured web interface.  The install using TP's Tether app from my iPhone worked but not without a few missteps--a failure to connect to the router at first using the 5G SSID worked once I tried with the 2.4G.  A second hiccup occurred when binding the router--it froze and I had to go back and repeat the step.  I could have just logged in to the router from a laptop but wanted to see how well the app worked.  I highly recommend this approach for newbies--as the steps involved and required knowledge of how routers work could prove a bit daunting for a total novice.  That said, once installed and configured with the same SSID and password as my old router to save having to reconfigure a lot of devices (including a Netgear extender) everything worked and the entire process took less than 45 minutes.  Once I had everything working I logged in to the full web app giving me access to the router through a thoughtfully designed interface .  I made my security tweaks, set up a guest network, enabled Alexa control and tested every device to be sure all was in good order and then made a backup of the configuration--having been forewarned that a firmware upgrade would cause me to lose what I had just done.  As it happened a firmware upgrade was indicated so I chose the automatic upgrade option but to my surprise everything stayed intact iso I did not have to resort to a restore from the backup--still I am a belt and suspender guy having sent too many years in IT and learning the lesson early on that what can go wrong will.  So--the big payoff was the throughput.  I used an app called Speedtest and was a very pleased to see a 3x improvement in download-regardless of which server I selected.  Upload was slightly better but that is not generally an issue.  My TV, Sonos products, 2 iPhones, extender, 2 computers and 2 Kindles all worked without any changes needed ( the virtue of keeping my SSID and passwords the same as before).  Performance is obviously much improved.  I would have given this a 5 star but for the two hiccups and a little more clarity in the basic quick setup about a few functions.  Otherwise as the title say it was a near perfect install and if this router lasts as long as the linksys.  Range has also improved greatly and I may not need the extender to get from the router to the most distant room but as the router is in a utility closet where the modem, Sonos bridge and a few other devices live I'll keep it up.  Our house is about 2,500 sq. ft if that gives you an idea of range.  The signal is robust from every room.",Almost perfect,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",2 people found this helpful

This was a huge improvement to my old NetGear of which on the 5 ghz connection I was maxing out at ~93 mb. This was very promising so I started switching over all our devices and checking the speeds. All the devices within line of sight and 15 feet radius was also reporting higher bandwidth. Some devices similar to the ~200 mb end where the worst was still hitting the ~90 mb range.The better bandwidth is the exact reason why I went with this router, the other being the router's advertised range. Up to 2500 sq. ft. - unfortunately I was not able to get the advertised range. In fact, this unit only extended my range a matter of several feet. My kids' pcs couldn't get a solid connect to the wireless signal and require a range extend. I was hoping I'd be able to get rid of the extender because the advertised range, but that isn't the case.Over all, the better bandwidth is the only win in my experience. I may have to play with the router more to see if I can get the advertised range. If I can improve the range, I will amend this review, but until then, the best I can give it is 3 stars.

The C7, for whatever reason, outperforms the A7. The C7 can reach 5 Ghz speeds of well over 120mbps, while this A7 struggles to reach 95 mbps. I updated the firmware and it made no difference.Other annoyances: The C7 is able to keep proper time by connecting automatically to an NTP Server. This C7, however, cannot connect to most servers. I did get it to connect finally to a Google time server, but the time was off by 7 months and 12 minutes, so I had to switch to manual time, which disables other options such as scheduled reboots. It drops connections randomly. It will just go completely brain dead. A reboot of the router brings it back to life, but like clockwork it'll go down in a few more days.It's interesting that this router is rated higher on Amazon than the C7 version. But my C7 has been a rock solid performer. It consistently maintains 2.4 and 5 Ghz speeds. I never have to touch it. The only difference, as I understand it, between the two routers is that one has a virtual server and the other doesn't, but I have to believe there are other differences in quality.Or maybe I just got one from a bad batch.TP-Links in this line are rock bottom priced and the quality reveals the chink in the armor. Don't expect to get more than two or three years out of them, which, given the price, isn't all bad. But this router that I am returning is just pure junk.

I turned off the router functionality on that unit, and connected it to this router, and the speed increase was instant.  Setup was easy, too.The Tether app makes running things from your smartphone pretty easy, too.  We have since received a speed increase from our ISP, and I have tested speeds as high as 400 mbps on the 5ghz band (100-160 is the normal average).  The 2ghz band is significantly slower (maybe around 50 mbps), but that's the nature of that band.The range is also greatly improved.  I would lose signal in various parts of our yard, but I can now go across the street and get high speed (I've tested as high as 63 mbps before our ISP increased our speed).If you're looking for a budget-friendly way to upgrade an older (especially if you don't have an AC router) setup, I recommend this router.

I ran into two big problems with it, however.  First issue when switching between router mode and access point mode (because I was evaluating this against another router), if you try to switch back to router mode it won't connect to the internet and requires a factory reset.  I tried this twice and had to factory reset it both times to get internet connectivity.The other big issue is that the 5Ghz connection randomly loses internet connectivity...  It'll still show connected to Wifi but there is no connection to the internet.  Reconnecting to 5ghz will solve the problem for a while but I can't make it a day connected to the 5ghz.  The 2.4ghz wifi works fine, 24/7/365 with no problems.  Apparently this is a known issue with Archer A7 and C7 routers, even for folks running ddwrt.

The speeds are amazing and the latency improvement is night/day. However the only thing I don't like is the speeds on the 2.4G, it's CONSIDERABLY slower than the 5G.

Even at farther ranges the 5G will always be superior in terms of speed. More likely than not I will be switching over to another router that has good both 2.4G and 5G performance however this unit is still a great buy and highly recommended.

Devices in the same room prefer to connect to a range extender on the other side of the house. Guess they don't like being too close to the Archer. Not sure if this is something that can be fixed through firmware upgrades, or positioning.2. It is impossible to assign more than 32 (!) reserved IP addresses via DHCP Address Reservation. That is not nearly enough for a smart home with 4 family members, because most SmartHome devices (such as Amazon echos, Chromecasts, smart bulbs, smart switches, etc) do not have the option of assigning a static IP. This is not a difficult issue to fix, and I'm sure the developers are aware of it, so here's hoping they will at least double the number to 64 (or even go up to 256) in some future firmware upgrade.3. The 5G has a relatively short range and minimal wall-penetrating power. Purchasing additional (Dual-band) Range Extenders is a must for larger homes. The TP_Link RE200 seems to work just fine with the A7, but has similar shortcomings.4. The range extenders will change the first 6 numbers of the MAC address of connected devices. Although I understand the need for this, it is still alarming when unexpected MAC addresses start appearing on the router, and makes monitoring online devices more difficult than it needs to be.5. The Tether application is useless for anything but performing a quick basic setup. The web application is much better, but lacks some simple conveniences such as the ability to sort the various lists, or increase the lists to show more than 8 devices at a time.6. The Alexa app could be better. On the plus side, having Alexa understand ""Teepee Lynx"" instead of TP-Link can be both frustrating and amusing.",Not as great as it seems,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",2 people found this helpful

Mine failed after 8 months, and trying to deal with TP-Link for technical support or warranty fulfillment is an exercise in futility.  Yet at this price I guess the ""rent"" for this unit is about $8 per month.""So I will just buy another one and hope it lasts at least that long again.""I stand by what I said about TP-Link technical support.  However, I was able to get this box to work again.  I did buy a replacement unit but have not opened it.  If my current one continues to work, I will probably return the replacement unit to Amazon unopened.My problems originated with the cable internet provider, Spectrum.  Somehow, my internet modem ""fell off the grid.""  Although we were getting internet service at home, Spectrum reported that our modem was ""off line.""  Then after the sixth day in this status our service stopped altogether.  It turned out that our modem needed to be ""provisioned"" again -- basically set up as though it was brand new service.  Spectrum used obsolete information to do this, so it took several phone calls and two technician visits to get a working internet signal to come out of the cable modem.  I could get internet service with a single computer plugged directly into the cable modem.  But the rest of the household was dark.The problem was that this TP-Link router would not ""shake hands"" with the cable modem.  The router could see the modem, but would not engage with it to deliver internet service to the router customers.  None of the troubleshooting advice in the TP-Link manual or from their chat-based technical support made the slightest difference.What finally did make a difference was this:  Holding the reset button in (with a bent paper clip) for more than 30 seconds.  The manual says more than 5 seconds is enough, but that's wrong.  After 30 seconds of reset, I was able to navigate to the router's setup screen from my laptop with a hardwired ethernet cable and re-initialize everything (language, time zone, type of service, etc.).  The router finally made a successful connection to the internet signal being provided by the cable modem, and now everything works.Things have been working now for a bit more than a week, so I suspect they will continue to work with this current box.  Clearly the initial blame for everything lies with Spectrum, which messed up our service by somehow un-provisioning it.  But the process of getting this router to work again was needlessly difficult, which is why I offer only four stars.Performance-wise, this unit is quite good, and better than a more expensive Motorola unit that I used previously.  The three antennas on the back seem to generate a very powerful wi-fi signal that easily covers our household.  The wifi signal is servicing two laptop computers, two iPhones, an iPad, a Kindle Fire tablet, an Apple TV box, and a Sony Blu-Ray player's online streaming functions.  They all seem to coexist happily.  The unit is also servicing a Brother printer/scanner and a third computer via hardwired Ethernet (there are four outlets on the back).For the price is seems pretty hard to beat.  And if I run into this kind of problem again I expect to be able to solve it much more quickly.","Works Great When It Works, Which Is Most of the Time","Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",One person found this helpful

It was easy to set up, the wifi signal was good, and the app was handy and easy to use. But the router died in the middle of a firmware update about a year and two months after I purchased it. At first customer service seemed great--they quickly acknowledged the device was faulty and said they'd send me a replacement since it was still under warranty.There were different shipping options--I could pay to send it back myself and then once they received it they'd ship me the replacement, no other charges, but that sounded like it would leave me without wifi for too long. So instead I chose to pay $15 immediately for them to ship me the replacement in 3-5 days, plus a prepaid return label, with the condition that if I didn't return the defective unit within 25 days of the date I submitted the request, I'd be charged the full price of the replacement router ($65). This was on 11/18. A week later the status of my request still said ""Preparing Shipping."" I was working from home and needed reliable internet, so I decided to get a router through my ISP and was quickly back online.I immediately sent a message asking TP-Link to cancel my request for a replacement router since the status indicated it still hadn't been shipped yet anyway, and I received a reply acknowledging receipt of my request. I also chatted a couple days later with someone through their website who told me that I just had to wait for an email letting me know the replacement had been canceled. Then this past Monday 12/7, 20 days after I had submitted my initial request for a replacement (which was supposed to be shipped in 3-5 days), a box showed up at my door with the replacement router I told them I no longer wanted.I received an email that same day telling me they had to receive the faulty router back BEFORE 12/15 or I would be charged full price for the replacement. So after they took their time shipping me the replacement even after I canceled, they left me with approximately 1 week to get the faulty router back to them, meaning I had to rush to get it to FedEx and now have to hope it will be delivered fast enough (something I have no control over) so that I don't have to argue with someone in customer service about removing the charge from my account.Based on this experience I cannot recommend this router or the company, and would not purchase from them again.

It got so complicated and confusing I returned it and reinstalled my old one.  Finally the old one gave out and I purchased this one.  So much easier!  That is important.  But there are a few things that will help eliminate some smaller frustrations that I think remain. First, you have two options for installing the router.  The first one is by phone app.  The other is by browser.  If you go by browser just make sure you have internet access.  I chose the phone app.  Be aware that if you do not already  have a TP-Link account you will have to create one before installation.  Be sure that your email is filled in at the top of that form.  The other thing is that you will need your SSID password which is at the bottom of your router.  If you have trouble with seeing small fonts it might be wise to have a magnifying glass handy.  When I went through this I noticed that there were two SSID's listed.  These are the numbers preceded by AD.  One had a _ (underscore) 5G after it and the other did not.  In my case (and probably yours) the password applies to the SSID with the 5G.  Once learned, the process to complete was quick and easy. It is also wise to follow the directions carefully which are very clear and well illustrated.  Be aware that if you have a modem with a backup battery, you will be asked to take it out when you are  disconnecting it.  Remember to reinstall it when you start powering back up.  Also, you are told to verify that the four LED lights are on.  Just know that this can take a few minutes when powering up. When you first plug the router in it will look like nothing is happening.  Be patient.Although I just installed this router, it seems to be doing a great job.

Specifically, Archer A20 routers which are very expensive and are already ""end of life"" and no firmware upgrade for OneMesh.  Hence why I was forced to purchase the very much less expensive A7 to hook it up to the A20 and get OneMesh from by Tp-Link RE220 extenders.  The A7 is an excellent router; works perfect with OneMesh; familiar interface; lots of great features for home use and small office, and has vastly improved and simplified my life as to not continuously play IT support for everyone in the house with respect to connectivity, availability and signal strength during this unfortunate, pandemic time of extremely heavy usage of Internet.

In the past I've used predominantly Cisco/Linksys or Netgear devices. Lately however, I have stop using Linksys devices because their reliability is not what it used to be. This router is replacing a two year old Linksys router. Routers utilize solid-state circuitry and shouldn’t be failing as often as they do.  Netgear router‘s seem to be reliable although my reason for not using Netgear is due to their awful firmware. I had a pair of Netgear nighthawk router’s set up in my house. Those routers were purchased because they supported OpenDNS which allows you to have very reliable and easy to configure content filtering for children and for advertisements. Despite the fact that the router Is advertised as supporting OpenDNS, Netgear pushed out an update which rendered OpenDNS unusable. Netgear partnered with Disney and are forcing you to use the absolutely awful and practically useless Disney circle content filtering for children. Not only does it not work and ends up filtering just about everything, rendering the computer useless, but there’s no way to turn it off and return to using OpenDNS.  I called tech-support about it and not only did they not even understand the terminology that I was using while discussing the problems with the router, but they were truly slow and stupid. For a simple question, it would take them five minutes to look up an answer when anybody with a grade C in high school computer science should be able to answer those questions.  They were idiots and I was stuck with a router that I purchased for a specific advertised function which they removed less than two months after I purchased the hundred dollar router brand new. That’s pretty pathetic and I won’t support Netgear any longer due to their unfair business practices. On The front and rear of my house, I employ two TP-Link WNR841N routers. They were only $20 when I bought them about five years ago. These two routers cover my front yard and my backyard for when I have guests over or am doing yard work.  These inexpensive routers have been running for all of this time, protected only by old candy boxes which I painted and sealed for exterior use. That being said, these two TP-Link router‘s have been outside in the weather at temperatures as high as 103 in the summer and as low as 15° below zero. They have never failed once. I never have to reboot them [although the firmware has an option to schedule automatic reboots which I do once per week to refresh DNS and NetBIOS entries], I never have to do any updates on them, and so far I’ve never had to replace them.  Over the last six or seven years I have been purchasing almost nothing but TP-Link  router‘s for people that ask me to help them with their network or computers. I have never gotten any complaints from anybody about their router, and the oldest one that I bought is about seven years old and it still works, although I’m not using it anymore because my two main routers need to support 802.11 AC. This is the second router of this model which I purchased. The first one was purchased for a friend of mine who had problems at his house with a D-Link router that stopped working after just over a year. That was about a year ago so far and he's never called about it. No news is good news; I assure you.  I bought this to replace my Netgear Nighthawk which I mentioned earlier. I installed it about two weeks ago and so far have not had a single issue with it. The interface is very fast and the WiFi signal is very reliable. The way they laid out the GUI Is nice but the menu on the left has a pretty big flaw.  The menu on the left employs a collapsible menu design which extends past the bottom of the screen if you open any of the menus, rendering the other options impossible to see or interact with. There is a scroll bar for you to use but the scroll bar is tiny and automatically disappears into the background so you don’t even know there’s a scroll bar there. TP-Link should re-think the menu design. I would also like to see them allow you to save changes per page without restarting the router. I experienced some minor inconvenience while setting up my router because on a couple of occasions I wanted to make multiple changes to the settings before rebooting the router and enabling those changes, however the router doesn’t provide a method for you to save changes without rebooting right away.

So, I did some research and listened to my son-in-law and got this TP-link router.  It was relatively easy to set up, the user interface is not as nice and clear as the other router I had but it has worked since I set it up.  So, that's a big win for me and sure cuts down on the frustration.  Of course I had to reconnect everything that had wifi with the other router but that was relatively painless.  The lights indicating connection status are on the front of the router and very clear and helpful.

The WiFi signal is consistently excellent, even in the crowded airwaves of an urban apartment and in the challenging environment of thick plaster walls and steel girders. Configuration is easy and intuitive for basic features, albeit somewhat limited in terms of configurability of advanced features. The ability to have the same SSID for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks and for devices to switch back and forth between bands seamlessly depending on which signal is better is great. (That also applies to the Guest networks.)The major caveat is that this is a budget router. It's a great value for the price, but it's still a budget router. If your needs are simple and your network is reasonably uncrowded, there's nothing not to like about the Archer A7. Unfortunately, my network has a large number of devices on it with high inter-device bandwidth consumption (video streams, etc.), which overwhelmed the Archer A7's single-core processor and limited RAM. This caused my wired network speeds to slow down to 60% of the speeds I got with a different, more powerful router.TP-Link technical support is fair. The front-line agents are based in Asia, and hold times were long at times. The agents tried to be helpful but had limited resources at their disposal, particularly for my atypical situation. When I was finally told that a Level 2 technician would call me back, the promised time for the call came and went three times. Eventually, and with much persistence, I was able to get hold independently of an empowered, technically savvy manager in the U.S., and he was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and supportive. He went out of his way to make up for the earlier difficulties, and he made everything right. After assessing my needs, he was able to guide me to a more appropriate, more powerful router, and he made all the arrangements for me. He went above and beyond.I wish the experience with the front-line agents hadn't been so difficult, but the manager (C.M.) made up for it and convinced me that TP-Link is a good company that, in the end, cares about its customers' satisfaction and wants to see its products performing well.","A excellent budget choice, but possibly not for the power user","Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",

Both of my hdtvs will not connect to websites with “y*utube” in the web address or any other search word I pick such as “f*cebook”.I can pick what hours to allow internet access for each device daily.  Another feature I like about this router is the smart WiFi option.  Instead of two separate WiFi networks one for 2G and one for 5G we only have one network.  The router will pick the fastest network for each device 2.4 or 5 GHz and switch when needed.  Inside my house I get max speed on 5 GHz.  When I go outside my iPhone switches to the slower 2.4 GHz since that signal reaches farther than 5 GHz.

In fact the entire set of advanced security features in the router is disabled because they just don’t display that entire tab when in ap-mode.  Would have been nice to know.  Second, you can’t specify a channel for 2.4 ghz band in ap-mode unless you also disable the ability to do band switching on the router (using a single said for both bands).  Also, and this one baffles me most, tp-link wants you to input all MAC addresses with hyphens instead of colons.  Not a big one, but I have never seen a MAC formatted that way.

I bought this to replace an old cable router that I kept having to restart. Right out of the box it’s an easy quick setup with the Tether App. It worked great right from the start except I do recommend if you have a lot of different devices that will be running off of this router and you don’t usually have the fastest speeds, that you stagger your devices between 2.4 and 5ghz. The default settings for this device is for it to run as a smart router which means it will switch back and forth from one ghz to the other for whichever is the fastest. That’s fine if you have a significant speed to keep up all of your devices easily but my internet isn’t like that. Mine fluctuates too much for that to be reliable so I turned off the Smart choice in the settings and chose to separate with a different WiFi name. I try to keep the same amount of devices that I run regularly on each ghz in each room. For example if I have my PS4 running on 2.4ghz then I’m going to have my Firestick in that room on 5ghz.

Worked well for about a year then starting going in and out. It was intermittent at first so I dealt with it - but last couple months it has been getting worse and worse. Sometimes it would say I was connected to wifi but the internet connection would drop (while wired devices worked fine) and other times it would just lose the wifi connection until I reset the router. Also none of the lights on the front were lighting, making it very hard to diagnose issues or status.Anyway - this isn't to review the other router but just to say that when I plugged in this new router I was instantly blown away by the improvements. Not only did my connections all improve dramatically (after several hours' use have not lost connection once) but it also bumped my speeds by a good 50mbps. Before I was getting about 70 (on a good day/connection) now I'm getting around 120...all with the same internet service.The coverage also seems superior - easily stretches to all corners of my 1BR. Another improvement is that this has 4 ethernet ports, where my last router had only one. Now I can hardwire both my ps4 and HDTV for better performance. Also has a companion app that made setup a breeze, as well as a healthy array of status lights on the front.All in all very happy so far.

After consulting with Optimum, my cable provider, regarding compatability, they reluctantly walked me throught the procedure to convert my rented equipment to my own equipment.  This TP Link router came highly reccomended here on Amazon and it is thus far working very well.  This router broadcasts seamlessly on 2.4 or 5ghz for increased reliability.  Since I keep my router in my attic, I had to swap out old for new and configure my WiFi again, but this was a relatively simple for anyone tech saavy but could pose a problem for others; that said I am far from a computer guy but was able to do this hookup in short order.  The other issue was relinking any devices to the new WiFi; again a simple process but depending on the extent of your WiFi devices, it could be time consuming.  Since I had a family's worth of cell phones, a Ring Alarm system, Nest thermostats, a few Echos, a Playstation and two smart TVs, (I'm sure there are others), it took a bit, but overall this was worth it due having a more modern router and mostly for saving the $12 monthly rental fee which will have this router paying for itself in about 5 months.

So I know I had internet but this router was receiving it for some reason. So I figured it was a settings problem within the router. I have my internet and modem thru Charter. So if you have those you may experience what I had too. I called TPlink support and had to wait a long time. After a while I ended up just using the chat feature in support. Which I had to wait quite some time as well. While waiting for the chat to come on I searched online for solutions and found two. So I gave up my 15 minute wait and just tried to figure it out myself. Thats why I gave their customer support a low rank because it took way to long to get an employee. The first was to change the DNS, which worked for a day. So then the next day I changed the LAN IP address and so far that has been working. Its been 2 days so far.

A few small issues which are mostly just things I want to work a certain way.  Worth the price.Pros: A lot of good features and options, not hard to find or figure out how to use. Signal works well.  Options for separate SSID and a guest network to have in, or keep separate from your network as well as not allowing guests to see each other. QoS, profiles, and parental controls for devices is nice and works well.  Several other options I haven't even used or needed yet also available. Overall a solid performance for a wifi router and it's come a long ways from the original ones which just did signal and security.Cons: To be fair most of this is going to be a bit of nit-picking on my part.I wanted more than 8 devices per profile, and I wanted more than 4 profiles (we have a lot of devices). I wanted more options in QoS, so that after work hours we could swap it out.

I checked carefully to be sure it was new and not repackaged. Set it up and performance was dismal. Average internet speed tests were 2 to 10 MPS, dropping to less than 1 MBPS after an hour of playing with quick fixes on the net like changing NAT boost settings, etc. My ISP provides 200 MBPS, verified by bypassing my router and connecting my PC directly to my modem. When I went through my seven year old router my speed dropped to 90 MBPS, slower but still much faster than the new router.

It's connecting to a router about 30~ft away, downstairs, has a line of sight almost, but there is a door/wall in the way, where the main router is kept.  In order to do this, I have to setup a WDS.  It's fairly easy to do, but the web interface is quite slow, which seems to be the trend for routers.  I also dislike how I had to connect to it.  Why didn't it just tell me the ip, so I could connect to it, like every other router I've had? ...  (I used the ip after setting it up, but originally I didn't know what the ip was for this router and it took trail and error) ...I would use the 5ghz WDS mode, but it keeps crashing anytime I use it for downloading or transferring files.  If it is a quick webpage load of a video stream it does alright.  If I'm downloading a game on my desktop, it will crash the router.  If I transfer files from my laptop to my server, it will crash the router. (laptop on the 5ghz wifi, of this A7 router)  It seems to restart itself, but it doesn't.  So I have to manually restart it, which takes about 2 painful minutes for whatever reason.I've tried to update the firmware, which was confusing on what version I was changing it to.  For a little bit I thought I had some super new firmware that wasn't listed on their website, but it turns out there was newer firmware.  But that didn't fix anything.  For now I am setting on the slower 2.4Ghz WDS.  I'm only connecting to my main router for internet, which is about 128Mb Down, at it's peak.  Which 2.4Ghz is good enough for, but it does seem like it needs to build up to speed, compared to the 5Ghz WDS.On this A7 router, I have transferred files from a laptop with 5Ghz, to a server with RJ-45 Gigabit at over 400Mb.  Although, to do this I had to put the laptop right next to it.  If I had it about a foot away, right below it, I got about 350Mb.  (MB = MegaByte Mb = Megabit same for GB-Gb, KB-Kb)I'm overall disappointed with the 5Ghz WDS crashing the router and the web interface speed/setup.Edit:  I decided to fiddle with it again after initially writing this review.  I thought the internet was just going slow because of the ""internet shortage"" I was hearing about.  I think it's just how slow this router is.  Doing a speed test, the 2.4Ghz WDS gets about 55 down, 22up.  However there have been times where I'm getting 32 Down.  But if I use my laptop and connect to the main router, I get the full 128 Down and 100~ Up speeds.  I was trying to get the 5Ghz WDS to work again and couldn't see my main router at all!  It didn't even see the 5Ghz repeater we have.  I kept finding other devices though.

This router continues to have some bad days where it just cannot stay connected to my Charter Spectrum modem for more than a couple hours at a time. It’s not the modem, as my old router still works fine with it, and fixing the connection involves rebooting the TP-Link router only. I’m cutting my losses and buying a Ubiquity Edge wired router, and demoting this thing to be an access point only. It's just not reliable, but I'm hoping it works well as an access point, as that part of it has never failed.Update 9/21/2020Just FYI - I am on the current firmware, that was the first thing I did after connecting to the router admin. The problem described below has subsided. I don't know if it just needed time to work itself out with the Spectrum modem, of if something I actively did fixed it. I did two things. I set the router to reboot itself nightly. It also seemed like my 2nd gen Apple TV may have been causing problems for the router. When I changed my DHCP address pool right after setting up the router, the Apple TV was insisting on keeping its old IP address, which was now outside of the DHCP pool I wanted to use. I unplugged the Apple TV, since it's old and I don't really use it. That also coincided with the router's problem going away. My router has the same SSID as my old one, with the same WPA2 password. All my other devices worked seamlessly with the new router, except the Apple TV. If I connect the Apple TV back up, I will try having it forget it's network settings and start from scratch. As of now, no problems, and the Archer has gotten a reprieve.I really wanted to like this router. The features are what I wanted, speeds are fast, and wifi coverage is excellent. It's just too flaky. The main problem is that it disconnects from my cable modem randomly, at least twice per day. When this happens, the WAN light on the router goes from green to amber. Sometimes it will be in the process of failing for several minutes before it goes to amber. The login for the router management interface can also become unresponsive. I have to reboot both the router and the cable modem (Cisco DPC3208 - provided by ISP), even though the cable modem still has a blinking link light to the WAN. I followed the setup routine after logging into the router. There's nothing special about my configuration. My network was very reliable with my old router, (Buffalo Airstation WZR-600DHP).

First you have to unplug the ethernet modem and connect the router to the modem making sure the router is not turned on.  After connecting, turn on the ethernet modem and wait at least 2 minutes to make sure all the lights are turned on.  Then turn the router power on and wait another 2 minutes or so until the internet light turns from red to green. It's ready then and you can connect from the phone or laptop or whatever.

You're gonna need extenders and stuff for an upstairs/downstairs. Still trying out the official TP-Link extenders to see the speed.SPEED/PING:The 2ghz speed is kind of crap from what I've seen, but that's kind of to be expected. I don't really use it so I can't say for sure. Anywhere from 10-50mbps.On the 5ghz after optimizing it, I hit over 400mbps on my phone and laptop even in the room nextdoor, which is pretty good.  On my phone it's supposed to be technically capable of 1.2gbps but it usually shows 940mbps in my internet options. Still, it's not reaching near the amount. I'm not sure if the bottleneck is the router or my phone/laptop, as I've never been on a faster connection than my home network.Wired speed - I hit about 940mbps wired into the router compared to 1004mbps wired into my modem. This is reflective of what the wifi connection is showing under internet options, although this is wireless. Maybe there's something with the cable or my Verizon modem limiting the output speed. I'm using the provided ethernet cable. Still, not bad for something that's extended my network. Ping is great. I haven't done gaming on this router (yet?) but in all my speedtests I'm getting around 6ms ping on wifi and wireless. Should be pretty great for gaming because I haven't had any dips in the speed or connection.OPTIMIZING:You're gonna want to split the wifi channels, as it's set by default. Name one of them MyWifi 5G and the other MyWifi 2G for clarity. There's an automatic switching feature but it's not perfect, as it often bases it on signal instead of speed, so my Fire Stick was using the 2ghz.Use a wifi scanner like Vistumbler to find out what channels other people are using nearby. For me, a lot of people were using channels 149 and 161 (or 167 I forget) for 5ghz. I found that 157 worked best for me. You can do the same for 2.4ghz.Misc/Comments:I guess I hoped for a bigger range on this. It's great because not it works well downstairs, and it will work even better once I get the extenders running. It doesn't work too great outside with our smart plugs so I'm grabbing a cheap second wifi extender.

They first had me limit my own MBS to only 100 for stability when I am supposed to get 400+. I noticed the CPU fluctuating a lot. Mentioned this to the person on the phone. He said, it's nothing. Person on the phone kept trying to have me get off the phone because it was Friday at 5:00, so I did. I followed up with an email and that was of no help at all. They just simply moved me to the next person in line that may be of more use. I googled why CPU is important in routers and here we are.

I had it for more than 5 years (maybe 7), and it did its job wonderfully.So, after looking at many devices and their corresponding reviews, I chose this one the Archer A7 or TP-Link AC1750 as it has one of the lowest 1 star rating (10%).Unboxing, and installing took a short time, and everything seemed to work as expected. I was looking through the menus and activated the ARP Binding feature which lets you manually bind an IP to a MAC, a rather common feature in all the routers I've had. Again, no problem, and everything was nicely working... or so I thought. Next morning, almost all my devices did not have internet connection.Imagine trying to fix the internet connection with all your family anxiously breathing down your neck. A simple reboot seemed to fix the issue, but after few hours, it appeared again. I ended up rebooting the router 2-3 time every day.The problem: although my computers could connect to the router they could not get an IP. To make it even more confusing, the router logs showed delivering an IP to each of the requesting computers every time one was asking for it.I decided to return it, and there were no question asked, I immediately got a return label.Next step, I ordered another router, a Linksys, this time. Pricier, and more powerful, but with problems, too. I could not set my preferred DNS servers, so I returned it, and went back to the initial choice (TP-Link AC1750). I still had my unit and decided to give it another try before send it back.After many attempts, I think I found the culprit: it is the ARP Binding feature. If you enable it, and bind one IP to a MAC, that computer will loose its internet connection after several hours. The moment it gets unbounded everything returns to normal.Now that I know the issue, it is more of an annoyance, and I decided to keep the unit. But still, for all the headache it gave me, I labeled it with 1 star only!#################################Returning after ~2 months of heavy usage, I can say that it works at an acceptable level of reliability. The problem is that the router itself temporarily looses its internet connection 2-3 times/week.

The main difference with this router is that you cannot name the two different bands (5G & 2.4) differently so if you have smart devices and other users connecting to the different bands, even if you name the new router the same as the old, some devices may have to be reconfigured.

We've had it running for a month now and I have no regrets.  I use a wired Ethernet connection for work from home, which is just as fast as plugging directly into my cable modem, and the WiFi speeds are great too, around 300-400Mbps in the rooms nearest the router and around 200Mbps in the rest of the house.  Those speeds are plenty fast for even the most demanding streaming or gaming.  I have had no problems with slow ping, dropped packets, lagging connections, or buffering, even with 10 or more devices connected both WiFi and wired.  Would recommend for anyone wanting to upgrade their speed above 100Mbps.  For reference, our home is about 2400 sq ft, two story, the cable modem has to be in the corner of the house in the family room near the garage, so it is quite far away from the rest of the house and the upstairs bedrooms.  We do have a TP-Link WiFi extender in the upstairs bedrooms farthest away from this router, and that helps with the speed and stability upstairs.  Overall this is a very good router that handles faster internet speeds well.","Very fast, handles multiple devices easily, Tether app makes setup and maintenance easier","Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",

I just don't think the CPU can handle it.I would have speed tests spike up to 400mbps or more and then very quickly come back down to average around 250. If I plug into the modem, it's 800 to mid 900s every time. I spent a fair amount of time researching this model and the issue with gigabit internet and I was not able to find any clear cut solution. I found one forum post where a couple of people said they were able to get it to work through a method similar to throwing salt over your shoulder and spinning around clockwise three times. I tried turning off every security and traffic management feature I could find and I just couldn't get it to test over 250Mbps reliably.If your internet is 300Mbps or lower, I think this router will work great for you.

The router has a good set of features, very good user interface by current standards, and the smartphone app is fantastic. When it's working correctly, the router performs quite well for its price.Unfortunately there are issues here and there. First, the QoS feature needs some adjustment to account for what I assume is overhead. My cable service is 100Mbit down, 8Mbit up. Setting QoS to those numbers will result in the router limiting speeds to about 80Mbit down and 6Mbit up. After some adjusting, setting the QoS to 115 down / 11 up resulted in the router approximately limiting the speeds to the 100/8 connection, with fair queuing among connected devices.Another issue, which is unfortunately a show-stopper for me, is that the WAN connection will intermittently drop out throughout the day. After about 4-5 hours online, the dropouts begin to occur roughly every 60-90 minutes. Packet loss will spike to all clients, wired or wireless, and also on the web frontend's diagnostic ping test. This spike will generally last a couple of minutes at most. Unfortunately this makes the router useless for many applications beyond simple web browsing - VoIP, streaming, and VPNs are particularly susceptible to breakdowns as a result.Sadly this means I'll be sidelining this router for the time being in the hopes that a firmware fix may be forthcoming. In the meantime, I'll be using an older router that doesn't perform quite as well but is more reliable.UPDATE 10/17/19 - Further research and testing determined NAT Boost (TP-Link's hardware NAT implementation) was the cause of the WAN dropouts. Disabling NAT Boost will yield a stable connection, but at the cost of speed. The router can only sustain about 40Mbit/s downloads due to CPU limitations with NAT Boost off.Because I feel the router is not working as designed, I will be leaving the review at 2 stars. If your needs are compatible with the frequent dropouts while NAT Boost is on, or your internet service is limited to less than 50Mbit/s download, you may still find this router useful.","Archer A7 v5 - Choose WAN Dropouts with Nat Boost on, or Slow Speeds with it off","Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",One person found this helpful

I then decided to try the AC 1750 and it performed poorly day and night on the remote devices.  However, I then added a Re300 mesh device and it works great all the time now.Recommendation:  If you have a small coverage area (or can centrally locate the router), only want to buy one wifi router, and DO NOT need a USB port on the router for a media drive then go with the AC 1200 as it definitely has the strongest wifi signal and best penetration through walls.

I also bought a TP-Link RE305 range extender to go with it. The router was relatively easy to set up. I had it plugged in and running in no time. The range extender was another issue. And although this is a review of the router, not the range extender, the only reason I mention it is because I was on a chat session with TP-Link Tech Support trying to get the range extender to work. They were VERY patient and chatted with me for a very long time and found that the solution was a firmware upgrade to the router. So I give TP-Link Support high marks for that. The reason I gave the router such a low overall rating is because the range of the router, even with the range extender, was not at all what I expected. The wifi speed seemed to drop off rather sharply when I got what I thought was not that far from the router. Now, I know that there are many factors that can affect the router's performance, but I was seeing behavior that I thought was not acceptable. So ... I bit the bullet and shelled out the money for a router that cost $200+ more than the TP-Link router. I bought (through Amazon) a Netgear Nighthawk R8000P.

I’m no tech savvy kind of guy, but I suppose I know enough to get by in today’s culture. Not as bad off as others that trust there ISP to rent a router, no thank you. I was pleasantly pleased with the user friendly interface, and as I placed my router upstairs not having to spend time in the s second floor of the house in SC summer heat. Anyways it was easy to setup and easy to use and setup security protocols, along with restarting or fixing issues. The router came with a free app in which you were able to setup everything from. I’m not sure if the bump is WiFi speeds were from the ISP or from the router itself. I’ve been to a couple other houses of family and friends with similar speeds, and similar number of devices, only thing that was different was the router, and this router seems in comparison, working far better.

I was hoping I could do the same here, which is not the case. If this is something you're looking to take advantage of, you'll need one of TPLink's repeaters or extenders. I REALLY hope TPLink changes this, as ASUS allows two routers to mesh like that as do some other brands. But, while this DOES warrant a dropped star, TPLink advertises the units in a way that makes it really feel like they support this on multiple routers when that just isn't true, it still was a cakewalk to set the second one up as an access point, and the UI is clean, simple, and efficiently designed.

But 3 months after purchase, its ethernet jacks started getting spotty. At random times the internet would just cut out for about 5 minutes, and then resume. Directly connected my computer to my modem and all was fine. So, problem with the router. Weathered the problem for about another 3 months before it started becoming a really annoying.Step 1: Contact Amazon!Long story short, Amazon told me I'm **** out of luck, but they'll give me the phone number for TP-Link customer service.Step 2: Call TP-LinkAgent #1: Tried to tell me that my internet wasn't working because my ethernet cable wasn't plugged into the router. Took a bit for him to understand that I'm plugged into the modem because the router is broken. Walked me through updating the firmware of the router, which I admittedly forgot during my own trouble shooting.Agent #2: Called back a fer hours later when it was clear that the firmware update didn't fix the problem. Agent#2 was actually helpful in promising me a replacement router, but I had to first register my current hardware. He sent me and email with the steps and wished me luck.Step 3: Registering the RouterAgent #3: I had to get in touch with Agent#3 because the aforementioned email took me to a registration system that didn't want to accept my router's serial number. Checked it a bunch of times, and despite being correct, the system disagreed. Agent#3 told me this was happening because I didn't legitimately purchase the device. After hitting him with various images of proof of purchase from Amazon, the S/N number under the machine itself, and a shot of the registration system rejecting the number, he tersely told me to try again. Worked like magic. But first I had to deal with his insulting behavior and comments.After all that, is the problem solved? Don't know. Maybe. It's in limbo now. Let's see if they actually send a replacement as promised. But why did it go bad in less than 6 months from purchase? Why was Amazon unhelpful? Why were 2 out of 3 of TP-Link's agents condescending? WHY did I have to contact an agent to make the system accept the serial number on the BOTTOM OF THE MACHINE? Good questions.Buyer ****ing beware.UPDATE: Received a second email shortly after. Apparently TP-Link requires me to pay for the very expensive shipping and handling for my replacement. Now, I know for a fact that shipping something of this router's weight costs appr. $8. USD. They want much more. So, they're trying to profit off their faulty product. I think I'll just pay full price for another router made by another company, and wash my hands of TP-Link.",What a Nightmare,"Model: AC1750, WiFi 5 RouterVerified Purchase",
