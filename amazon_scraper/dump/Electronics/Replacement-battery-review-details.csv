It came with, about a ""75%,"" charge.  I installed it on my old HP Pavilion G7 which had a ""minor"" charge on it (35%), BUT, it wasn't ""charging"" with this battery pack plugged in.  So, I decided to bring the G7 down to nothing, but as I played (and watched the scale slowly sink), when it reached ""2%"" it suddenly started charging.  I turned the computer off and checked it periodically and lo, it was charging.  I waited until it it reached 100% and started playing a game.  It HAS to get down to 2% before it starts recharging for some reason (at least ""this"" one).  But, (and this is a good but..), it maintains it charge a LONG time, I go weeks playing the old Battlefield 2 games, old Dooms, Fighter Ace and a few others and this thing keep clickin' along.  Since getting it in middle of last year (2019), it's on it's 3rd overall charge and down to 18% now.  Ironically, unlike my other computers, it will not charge while turned off and plugged in.  But, wait (and use it on something unimportant) let it get to 2%, get off it and let it do it's thing.  It'll continue to charge as you use it at that point.  Not sure what the 2% deal is,  My other PC's stay around 100 with the ""stock"" packs.  But for something like a dedicated gaming computer... it does fine.
