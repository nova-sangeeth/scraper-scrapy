All have been 100% reliable over many years.  (So far!)  I think I there are still some 4GB units in daily use that continue to work flawlessly!  Unfortunately, I can NOT say the same about the SanDisk Cruzer CZ36 64GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive, SDCZ36-064G-AFFP.I bought my first 64GB model some time ago.  In fact it was the SAME EXACT MODEL and it FAILED the SAME EXACT WAY as the one I just bought about a week ago.My first 64GB drive decided to put itself into '-WRITE PROTECT MODE-' shortly after the 30 day warranty ran out so I could not return it for a refund.  Based upon my experience with other Sandisk products I figured it was an isolated event and forgot about it since it was beyond the 30 day return period and there was nothing I could do about it anyway.  Meanwhile, my old workhorse Sandisk 8 and 16GB SanDisk cruzer flash drives continued to work flawlessly.Oh how I wish I had read the reviews for the 64GB model before purchasing another one!!!I am a software developer and need a reliable device for backing up daily modifications to code that I write.  I got about a week into my daily backup routine when all of a sudden I could no longer write to the SanDisk 64GB flash drive.  Since I was using this on a Linux system I figured the read/write permissions somehow got changed.After rebooting the machine and numerous checks with no change, I removed the 64GB Sandisk Flash from the system in question and tried it in several other computers.  In fact, I tried it in every computer I had available to me and that includes systems running MSDOS, Windows 95, 98, XP, WIN7 and WIN10 as well as various Apple products running OS X, Android products with OTG ports, and of course the workhorse Linux computers which include several model Raspberry Pi including the latest Raspberry pi 3.SAME ISSUE!It appears my 1 week old SanDisk Cruzer CZ36 64GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive, SDCZ36-064G-AFFP had put itself into -WRITE PROTECT MODE-', the same exact failure mode of the previous unit.  That's when I decided to check reviews on Amazon and this time sorted the reviews for this specific model flash drive and was shocked by what I saw.Come on now.  518 critical reviews (?) and a very high number of them all claiming the same issue with the drive going into permanent write protect mode?  That doesn't raise come kind of red flag that there is a serious issue with this device?So here is my present situation.I can not return the device for a refund without seriously compromising the proprietary in house source code which is now permanently stored on this device.  The only solution is to back the data up to something more reliable then destroy the 64GB drive since there is no way to erase the data stored on that device.I guess after I send this review to Amazon there will then be 519 critical reviews for this product.  If I could give it ZERO stars I would as I consider it as product with a SERIOUS design issue.  SanDisk may see this as a design feature (?) in order to '-PROTECT-' the data that is stored on the drive but in my case I see it as a VERY SERIOUS design flaw...",SanDisk Cruzer CZ36 64GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-AFFP has a serious design flaw where it becomes WRITE PROTECTED,Capacity: 64GBPackage Type: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase,"1,256 people found this helpful"

The first one arrived and did not work whatsoever.  It asked me from the very start to format the disk, and when I accepted this option (on my brand new computer), I figured out that I as a savvy homeowner could not format the disk and that it should have come already formatted for use with windows.  I applied for a return.  Unfortunately, I order online for a reason and do not have time to make a return so I ended up paying for it and its replacement in the end.  I ordered these for work and to carry important files that I wanted to back up and have with me as I travel.  The replacement worked as promised for about a month or a month and a half.  At this point, I was unable to save anything to the drive and thought maybe the computer was the issue.  I used some smaller usb's that i have and was able to operate them properly.  That is when I realized that my new Cruzer was already corrupted and that to attempt to restore it would mean that I would most likely lose all of my work.  Although I can access all of the files currently on the USB, I cannot add or delete any files making it useless for my needs.  It was irritating enough for the first one not to work, but now neither works.  If you are keeping important documents or anything you NEED or want to keep then I would spend my more money on something that will last.  I'm currently looking to buy another USB as I need it for work, but it will not be a cruiser.  In all fairness, I have not reached out to sandisk but knowing I lost my files is enough for me to try something else.",First one was not formatted and second one was corrupted within a month.,Capacity: 64GBPackage Type: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase,78 people found this helpful

I closed out of the vault, went back to the drive window and tried to open the vault. Lo and behold, it wanted me to start from scratch (accept user agreement and reset password).

The first question most people would ask is why. With 32, 64 and even 128 Gb drives costing only pennies more why buy such a small capacity? The easy answer is because that’s all I need. In today’s technology the most common media to use to make a restore disk for your computer’s operating system is with a USB thumb drive, for most laptops these days that’s the only media you can use. A typical restore disk needs between 9 - 12 Gb of storage room, making a 16 Gb drive the ideal capacity.WHY SANDISKA restore drive is one of the most task critical things I can do and it’s important to me to choose the brand I trust the most. To date I’ve never had a problem with SanDisk so choosing them for this task was an easy decision. As far as which model, out of a seemingly endless selection of choose from, this one has the feature that the plug end withdraws into a protective shell. That’s a plus if you’re concerned about data protection. And it has a large flat area on the side of the case to label the contents, a restore disk is useless if you can’t easily find it. The drive is small and easy store.SPEEDThe speed of drives like this isn’t always the most important thing (in fact it never is, data integrity is always first). Some tasks like restoring an operating system are going to run at the speed they want to, a faster drive isn’t going to make that much difference. Always choose dependability as your first priority.",Why only 16 Gb,Capacity: 16 GB - 2 packPackage Type: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,76 people found this helpful

I applied for a return.  Unfortunately, I order online for a reason and do not have time to make a return so I ended up paying for it and its replacement in the end.  I ordered these for work and to carry important files that I wanted to back up and have with me as I travel.  The replacement worked as promised for about a month or a month and a half.  At this point, I was unable to save anything to the drive and thought maybe the computer was the issue.  I used some smaller usb's that i have and was able to operate them properly.  That is when I realized that my new Cruzer was already corrupted and that to attempt to restore it would mean that I would most likely lose all of my work.  Although I can access all of the files currently on the USB, I cannot add or delete any files making it useless for my needs.  It was irritating enough for the first one not to work, but now neither works.  If you are keeping important documents or anything you NEED or want to keep then I would spend my more money on something that will last.  I'm currently looking to buy another USB as I need it for work, but it will not be a cruiser.  In all fairness, I have not reached out to sandisk but knowing I lost my files is enough for me to try something else.",First one was not formatted and second one was corrupted within a month.,Capacity: 64GBPackage Type: Frustration-Free PackagingVerified Purchase,78 people found this helpful

The first question most people would ask is why. With 32, 64 and even 128 Gb drives costing only pennies more why buy such a small capacity? The easy answer is because that’s all I need. In today’s technology the most common media to use to make a restore disk for your computer’s operating system is with a USB thumb drive, for most laptops these days that’s the only media you can use. A typical restore disk needs between 9 - 12 Gb of storage room, making a 16 Gb drive the ideal capacity.WHY SANDISKA restore drive is one of the most task critical things I can do and it’s important to me to choose the brand I trust the most. To date I’ve never had a problem with SanDisk so choosing them for this task was an easy decision. As far as which model, out of a seemingly endless selection of choose from, this one has the feature that the plug end withdraws into a protective shell. That’s a plus if you’re concerned about data protection. And it has a large flat area on the side of the case to label the contents, a restore disk is useless if you can’t easily find it. The drive is small and easy store.SPEEDThe speed of drives like this isn’t always the most important thing (in fact it never is, data integrity is always first). Some tasks like restoring an operating system are going to run at the speed they want to, a faster drive isn’t going to make that much difference.

SanDisk Cruzers have always been in my list of go-to drives for design and dependability. When my 6-year old 16GB Cruzer  was no longer big enough to hold all my portable apps and music, I knew I had to turn to another Cruzer for the same performance and guaranteed life expectancy. Why Cruzers, you might ask. Well, my 16GB  went through the wash a number of times and still worked after allowing it to dry out before using it. I also lost it in my garden while I was weeding the garden in the Fall. When planting in the Spring, I found the drive in the dirt. I cleaned it off with rubbing alcohol and let it dry out. After snow, rain, frost, thaw, etc., the darn thing still chugged along after I plugged it in. At that point, for me, I was sold on Cruzers for life.Admittedly, for me, transfer speeds aren't a major concern. I only use the drives for portable apps and music storage. Except for work laptops, which are newer but require encrypted devices, I use a much older Toshiba that has USB 2.0 jacks on it and have a Toyota Tacoma in which I use the drive to play music. So, 3.0 transfer speeds mean little to me and this 2.0 would work quite well. You have the option to download for free and use SanDisk's encryption software. I don't keep sensitive software on portable devices. So, I didn't have a need for it. I also reformat my drives, wiping them completely clean before using them. So, I don't use any pre-installed software, etc.The housing on this Cruzer is made of a thick plastic, quite substantial, but neither bulky nor heavy. The thing I really like about Cruzers is how the USB insert slides back in the housing to protect it; and, there is a built-in LED light that shows when the Cruzer is transferring data. The Cruzer has a small metal rod built into the housing, which would allow you to put a lanyard on it if desired. My one gripe about new Cruzers, and the reason for a four-star vs. a five, is that they no longer come with lanyards. Even cheaper drives come with lanyards. Cruzers should too, as the lanyard would allow you to attach the drive to your keys.Final Verdict: For dependability and endurance, I have no problems recommending the SanDisk Cruzer line of thumb drives. If this is anything like my old one, it'll give me (and you) years of life and data backup. If I have a reason to change my review, I'll do so ASAP.

I am returning the two new SanDisk drives to Amazon (that were considerably cheaper than the failed USB drive) and will never have any confidence in a SanDisk product.

The Cruzer remains flawless - I have even dropped it down a few flights of stairs I will confess!To sum up, don't hesitate if you need an affordable, portable option for data storage - it's a real bargain and as a flash drive it's equivalent to what a Volvo or Subaru is to automaker durability.","A great flash drive for audio in the car as well as for data transfer and storage (**UPDATE Feb 18, 2018**)",Capacity: 128GBPackage Type: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,10 people found this helpful

These thumb drives are no exception.I purchased two of them, and they connected immediately without me having to do anything.

When I plug them into the same machine I am told that one has 57.2 GB of space, and the other has 58.7 GB of space.  This is right out of the box.  So one is only capable of storing 89.3% of the advertise data amount and the other 91.7%.First off is the question why not 64 GB? Is it the formatting?  The software that comes pre-loaded on each drive only takes up 11MB, so that is not the reason.  The drives should ship with at least 99% over the advertised capacity.Second, why would two (supposedly identical drives) read a significantly different amount of space available.  The difference is 1.5 GB.Not sure the reasons for these discrepancies, but I can't rate them 5 stars when this happens.

Because they have no moving parts, I trust them more than a tradition drive with many moving parts. Also, because they are so small, I can backup an important shoot and then leave it offsite (or even mail it to a friend) for safety.

This Sandisk Cruzer (USB v 2.0, 64GB, Slide, Glide, whatever) conflicts with some fairly common cellphone software that I just happen to use (in varying degrees and from time to time) on both my desktop and laptop computers. The software are: (a) HTC Sync Manager (used with an AT&T branded HTC One X, and (b) Samsung Kies versions 2.0 and 3.0 (used with my AT&T branded Samsung Galaxy S III) on BOTH of my Windows 7 Professional 64-bit computers. Perhaps I am just unlucky that I purchased the wrong Sandisk Cruzer USB 2.0 drive, because BOTH of the software I use to periodically backup and restore BOTH of my cell phones. But, my entire home/office business relies on a Windows network, including 6, Windows 7 Professional workstations and 1, Windows SBS Server. In other words, the only way to get a $30 flash drive to attach and detach reliably is by not just DISABLING the conflicting software, but by COMPLETELY UNINSTALLING other more useful software, manufactured by POPULAR AND REPUTABLE cell phone manufacturers (HTC and Samsung). Working with this flash drive is particularly frustrating because of Sandisk's solidly reliable reputation. Because of this nagging issue, users like me are resigned to using cheaper, less reliable products from lesser manufacturers. As a broadcast systems engineering professional who has used Sandisk products for more than 15 years, I am terribly disappointed in Sandisk's ability to discover or create a simple work-around for this product. As such, I am hard pressed to find a Sandisk substitute simply by trial and error. However, I have changed my rating from 1-star to 2-stars because I am sure this product works well within specification for users who do not use conflicting software.Original Review:This drive never ejects properly from any of my Windows 7 64-bit computers. It hangs in the Taskbar, Devices and Printers, and in Control Panel | Device Manager.

Apparently, this is not an uncommon occurence, as there are infinite sites and forums devoted to instructions for same problem: how to unlock a locked flash drive.Starting with a virus scan, then followed all methods, all the way to entering the registry, nothing worked for me- or for most, apparently. Still locked out of the flash drive.Finally I went to the SanDisk site itself.  Apparently, if you wake up one morning to discover all your data on your SanDisk flash is ""Read Only"", you have only one recourse: apply for an RMA from SanDisk, return the garbage and ask for replacement.  Note: you can NOT re-format a write-protected flash drive.  So be wary of returning a drive with data still aboard.I've used lots of flash drives- including at same time and in same way as this SanDisk. None ever had a problem.  Just this one.  Judging by ease of which SanDisk acknowledged the problem, the company is not unaware of it.Judging by net responese, perhaps all flash drives, regardless of make, are susceptible to this collapse.

I can’t speak for the speed because I don’t use it that heavily. The construction does feel a little cheap but not to the point it’s a problem. I did have one issue where I almost corrupted the drive and made it unreadable but I’m nearly 100% certain it was my old computer’s fault, as my computer has a faulty usb driver.

One of the first things a person that tests computer software learns is that all hard drives have an expected lifetime. Whether that lifetime is 100,000 writes, or 1 million writes, or somewhere in between, there is always a lifetime. As a software tester, I often install and remove software up to 32 times in a single day. For most people, that is an extremely high number. I do it because every developer needs to know if the software they work so hard on will work. I have a good record of breaking software I test. I find bugs before the software gets to the everyday user.Along with testing software, I use my computers daily. I have installed the Linux Xubuntu operating system, the Ubuntu operating system, and the Vinux operating system. I do not like installing these often. If I use my hard drives to test with, I must reinstall much more often than I prefer. I found the ideal solution! The SanDisk Cruzer USB Flash Drive in both 8MB and 16MB are perfect for my testing. Using the Linux operating system, it fits on these drives. I am then able to test using a clean installation any program the developers needs tested. Yes, these USB drives are rated for a certain lifetime. However, that lifetime is very high. To have the ability to test as much as I do, without ever losing my own installed operating system and programs is wonderful. To be able to use these Flash Drives in place of a hard drive is great. To be able to effectively close the drives when they are removed from my computers helps keep them protected from physical damage.When I travel, I carry one of these Flash Drives with me with my email program installed. This allows me to use any computer with internet access to check my email and not install anything on the borrowed computer. I also leave no traces behind, since my Flash Drive has all the information on it.I have actually tried many USB Flash Drives. Not all drives are created equal. I have found the SanDisk Cruzer to be of very high quality. Not only do they last for a very long time, they do not break with repeated use. I do not keep these drives plugged in to my computer full time, thus they are plugged in and removed almost daily. They have a slide locking feature that protects the drive plug when not in use. To activate the slide, the user must push down a small tab in the slide. Normally your thumb does it as you slide. If you release the slide, you can push it all the way and it will lock, either open or closed. The case is a little thick, and if you have many devices plugged into the computer, it may not fit. I do not find this any thicker than most of these drives, however. I can highly recommend the SanDisk Cruzer USB Flash Drive for most users.I should say that while my operating system of choice fits nicely on these, Microsoft Windows will not. Windows users can still use them in place of a hard drive, however.

This had some negative reviews as a 360 compatible device, but overall it seemed to work for others.  I gave it a shot and haven't been disappointed.So far I have had no issues using this device for storage and access on the 360.  Saving a whole game to it (~6 GB) did take a while, but not longer than I expected: about 15 minutes.  Subsequently playing the game from this drive was seamless.  Played, saved, etc. without issue.NB: the XBOX will configure the device the first time you plug it in.  As far as I know, 32GB is still the limit for a single device (or single partition on a larger device) that the 360 will work with.  Despite not having any issues configuring the device - and not having any issues since - the lovely folks at MS have decided to include a message stating ""device may not function properly"" (or something like that) when not using their licensed devices.  This is pretty lame and maybe it will come back to haunt me...but so far so good.The product itself feels a little flimsy.  Other, similar devices give a more satisfying *click* when inserted and retracted.  This is pretty minor stuff at the price point, and I'm just leaving it in the 360 all the time anyway.  4.5 stars out of 5.

Everyone and their grandmother makes them and can be found anywhere.  Personally, I've owned a handful ranging from high performance ones (from Corsair with excellent throughput) to generic ones (given to you as swag at conferences).  But of all the ones I've owned, I've also seen them fail (mainly the generic ones).  Nothing is worse than data loss and when relying on a USB drive for presentations/file transfers, you can't have one go bad on you at the wrong time.  With that said, I typically go with brand name USB drives for reliability.For speed and performance, there are specific ones I look to but for everyday file storage, I go with SanDisk.  SanDisk has been making memory cards for years and I've used them more than any other brand in all my devices, such as my phones & Android tablets.  When my dad needed a USB drive to store/transfer some high resolution photos from his DSLR camera, I got him this one.The price per gigabyte is average compared to other manufacturers, but you get the reliability of SanDisk.

Make sure you can see the tip of it where it goes into the computer.  Some big name companies are now making those connectors out of plastic which will drastically reduce their utility.  If it's a cheap drive for a system backup, a class at school, or something disposable then great, but I have some years old ones and the metal is scrapped really bad.  If it were plastic that drive would probably be ruined or have left a plastic residue inside the computer USB ports that's unlikely to be good for it.  So yes, this is metal and that's a very good thing!To start off I don't like sliders.  I like caps.  I put the drives in a carrying case so the cap is irrelevant, unless I want to put it in a pocket or something then no dust gets in.  Still, the feel of this one is impressive and enough to make me look at this closer.  I should note, there are some similar looking SanDisk drives that are sort of more barrel shaped where this is a rectangle.  I really don't like those other ones as the slider is more narrow and sometimes doesn't stick right for me.  This one felt solid and the slider stayed put and didn't make me feel like it'd give out anytime soon.  I'm surprised, but I'm actually happy with this.  The only downside, it's a bit too fat for some USB ports and reminds me of those wide, white, Kingston flash drives.Speed was pretty good and I moved files off a memory card in about 35 minutes, though the slowdown was probably more the memory card than the USB drive.  It is only USB 2.0, but unless you're moving a lot of big files frequently it's not a huge deal.  I've always cared about price and quality more than speed.  Price/Quality/Speed.

Taking all the above into consideration, this Drive still earns Four Stars out of five for its sheer capacity. I bought this drive almost exclusively for musical files, of which I have hundreds. I thought the size of this drive would be perfect for the amount of music I had to store and I was right!

I wanted a reasonable price because for what these things go for at Target or Worst Buy or perhaps even some grocery stores, the brick and mortar tax would have made the transaction not worth doing. But I didn't just want some generic USB keyfob.My point of reference was an old Lexar JumpDrive that I'd had back in the Windows XP days. Its selling point was that it could be configured with a secure, hidden partition. Set that up before any data is loaded and you can balance the public and private partitions to whatever size you want. This SanDisk Cruzer's product description seemed to make this a good replacement for next generation compatibility.After a few days of use this device seems adequate but not ideal. The executable for secured storage is contained on the flash drive. It creates a password-protected ""vault"" on the flash drive. To use the secured storage you run the executable and enter credentials to access the vault. A window appears into which you can drag and drop files and folders. Once the data to be secured has been dropped onto the vault interface, the equivalent of an hourglass appears. The duration of this hourglass depends on how much data is to be copied or moved to the flash drive. I tried this on a couple different computers as well as attempting to copy data from a NAS device. A few hundred MB took anywhere from one to three minutes.There was one exception though. One folder coming from the NAS device took so much longer than I would have expected that after an hour or an hour and a half I stopped the transfer. I'm thinking that may be due to the NAS device, though I can't say for sure. But the next day I opened the vault on a different computer. Because I'd stopped the transfer the day before I wanted to see what had and had not copied over. Transfer from the flash drive to another PC took so long that again I just stopped it because I had things to do. This brings up the biggest gotcha for the SanDisk Cruzer:You cannot access your secured data while it is in the vault.To write to files in the vault, you have to copy the file(s) or folder(s) over to the PC to which the keyfob is attached. Now, I'm not working with national security or anything, but the folder containing financials is something I want to keep secure. Having to copy data from the vault to the host PC puts that information on the system's hard drive, which is counter to the logic of data security in the first place. At that point your formerly secure data is retrievable by common forensics tools until you run a professional disk wiping utility. Oh, the instructions say that you can move the data to the public partition of this USB drive, but it still begs the question, why should you have to go through this dance of data back and forth?Here's a second drawback: the vault is not discreet.The value of a USB storage device like this is that it's large enough to contain all of your critical records. A few years ago fires raged throughout the county and evacuees were lining the streets. With an emergency situation you want to be able to grab your critical data and go. Because you're mobile, you need data security in case the flash drive falls out of your pocket or otherwise gets lost. Let's say somebody finds your flash drive. Once you've created the vault, it is clearly evident as a ""Vault"" folder on the device. That folder can be browsed, though contents are obscured through encryption. The Lexar method, in contrast, was more refined. Although the Lexar executable resided on the USB device, there was no other evidence of the keyfob being partitioned or having a secured partition. Conceivably someone could find that Lexar device, wipe it clean by opening it in Windows Explorer and deleting its contents, and never know there was still a secured hidden partition.Consider this 32 GB SanDisk Cruzer to be a small data warehouse. Get this if you just need a secured second copy of critical data but you don't intend to work with it. The SanDisk Cruzer might be a decent choice for an emergency preparedness kit.","More like a data warehouse, less like a portable hard drive",Capacity: 32 GBPackage Type: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

The USB slider is a gimmick and a hindrance. You don't need it. It serves no purpose and does not protect your flash drives. If you want to protect it from water damage or being bent, get a flash drive with a cap instead. That slider will not only fail to protect against water damage but also increase the likelihood of bending the connector and circuitry.The slider mechanism is easy to accidentally push especially when trying to plug it in the computer or device. I often accidentally push the release button. I know this is easily avoided but it is bound to happen. Sometimes when plugging these into the computer, they wouldn't go in because I'd accidentally pressed the button and cause the USB to retract into the shell.If you are a fan of a SanDisk product go buy the ones without buttons. They are smaller and are just as prone to damage as the Cruzer flash drives. You won't have to deal with it.There is one last thing I need to point out. I've had previous generations of SanDisk Cruzer's and they all had this slider to retract and expose the USB. The older Cruzer's did not accidentally pop out because the buttons were a little stiffer to press.Another issue I have with this flash drive is that it is a little big bulky in comparison to the older Cruzers. It's unlikely that you can stick in two of these side by side or plug it in next to another USB device.So how can SanDisk improve the next generation of the Cruzer? The first thing the company needs to do is design a smaller case. The next thing they need to do is reposition the slider to be closer to the butt of the device and further from the head where the USB is. This prevents the thumb from pressing the button when the user is plugging in the device.On the other hand, these flash drives are fast when moving files (about 30-35 mega bytes per second). They are reliable, as I haven't lost any data in any way.

This SanDisk does not have an ""Eject"" or ""Safely Remove"" feature.  Some USB drives will automatically close out when the USB drive is removed, but this one does not.  I can drag/drop data onto the drive but when I pull it out, the data does not save.  It seems to work if I shut down my computer and then pull out the USB drive.

My least favorite thing about this Flash drive is that there is no lanyard or string to attach to the tiny hole on the flash drive, had there have been a lanyard provided it would have been much easier to carry around (it's hard to find a string as small as this hole, not including sewing thread). It's not a huge deal, its just bothersome and I'm sure others fell the same way! Now my FAVORITE thing about this flash drive is that it is password protected, so if you were to misplace the drive and someone was to find it, they could not access the files without the set password (+++ to Sandisk for this feature)!

This was a waist of money.EditedI was able to use the flash drive by using the below key strokes to use the Windows Recovery Drive instead of the Toshiba Wizard preinstalled on my laptop.  We will see if it holds up.To begin with, you need to know that the USB flash drive you choose to use will become a dedicated Recovery Drive - you won't be able to use it for anything else. In its base configuration, the contents of the Recovery Drive will require about 256MB of space. However, if you choose to include the OEM recovery partition, you'll need more space. Thus, if you are creating a basic Recovery Drive, you can use a 1GB USB flash drive. (If you have a smaller sized drive, from the old days, you could use it as well.) If you are going to add OEM recovery partition, you'll want at least a 16GB USB flash drive.To launch the USB flash drive version of the Recovery tool, use the [Windows] + W keystroke to access the Search Settings page, type Recovery Drive in the text box, and click Create a recovery drive, as illustrated in Figure A. You'll then encounter a UAC, as shown in Figure B and will need to click Yes to continue.

So Xbox warns you that you should only use their official products because the performance of ""other"" products might not be up to Xbox standards. When I first installed this on my system I received a warning stating that this was not up to snuff and that I might experience performance issues. All I can say is that I loaded Skyrim onto it and it's been working fine for about a month. I particularly like the red led on the casing that flashes when the system is reading/writing. Anyone who has played Skyrim to higher levels knows that the loading time for screens can sometimes seem interminable and the light informs me that the system is still working (Skyrim has a tendency to lock up occaisionally).",Seems to work for Xbox 360,Capacity: 16 GBPackage Type: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

This portable device is more reliable and safer than other memory storage devices. To keep your files save, with this device you can back-up your data to prevent losing it on a computer.Different ModelsThe USB flash drive, is a data storage device that comes in different models and memory capacities.

If you are a person who is constantly writing documents, or storing great amounts of data, a good recommendation would be to invest in a USB flash drive with higher memory capacity. Keep in mind that the higher the memory capacity, the more expensive the device would be. For example, a SanDisk 128GB USB 2.0 Flash drive costs $27.99 from Amazon, which is still very affordable and you get 5 years of warranty. If you are looking for a USB flash drive just to store online documents, photos, or any personal information a SanDisk 16GB 2.0 Flash Drive would be recommended.

If you like to be organized with your documents, the device provides you with the options to organize your files by date, or even create folders.
