For my personal pc I bought an internal NZXT usb hub so it's out of sight and mind for a cleaner look for my wireless keyboard/mouse but i like using this for others that I build computers for as they don't want to have to open the case and would have no idea how to even unattach something from a board.  This little device is perfect for slapping a piece of velcro on the back and just plugging it into one of the USB 3.0+ ports available on the back of your PC thus changing it into a 2.0 and allowing you to plug in those little wireless adapaters for your keyboard, mouse etc.  So if you're frustrated from your wireless keyboard/mouse seemingly not working correctly, do yourself a favor and pick up one of these (it HAS to be the USB 2.0...they do make an identical looking 3.0) some velcro tape and just slap this puppy on the back of your pc out of sight and problem SOLVED.

I do a LOT of work with them and figured the on off switch and the USB lighting would be a benefit, and THEY are. The problem? You can only use two and sometimes 3 of the ports at a time due to them being too close together and pen drives being wider than USB cord ends! If they had given a quarter inch more between ports then ALL would work, and I would be happy. But, alas... I will use it until it fails which I suspect will be quite a while as it seems to be durable. It would have benefited with say a 24-30"" cord instead of the 10"".

I will update this review if I notice anything in the future. Price is unbelievably low vs. quality for value. I had another component from Sabrent a few years ago and was very impressed with the quality for the very low price and this motivated me to buy their components again this time. This hub component is listed on the official Sabrent site at $13. plus shipping. Product arrived in a retail presentation package and the carton was secured with seals suggesting that it was probably not a used return. The only other feature to speak about are the on/off buttons. The 4 buttons can be used as 1 or all 4 or any combination of on/off 1 thru 4 and that is convenient. Only thing I can point out that does not show up easily in advertisement is that the hub is about the size of a  large pack of 10 stick chewing gum and is lighter in weight than expected so, the lightness of the hub weight will not necessarily allow it to stay lying flat on desk or table without cords flipping it over while using. However, the plugs stay in securely and it will remain connected. One must be alert and observe that moving one of the wires does not cause this hub to turn over and, then,  may press against one of the 4 buttons and turn off whatever one is charging. I combined this hub with the "" Sabrent 22AWG USB 2.0 extension cord 6 feet (CB-2060) "". This is available from same Amazon seller as hub. Extension cord allows hub to be behind computer and moves the clutter and chaos of wires out of the way.

This is great because you never have to disconnect the usb cords in order to ensure there's no power drainage!Speaking of power, some USB devices require an external power source because the USB power output is insufficient to power the device. The makers of this device designed it so that you can plug a charger into the back of it and provide extra power to all 4 USB ports if necessary! But wait, it gets better! You can even use this as a power splitter to charge 4 devices SIMULTANEOUSLY with just one charger plugged into the back! Genius!But wait, it gets even better! You can actually support up to 127 USB devices by piggy backing multiple USB hubs off of each other! I have no idea why anyone would need to do that, but if you do you can!

This USB hub made switching between devices a dream. All it took was a press of a button. The buttons are nice and have two distinct height levels to indicate whether they're on or off. They also have lights, but if you're using multiple ports, there tends to be a little bit of bleed from one button to the other. This doesn't really affect how it works, though. When I'd turn on the port for the headset, my PC recognized the device immediately and the drivers loaded right up. No fiddling with wires and USB superposition with a device like this. There are other hubs similar to this that also have buttons, but those aren't nearly as cheap as this one. The best part is, it's still going. The hub still lives after 4 years of near constant use.

The hub was fantastic for about the first 3 months, up until two of the USB lights stopped working, while the USB connectors still worked. No big deal, just a minor annoyance. After another month or so, the cable stopped working, killing the rest of the USB ports. The product became pretty useless after 4 or so months and I could not have it returned or replaced.As for when the actual product came in, it felt rather flimsy and cheap from the get-go. The cable was a tangled mess and never got untangled over time, which may have contributed to it breaking down on me. The LED lights were very bright, which was a minor annoyance in night when I left my computer on, but I just covered it up. The plastic wasn't super durable, but unless you plan on throwing this around or sitting on it, it should be good enough. The USB ports were slightly wobbly, but nothing fell out so that was solid for me.The functionality of the HUB was standard: USB go in, USB work. One thing that didn't seem to work was my keyboard - a Cooler Master Quickfire Pro keyboard - which was half the reason why I purchased the HUB in the first place. Extreme letdown, but I plugged it into my computer's other USB port and moved on. The hub also charges incredibly slowly, so if you are here to purchase a hub that can also charge your electronics, this is likely not for you. My phone charged approximately 15% in about an hour.It was obvious that the USB hub wasn't going to last in the long run, but it served its purpose for the cheap price of $7 that I purchased it for.

I can safely say that, while this is a highly effective 4-port USB charger, it fails in every respect as a camera.Looking at Amazon's feature list, the first thing it wants me rating is camera quality. I'm afraid I have to give this only a single star. If I could, I would give it even less. Forget megapixels, I was unable to use this alleged camera to get even a SINGLE pixel onscreen. I really have to question the decision-making of the manufacturer, seeing as they decided to forgo camera quality in favor of accessory features, like four LED USB ports which light up when charging, and thus allow me to easily manage power output to multiple devices.I must give it a 1 in charge power as well. While it has proven itself exceedingly useful when it comes to charging OTHER devices, such as my tablet PC, Phone, XBox One controller, and wireless mouse, it does not keep a charge for even a single second. Had I been expected to rate its capabilities at charging other objects, I would of course have given it a five star, the blue LED lights take minimal power and allow me to choose between putting almost all of the charge power into my charging device when I go out for a walk, or having several devices plugged in at a time.My laptop's USB ports are largely broken, and there's only one of them. This USB hub allows me to plug in an extra keyboard and mouse, because the shoddy quality of the Alienware keyboard the laptop came with meant that its keys have largely fallen off. I have had no choice but to find a USB hub, such as this one, when it comes to charging. I've used several brands of USB hub, and this is absolutely the best one I can find.I have, thus, given it TWO stars for cable length. Its cable is actually slightly larger than normal for USB hubs, meaning I don't need to worry as much about bumping it when I move my hands around the desk. It's really quite generous in that respect. However, even long for a USB hub is very short for a camera, which somehow the algorithm believes this is. As a camera, the charge cable is far too small. Once again, however, you need not worry, because it won't actually keep its charge anyway.I'm sorry to say that I am cannot in good conscience approve of the camera I was provided. However, since the page I bought it was labeled a USB extender port, and it is 100% the best one of those I have ever seen, sturdier than most, sticking effectively in the port on my laptop that most other things jiggle out of, that's not really that much of a disappointment.If you are looking for a digital camera, look elsewhere. This is not a digital camera. However, if you want a USB port, I cannot possibly recommend it highly enough. This is a miracle, and if it ever breaks just from overuse from how much I am carrying it around and such, I fully intend to replace it with another of the same brand. You can't get a better 4-port USB port, a fact which, I hope, will somewhat soften the blow to anyone who expected a camera.Five stars to the product, and one star to whatever idiot made Amazon's product recognition algorithms.","Worst Camera Ever, But Has Other Uses",Verified Purchase,,,20,15,1954792,Public

That's far to short to be of much use unless you run wireless USB devices which I fortunately do. Otherwise, you're hosed. This just screams the company is to cheap to make a 2 foot or 3 foot USB cord which might cost them another 80 cents worth of wiring and coating. Minus one star for the absurdly short USB cord.

The one or two times it has disconnected or improperly ejected my drive was when I either plugged or unplugged something else into the 4-Port Hub (I believe it was during a transfer, so it seems that the connection was disrupted from the additional source added or being taken away), or when I turned pressed or depressed one of the buttons to cut power to that USB port.Because I cited either of these activities as disrupting the connection to my external drive, I just do not mess with the on/off port buttons or plug/unplug anything during a transfer just as a precaution. (Note: the drive does not disconnect every single time that things are plugged/unplugged or the button for a port is pushed, I can usually use it like normal even when my external is connected.

Now, its just a simple matter of turning the port on or off as needed.My only complaint is the input cord is way too short.  I already owned a 6 foot USB extension so it was not a big deal.  But the cord that it comes with is even too short to plug it into a port and attach the hub to the top of the tower using a Velcro strip.  Improving this device with even a 3 foot cord would be an improvement.",Perfect for my needs!,Verified Purchase,,,483,85,48374,Public

As part of our privacy policy, I have to use headphones for these, since private customer information may be discussed.Previously, I used the ports on the aluminum full sized keyboard that came with my Mac. Since that keyboard finally died, I replaced it with another one that did not include the two USB ports. I was a little annoyed at first, since trying to fumble to plug the headphones in for meetings behind the mac was somewhat difficult. Additionally, needing to plug and unplug my iOS devices to accommodate this left me unimpressed, as well as having to sometimes juggle my USB stick when I needed headphones, and the iPod.This wasn't much of an issue when I could plug in to the keyboard, but behind the mac was just a pain.This USB hub was the PERFECT answer. In addition to giving me plenty of extra USB ports, the switching feature means I can leave my headset plugged in full time. I just press the button to have it go live for meetings, then go back to internal mic/speakers by turning off the port. Super Simple!

The replacement USB hub works just fine.  Thanks very much Andrew!  Also, to clarify, attached to the older (failed) unit was in the simplest scenario of just one device - a PNY USB flash thumb drive which draws very little current - and even with just that one device the drive would erratically attach and detach constantly (while it was plugged in) which made it basically impossible to access the thumb drive in any reliable way.  This doesn't happen with the new hub - it maintains the connection (so far).So I have to say that I'm very impressed with Sabrent's proactive support.  It's unusual, and speaks highly of them.

I didn't plug the power supply into my power strip - the hub will drive flash drives, but won't supply enough power to handle a disk drive.  It easily handled two HDDs when I plugged in the power supply.  Duh.2.

It is fast as well, takes about 7 seconds for windows to recognize the device once you hit the power button. Which by the way is a really nice feature.

Since current Macbooks only have two USB ports, I depend on self-bussing hubs to handle 2-3 2 TB external hard drives for storage and backup of professional film files, card readers and the external connector for my mouse.  Often these hubs don't provide good response for external hard drives and card readers, but this one is excellent.  The connectivity is great, and my backups go through seamlessly.  I have a complicated Broadcast card reader that requires one USB connector for power and another one for data transmission.  I am able to plug the power cord directly into a USB port on the Macbook and the data one works fine through the hub. This hub has been a lifesaver and gotten rid of a lot of frustration in connectivity and functionality.  Another great feature is the ability to easily turn the individual ports on the hub on and off with the push of a button.  A clear blue light indicates whether the hub is on or off.  This cuts off wasted power flow to any hubs that are not being used and saves the power for the hubs that are in operation.  Excellent!  I usually use 2-3 of the 4 ports and it's just great to be able to direct power by turning the other ones off!  I also run up and down stairs with my computer a couple of times a day to go from film studio to living room to home office, and the hub has strong connections and a well-build but light design that easily travels with me without disconnecting my portable hard drives.

The leds on top let you know which port is on and which is off.  No more powering down things to unplug them, just click the button on top.  Brilliant design.What you don't know about hubs:Hubs used to be used in networks as the main connection point for computers to talk to one another.  Some people probably still use them at times.  This is fine until you get too many computers talking to each other.  A hub is stupid.  It will send communication it receives to every port attached - even if the port doesn't need it.  For networks, this is terrible because so much little talk is being transmitted and received across different computers.  It will slow down immensely.A USB 2.0 hub is no different.  It's sending the data to every port.  With this having the ability to turn off the ports not being used, it speeds up the communication.  I like that I can keep some things plugged in and just turn them off when they are not needed.  The speed does go up, but it's also handy not seeing those things pop up in my computer window when I'm working.Yes, I recommend this hub - it looks great and works great","Looks great, works great.

I was desperate for something like this - my laptop only has 3 USB ports, and 2 are permanently spoken for. There are times when I needed to have more USB ports because of my devices that need to be connected via USB to my laptop. This works great. Just plug into laptop USB and plug into it whatever you need. And you don't have to keep connecting and disconnecting - you can turn the USB off with the switch (LED light indicates on/off). And if you need more than a 4 port, you can get another 4 port and connect it to this one (according to the package). When you have everything turned off, you don't need to eject USB on the laptop because it only reads what is turned on.I highly recommend this product.**UPDATE 9/15/2014**I ordered another one because with all the products I'm getting that require a USB port (wired keyboard, USB LED light, etc), I just needed another. Took it right out of the packaging, plugged it in....and it works. It works connected to the laptop directly, and it also works connected to another 4-port Hub that's connected to the laptop.I know some people will wonder why I bothered getting a wired keyboard that would require a USB port (because my laptop key pads are acting up, and I don't want to worry about battery life with a wireless), but all in all, I'm happy with my first and second Sabrent 4-Port USB Hub.Fast delivery, and I've had no problems with it.

If you unplug and the drive wasnt ready, youre safer to plug the same item back in; the danger is to plug a different directory into that same port, and then from RAM it writes the former directory onto the new different drive. Computers have only so much memory for directories, and once they max, they will drop a drive from your hub to load the next drive up of your hub. I learned this with a ten port USB hub. This maxing the directory memory of your computer will crash one directory to load up the next directory. And in my case twice i lost a WD Passport Tera drive permanantly because of too much directory Gigs. (Yes, i did swap a drive, and it tried to claim the new drive was the former one plugged in.) So the push-button off is a must for safely having four Tera drives connected. The off-on buttons is a must for USB hubs. WAIT until you hear the computer beep of USB connect or USB drop.

I have been using my laptop exclusively recently after the failure of my desktop machine, and it has a severe lack of USB ports, which is why I ordered this product.  Most of the devices I plug into the laptop are storage drives, and every time I moved my laptop slightly or wiggled the USB hub, the drives would disconnect and reconnect, causing all kinds of warning messages to flash on my screen about improper removal.  Thankfully this never happened in the middle of a write operation.  The hub worked fine for other devices, however, such as my corded mouse.  The only other drawback to this product that I can think of is that it is unpowered, so the external drives that lack an individual power source (eg. WD ""My Passport"" drives) will not work with it.  On the plus side, it is very small and portable, making it a great laptop companion if only it weren't for the loose connection issue...Overall, if you're on the fence I would take a pass on this product, go with a slightly more expensive USB hub that won't cause you any problems and I'm sure it'll be worth it in the long run.

While I was hesitating over whether to contact the seller, since I couldn't be sure whether I broke the port when I pushed my USB drive in or if I received a defective product, the seller reached out to me for feedback. I wrote back explaining that one of the ports were broken, but that it could have been my own fault. The seller immediately sent me a replacement and told me I could keep the defective hub as well. I couldn't be more satisfied with their customer service. This was a situation where it's possible--maybe even probable--that it was not their fault (I spent quite some time pondering the likelihood of a bent tooth in the port being a manufacturing error...), and without hesitation they sent me a replacement. They were customer-oriented and responsive.So far I've had zero issues with the hub aside from their being a bit tight for my Logitech usb drive (other drives less so).

Also useful for powering on/off USB accessories that don't have a switch of their own (speakers, etc.). GREAT for low-speed, low-power accessories and for providing just that little extra bit of standoff for flash drives.If they came with some hook-loop tape or some other adhesive, they'd be a perfect 5.",Handy hub,Verified Purchase,,,,,9396242,

My laptop is getting old (so a lot of problems), but one of the first was that my USB 3.0 ports broke very early on in the lifespan. This left me with one port for all my USB connections, which just wasn't enough after a while. Got this little guy, and it's mostly solved my problems. Really nice that you can also just press the little LED buttons to turn the connection on/off rather than unplugging. I have my mouse, a mic, and a cooler connected at once and so far haven't had too many problems. It does feel as though the hub cannot support the full power for the cooler sometimes, but that's to be expected. Sometimes, my mouse cursor will stop moving though the mouse is on, but I haven't checked to see if that's the port's issue or the mouse issue.

This adapter plugs into one port and gives your 4 ports, for a net gain of 3 USB ports. Good to have.It works, but it feels kind of flimsy. Also, somehow the computer detects that a device has been added when the cable touches the port on the hub, even if the port is turned off.
