Professor Nishanth,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJRVL6ZCBVHSJM4M4J6S7LXFEPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019",5,,https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/product-reviews/B07FKR6KXF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Original review (June 9, 2019) and three updates placed at the end of the original review (June 10, 2019, June 14, 2019, and June 21, 2019, respectively).ORIGINAL REVIEW: June 9, 2019 (5/5 stars)UPDATED REVIEW: June 21, 2019 (4/5 stars)For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).This device is Amazon’s most recently refreshed (2019 – 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.Below is my summary of the “Fire 7.” I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.-THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.- AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.- Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model:--- Display size remains the same--- PPI remains the same at 171--- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM.--- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone)--- Size specifications remain the same--- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)- Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017.---  Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB).--- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version.--- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging.--- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available.--- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version.--- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams)--- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page).--- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.- Technical specs and other details:--- Size: 7.6” x 4.5” x 0.4” (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm).--- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles.--- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback--- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB--- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases.--- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams--- Amazon’s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for “Mashed Potatoes” and it will do so.--- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7)--- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera--- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor--- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life--- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used)--- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication.  No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks.--- Bluetooth 4.1 LE--- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker.- Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series):--- No HD video viewing available--- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out)--- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker)--- Sound quality is average--- Amazon’s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store.--- Amazon’s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.).--- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced).--- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.-Fire 7: 2019 Tablet Kids edition: Please note that Amazon has updated their Fire 7 Kids Edition too. Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)--- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 (2017 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8)--- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera)--- Weight: Fire HD 10 (17.7 oz, 500 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 [32 GB (25.4 GB available to user) or 64 GB (54.1 GB available to user)] vs. Fire 7 [(internal storage remains same - 16 GB (9.4 GB available to user) or 32 GB (23.6 GB available to user)]--- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).- Some useful features on Fire Tablets (not a comprehensive list)--- Accessibility: “VoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.”--- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk--- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music.--- Ability to read Kindle books.--- Ability to read the news using Washington Times--- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.--- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc.--- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.- Testing:Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.- Saving money on purchasing the Fire:--- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card.--- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet.--- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers..--- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire.--- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item.--- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.-Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).- Conclusion:To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store.  Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.- UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).- UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period)--- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish!--- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.”--- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends).*FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019):  Battery Life and SoftwareSome customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven’t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section.

I have other sized Fire tablets (8 Inch) and a new ipad, plus the new Kindle paper white, but the Fire 7 is my go to tablet. What I use it for. Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube.  Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.  This is a snappy little tablet and my favorite size.  It feels good in the hand with the solid plastic build (compared to the Fire 8 inch, which feels more ""cheap""). It is a great tablet to use while lying in bed, which is mainly when I use it (ipad 9.7 is to heavy). I feel that Amazon finally got it right with this new 2019 version. The previous versions are painfully slow to load anything, and that is why I never would recommend them especially for a child.  These new tablets are so much better, my wife wants one, and I will be buying them for my kids, something I would not even consider before, because of the frustration of the slowness (and the reason my kids took over the ipad and iphones in the first place).  As you can see this is a consumption device, meant for fun..not a computer or workhorse.  I should mention you can check email and use the tablet for video chatting and dropping in on other echo devices which works really well and my kids have fun using it, I should also mention that I am a Prime member and take advantage of the Prime photo storage, which any picture that I take on my iphone, pops up on my Fire Tablet. I should also mention why I use this for reading more than my paper white, it is because I like the ""page curl effect"" and the way it highlights my passages on books (I still use my paper white..but this is just a preference). The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 2mp camera (which I do not use much) and the battery life, which is actually not bad, but Amazon asked for a ""star"" rating on those two features as well as tablet as a whole.  At $50 you can not go wrong. Plus if you have a previous version, just trade it in. I got $10 knocked off and an additional 20% savings. I think I paid about $33.  I will be trading in my 8 inch Fire for this size as well.  Great little tablet!",I can finally recommend the Fire 7,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,"3,053 people found this helpful",,3076,10,12454,Public

I didn't realize it didn't include Google play games. Unfortunately that was my reason for getting a tablet, so I will be returning mine and getting something with Google play services.

Battery life is TERRIBLE2. Screen Freezes3. screen unresponsive4. drops wifi connection5. Bluetooth turns on and off all by its little self6. Very slow browsing or maybe that is the screen freezing7. Crashes 80% of the time this thing is so slow and unresponsive that I am so happy when I can finally open a book to read and then....crash8. Alexa doesn't hear me half the time or she is purposelly trying to annoy the hell out of me  (b*tch)I have always been extremely happy with amazon kindles, be it an e-reader or fire tablet. I have owned and do own several there were some I had to exchange but in the end everything worked out and I was a happy kindle owner.This kindle I am extremely disappointed with. Because I love the size, the weight, the color options and being able to switch from reading to surfing and not being cumbersome like the fire 10.I will be exchanging mine and hope I don't get one of the other unsatisfied customers refurbished piece of crap.Update...received my replacement kindle so far so good but..the other one worked good for about a week. Will post further updates.I do have to say that customer service was awesome. My exchange was not a problem. Thanks for that amazon and keeping fingers crossed on my replacement.Final update... may 30 2020, the only thing i use this for is audiobooks. Would not recommend this to anyone.",This is such an EPIC fail....,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,736 people found this helpful,,1298,80,19686,Public

Each time when I am setting it up, and ask myself why I bought another one. I will not be purchasing another amazon tablet again, and here is why.There are some PROS to this tablet. They are cheap so I can buy one for all my kids to use / The battery life is really good / They are good enough hardware wise to run pretty much whatever kids games my kids download / That's where the pros end.CONS - The cons of this device far out weigh the pros. This tablet displays enough ads to choke a horse / The tablet is very slow. every few months I have to factory reset it when it is slows to a crawl without any indication as to why / Storage is low at 16GB. I added a 64GB sd card to each tablet. however this does not solve the issue, because in order for the SD card to be effective, the app has to be SD card compatible which only 10% of them are. So most apps will remain on the tablet with no way to transfer them to the SD card  / The home screen is full of garbage, and useless apps and features that my kids will never use, and just ends up confusing them. There is no way to clean the home screen up. My kids won't use GoodReads, or exclusive offers, or Shopping, or New Stand, or any of the other 45 home screens chalk full of crap. It would be nice if I could disable those home screens and just have ONE main home screen with their apps on it. If I want to buy them a book, or if they are dying to read the latest editions on new stand, then that should be inside the amazon app, not plastered on the home screen.  My kids also don't use email, so I went in to uninstall that, you can't. to free up resources and storage, I wanted to uninstall email, weather, amazon deals, good reads, audible, New Stand, Maps, Offers, Shop Amazon, and several other apps, but you can't they are locked down.I figured there has to be a way to remove the ads, well there is. Pay amazon 15.00 to enroll in the service to remove the ads from the device. WOW is all I can say.  After being a Prime member for over 6 years, I am really starting to reach that ""Enough is enough"" point.The bottom line is, spend the extra 50.00 and buy a real tablet. It will save you a lot of money in the long run because your child won't go to the ""SHOP"" home screen and order you a bunch of stuff on your behalf when you see 3 delivery trucks roll up outside your window, 14 new newsstand subscriptions in the mail, a 6 year audible membership, and 145 amazon prime movie purchases, all thanks to the quick and easy home screen layout.",Waste of Money,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,285 people found this helpful,,555,236,116042,Public

I don’t like bright artificial blue light glaring in my eyes (not good for brain health), so it’s totally awesome Amazon put this in the new Kindle.I got this strictly as an eReader because I wanted something more book-sized than my iPhone XS Max pictured to the left of the Kindle. My Kindle 2nd Gen Paperwhite was too slow for page-turn and browsing the Kindle store. I won’t be downloading other apps or using this as a tablet. I have an iPad for tablet use.

I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).This device is Amazon’s most recently refreshed (2019 – 9th generation) Fire tablet 7 inch at an outstanding price. The Fire 7 (9th generation) is definitely slightly better than the previous generation. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the tablet does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Fire and my final recommendations.Below is my summary of the “Fire 7.” I have spent the past few days playing around with the Fire, using it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Fire model was last refreshed in 2017. This review has overlaps with my review of the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet because both of these are essentially the same tablet but to a different audience.-THE BOX: The Fire 7 tablet, a quick-start guide, basic safety instructions, 5W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 3 foot or 36 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.- AVAILABILITY: Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage are the base colors variants. Additionally, covers can be purchased for $29.99 in the same color scheme as the Fire tablet from Amazon. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other high quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.- Key things that have not changed from the prior Fire 7 model:--- Display size remains the same--- PPI remains the same at 171--- RAM remains the same at 1 GB of RAM.--- Speaker and microphone remains the same (mono speaker with built-in microphone)--- Size specifications remain the same--- Warranty remains the same (90-day limited warranty)- Summary of key aspects (listed in order of importance) that have changed in this version (Fire 7: 2019: 9th generation) from prior generation Fire 7 tablet (2017: 7th generation). For the below comparison, the new version will be listed as Fire 2019 and the previous model as Fire 2017.---  Fire 2019: Increased storage options (16 GB or 32 GB) as compared to prior version Fire 2017 (8 GB or 16 GB).--- Battery life has declined to 7 hours (1-hour reduction) from prior version.--- Charge time has decreased from 6 hours (Fire 2017) to 4 hours (Fire 2019). This is a major plus because it would take forever to charge these tablets). Again, please note that this claim (regarding charging time) holds true only if an Amazon wall outlet is used. The tablet usually notifies you when you are using a non-compatible wall outlet and cable. I have tested charging speeds on third-party wall ports and noticed a substantial increase in charging time as compared to using an Amazon wall outlet. So, ideally, consumers should use only the Amazon wall outlet for fast charging.--- The new processor based on specs provided by Amazon to developers Fire 7 2019 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 (1.3 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 2017 [Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A7 (1.3 GHz)] is a bit faster. Again, this is my initial assessment. This would require additional testing and I will put in these numbers at a later time when they become available.--- Camera quality has improved 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording as compared to the prior version.--- Slight decrease in weight (0.3 oz/9 grams)--- Light sensor added (mentioned in developer information page).--- Three new colors added (Twilight Blue, Plum, and Sage) in addition to Black.- Technical specs and other details:--- Size: 7.6” x 4.5” x 0.4” (192 x 115 x 9.6 mm).--- 171 pixel per inch (PPI) with IPS display technology and advanced polarizing filter. This basically means that there is a bright display with vivid colors and whiter whites for a great viewing experience from all angles.--- 7-inch screen, 1024 x 600 resolution with SD video playback--- Internal Storage: 16 or 32 GB--- External Storage: expandable storage using MicroSD card for up to 512 GB + unlimited cloud storage for Amazon digital content purchases.--- Weight: 10.1 oz/286 grams--- Amazon’s digital assistant: Hands-free Alexa enabled. This option basically converts the device into a stand-alone device that can do multiple functions. For instance, if you are cooking and want help, you can ask Alexa to pull up the instructions for “Mashed Potatoes” and it will do so.--- Warranty and Service: 90-day limited warranty and service included. U.S. customers can purchase an extended warranty for 1, 2 or 3 years (though I might not personally recommend this for such an affordable product like the Fire 7)--- Camera: 2MP VGA front-facing camera and rear-facing HD camera--- Sensors: Accelerometer and light sensor--- Battery life: Up to 7 hours of battery life--- Fully charges in 4 hours (if Amazon wall outlet is used)--- Single-antenna dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security using password authentication.  No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks.--- Bluetooth 4.1 LE--- Ports: USB 2.0 (micro-B connector) to connect to the computer or for charging the device with the included power adapter; MicroSDXC slot for external storage, and 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker.- Some limitations (to be expected because of this tablet being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Fire series):--- No HD video viewing available--- Camera specs are sub-par as compared to other costlier tablets (again this might sound oxymoronic...but just pointing it out)--- Max volume is below average (because of the mono-speaker)--- Sound quality is average--- Amazon’s ecosystem is not as massive compared to the Google Play Store and Apple Play Store.--- Amazon’s Silk browser is not as intuitive and user-friendly as more prominent competitors (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.).--- Some reviewers have claimed that the external storage (MicroSDXC card) is not as responsive as the internal storage (this is not something I have experienced).--- Because of concerns dealing with volume and sound quality using this model for listening to music, or watching TV shows, movies, etc. might require headphones or a speaker.-Fire 7: 2019 Tablet Kids edition: Please note that Amazon has updated their Fire 7 Kids Edition too. Since, this is for a different audience, I will not deal with it in this review.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 8 (2018 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 8 (6 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 8 (8 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 8 (HD video playback) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 8 (1280 * 800; 189 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- RAM: Fire HD 8 (1.5 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 8 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 8 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Weight: Fire HD 8 (12.8 oz, 363 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Expandable Storage (internal storage remains same): Fire HD 8 (expandable by to 400 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 8 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red, Canary Yellow) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 8 (16 GB - $79.99; 32 GB - $109.99) vs. Fire HD 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 8 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)--- Processors, software version, and cameras remain the same on both units.- Comparison between Fire 7 (this version – 2019 release) and Fire HD 10 (2017 release – mid-tier model):--- Charge time: Fire HD 10 (5 hours) vs. Fire 7 (4 hours)--- Display Size: Fire HD 10 (10.1 inches) vs. Fire 7 (7 inches)--- Video playback: Fire HD 10 (HD video playback; 1080p HD resolution) vs. Fire 7 (SD video playback)--- Resolution: Fire HD 10 (1920 * 1200; 224 PPI) vs. Fire 7 (1024 *600; 171 PPI)--- Processor: Fire HD 10 [2xARM Cortex-A72 (1.8 GHz), 2xARM Cortex-A53 (1.4 GHz)] vs. Fire 7 inch (ARM Cortex-A53 Quad-Core 1.3 GHz) (basically Fire HD 10 would be substantially faster than either the Fire 7 or Fire HD 8)--- RAM: Fire HD 10 (2 GB RAM) vs. Fire 7 (1 GB RAM)--- Battery life: Fire HD 10 (10 hours) vs. Fire 7 (7 hours),--- Speaker: Fire HD 10 (Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers) vs. Fire 7 (Mono speaker)--- Camera: Fire HD 10 (0.3 MP front-facing and 2 MP rear-facing camera) vs. Fire 7 (2 MP front-facing and rear-facing camera)--- Weight: Fire HD 10 (17.7 oz, 500 g) vs. Fire 7 (10.1 oz, 286 g)--- Internal Storage: Fire HD 10 [32 GB (25.4 GB available to user) or 64 GB (54.1 GB available to user)] vs. Fire 7 [(internal storage remains same - 16 GB (9.4 GB available to user) or 32 GB (23.6 GB available to user)]--- Expandable Storage: Fire HD 10 (expandable by to 256 GB) vs. Fire 7 (expandable by up to 512 GB).--- Colors: Fire HD 10 (Black, Marine Blue, Punch Red) vs.. Fire 7 (Black, Twilight Blue, Plum, Sage)--- Cost: Fire HD 10 (32 GB - $149.99; 32 GB - $189.99) vs. Fire 7 (16 GB - $49.99; 32 GB - $69.99)--- Multi-touch: Fire HD 10 (10-point) vs. Fire 7 (5-point)** If you are considering buying the Fire HD 10, I would wait on it as there is a high probability that this model will be refreshed this year as the last update was in 2017 (Amazon seems to follow a 2-year refresh cycle though this is not always the case).- Some useful features on Fire Tablets (not a comprehensive list)--- Accessibility: “VoiceView and Screen Magnifier enable access to the vast majority of Fire tablet features. VoiceView features text-to-speech voice. Fire OS 5 also includes system wide closed caption settings, adjustable font sizes up to 50% larger, and a variety of book reading text adjustments such as adjustable colors and text spacing. Also includes adjustable font sizes/color, and built-in Oxford dictionary.”--- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk--- Watching movies, TV shows and listening to music.--- Ability to read Kindle books.--- Ability to read the news using Washington Times--- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.--- Ability to get set-up email apps, calendar, etc.--- Ability to play games that can be downloaded from the app store.- Testing:Wi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.- Saving money on purchasing the Fire:--- For users who want more storage, I would strongly recommend getting the Fire 7 (16 GB) and then purchasing a microSD card as opposed to getting the costlier Fire 7 (32 GB tablet). For context, users can get a 64 GB microSD card for around $12 (users might be able to get a cheaper microSD card on Amazon prime day) on Amazon which is cheaper than paying an additional $20 for Fire 7 32 GB. Additionally, the user gets more storage by getting a microSD card.--- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles the user to a ($10 app store credit value), so you are essentially paying $ 39.99 for the 16 GB Fire 7 tablet.--- The cost for the 16 GB Fire 7 will be $49.99 (with special offers) or 32 GB Fire 7 for $69.99 (with special offers). Customers can disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Fire with special offers. Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 devices, all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the Fire with special offers and then remove the special offers..--- You can easily trade-in your prior Fire for Amazon credit (for $5-$15 depending on version and condition), which also entitles them to receive an additional 25% discount towards their new Fire.--- As previously mentioned, I would recommend avoiding purchasing extended warranty on this item.--- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get this tablet for around $20 off during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $20 in total or lesser if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.-Quality comment: Some customers have critiqued the prior version (Fire 7: 2017) for lack of long-term quality. Again, please remember that this product is sold for $49.99 and goes on sale for around $ 29.99. How much more can one expect for a product this affordable? I have used my prior Fire 7 (2015) for 4 years without any issues (Honestly, I am surprised it lasted this long). Additionally, it definitely is more durable than my iPad. Additionally, with the immense technological breakthroughs occurring at lightening speed, any tablet will be obsolete in a few years. So, it might be logically better to get an affordable average end tablet than investing in a high end one (unless you need a high-end one for your specific use).- Conclusion:To sum up my review, this is the basic Amazon Fire 7 tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. Limitations include sound quality, volume quality, and potential issues with MicroSDXC Card access, and basic app store.  Updates worth noting in this version include the new color options, a slight decrease in weight, increase in storage (internal and external), slightly faster processor, slightly improved cameras, and slight decrease in battery life (though this might be a more accurate representation of the life of the battery). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable tablet that is well-rated, small, lightweight, and can complete most of the basic and some intermediate tasks along with basic entertainment, then this Fire tablet is the way to go. So, I am giving it 5/5 stars in spite of its limitations because it is really hard (if not impossible) to find a better deal at this price point.- UPDATE # 1 (June 10, 2019): Fire HD 8I would personally recommend the Fire HD 8 (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Fire 7 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and the feature I appreciate the most - Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers (which can make a world of difference while watching or listening to something). I own both the 7 and the 8 inch, and there is a spectacular difference in sound quality and volume between the two. Besides, most phones now have an average screen size of around 5.5 inches (many companies are moving towards a 6 inches average). So, having a 7-inch tablet might not per se make a major difference for customers because it is similar in size to their phone (unless they want to use this device as a back-up device to prevent wear and tear on their phone). Additionally, since charging takes a substantial amount of time, I would rather have a tablet with longer battery life (Fire HD 8) than shorter (Fire 7). However, please note that the last argument cuts both ways as the new Fire 7 (4 hours) charges quicker as compared to the Fire HD 8 (6 hours).- UPDATE # 2 (June 15, 2019): Amazon FreeTime Unlimited- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited ($2.99/month after free subscription period)--- Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FreeTime, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FreeTime using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited in Spanish!--- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews (using FreeTime Unlimited), and manage content for up to 4 child profiles (option given during initial set-up of the tablet) with easy-to-use parental controls.”--- Generally speaking - FreeTime Unlimited offers unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after trial subscription ends).*FreeTime unlimited has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time.UPDATE # 3 (June 21, 2019):  Battery Life and SoftwareSome customers have complained about the low and unpredictable battery life for this new device. I have experienced occasional battery fluctuations (my prior Fire seemed to have better battery life). So, I am docking a star. Some other reviewers have also experienced overheating of this device. Other than the occasional overheating that occur in all devices (when complex programs/apps are used for an extended period of time), I haven’t experienced anything major until now. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the new Fire OS causing problems. I have experienced occasional staggering of the OS and app closures but nothing major as described by other reviewers. I will continue my testing to see if other issues surface but just wanted to give a heads-up to customers so they are prepared in case they experience any issues in the future and want to contact Amazon about it.Please also note several resources were used in the compilation of this review but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section.

I have other sized Fire tablets (8 Inch) and a new ipad, plus the new Kindle paper white, but the Fire 7 is my go to tablet. What I use it for. Prime Video, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube.  Kindle reader for books and bible. Audible books from audible. Podcasts (stitcher). Comixology for comics (old school Marvel fan!). Instagram (I do not use facebook). Home automation with Alexa (control of my lights, ring alarm, alarms, and basic questions) works great both hands free as well as pressing the home button.  I also play light games on it, Word search, Temple run, Angry Birds series of games, Yahtzee, Subway Surfer, Crossy Roads, and a few others.  I also listen to Amazon prime music (Apple music does not work on this device).  I mainly use my Apple air buds when watching and listening and it sounds fantastic.  Picture quality is great.  This is a snappy little tablet and my favorite size.  It feels good in the hand with the solid plastic build (compared to the Fire 8 inch, which feels more ""cheap""). It is a great tablet to use while lying in bed, which is mainly when I use it (ipad 9.7 is to heavy). I feel that Amazon finally got it right with this new 2019 version. The previous versions are painfully slow to load anything, and that is why I never would recommend them especially for a child.  These new tablets are so much better, my wife wants one, and I will be buying them for my kids, something I would not even consider before, because of the frustration of the slowness (and the reason my kids took over the ipad and iphones in the first place).  As you can see this is a consumption device, meant for fun..not a computer or workhorse.  I should mention you can check email and use the tablet for video chatting and dropping in on other echo devices which works really well and my kids have fun using it, I should also mention that I am a Prime member and take advantage of the Prime photo storage, which any picture that I take on my iphone, pops up on my Fire Tablet. I should also mention why I use this for reading more than my paper white, it is because I like the ""page curl effect"" and the way it highlights my passages on books (I still use my paper white..but this is just a preference). The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 2mp camera (which I do not use much) and the battery life, which is actually not bad, but Amazon asked for a ""star"" rating on those two features as well as tablet as a whole.  At $50 you can not go wrong. Plus if you have a previous version, just trade it in. I got $10 knocked off and an additional 20% savings. I think I paid about $33.  I will be trading in my 8 inch Fire for this size as well.  Great little tablet!",I can finally recommend the Fire 7,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,"3,053 people found this helpful",,3076,10,12454,Public

Each time when I am setting it up, and ask myself why I bought another one. I will not be purchasing another amazon tablet again, and here is why.There are some PROS to this tablet. They are cheap so I can buy one for all my kids to use / The battery life is really good / They are good enough hardware wise to run pretty much whatever kids games my kids download / That's where the pros end.CONS - The cons of this device far out weigh the pros. This tablet displays enough ads to choke a horse / The tablet is very slow. every few months I have to factory reset it when it is slows to a crawl without any indication as to why / Storage is low at 16GB. I added a 64GB sd card to each tablet. however this does not solve the issue, because in order for the SD card to be effective, the app has to be SD card compatible which only 10% of them are. So most apps will remain on the tablet with no way to transfer them to the SD card  / The home screen is full of garbage, and useless apps and features that my kids will never use, and just ends up confusing them. There is no way to clean the home screen up. My kids won't use GoodReads, or exclusive offers, or Shopping, or New Stand, or any of the other 45 home screens chalk full of crap. It would be nice if I could disable those home screens and just have ONE main home screen with their apps on it. If I want to buy them a book, or if they are dying to read the latest editions on new stand, then that should be inside the amazon app, not plastered on the home screen.  My kids also don't use email, so I went in to uninstall that, you can't. to free up resources and storage, I wanted to uninstall email, weather, amazon deals, good reads, audible, New Stand, Maps, Offers, Shop Amazon, and several other apps, but you can't they are locked down.I figured there has to be a way to remove the ads, well there is. Pay amazon 15.00 to enroll in the service to remove the ads from the device. WOW is all I can say.  After being a Prime member for over 6 years, I am really starting to reach that ""Enough is enough"" point.The bottom line is, spend the extra 50.00 and buy a real tablet. It will save you a lot of money in the long run because your child won't go to the ""SHOP"" home screen and order you a bunch of stuff on your behalf when you see 3 delivery trucks roll up outside your window, 14 new newsstand subscriptions in the mail, a 6 year audible membership, and 145 amazon prime movie purchases, all thanks to the quick and easy home screen layout.",Waste of Money,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,285 people found this helpful,,555,236,5778,Public

Amazon knows there is a problem with charging ports, and unless you have extended warrenty its only covered for 90 days.and take care of it, as I said avid reader, I love amazon and my kindle, it gets knocked around on my night stand, in car (read on work breaks) ect.and do your research, google bad charge ports for kindle, there are complaints but also ALOT of suggestions for how to repair yourself. even with the problems I have had, I always try to repair or buy new because I have ALOT of reading to do :)I hope this helps someone else",why I love and hate my kindles :),Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: Twilight BlueStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,62 people found this helpful,,170,329,46728,Public

Also, the size was perfect for reading in bed. I wanted to try the 7 inch because my phone is too small, and my 10 inch tablet is too heavy to hold up and read while I'm trying to fall asleep, now that I'm older. So I learned that a 7 inch size is perfect for this function. That's where the pros end for me.The cons:1) While the Fire does allow you to increase font size on web pages, it does not allow you to increase font size of tablet's menus so I still had to squint and strain, even with my glasses on. Not designed well for middle-aged people or older.2) You are forced to use Silk Browser which has an ugly orange logo. (All the Amazon apps are ugly orange and black, or orange and white, great for Halloween but...) I tried to download Firefox, Chrome, and Edge, but none are offered through Amazon's appstore.3) Most of the apps I used are not available through the Appstore either4) But the  biggest reason of all for my decision to return the device after 24 hours of use, is because after downloading several different keyboards that all claimed to have a microphone, and not being able to find it anywhere, I finally caved and contacted device support and was told that the builtin microphone on the Fire is not a working feature of any keyboard. It is only intended to be used with Alexa. So, as a person who likes to walk and talk (jotting down notes as I speak and pace) and a person who likes singing karaoke through apps that can't be downloaded to this device, I learned that the Fire is not the right tablet for me.It's too bad, because I would have liked to have kept it but it needs more customization options, more app availability, and a mic. Users aren't really allowed to control much on this device. Oh one other thing I don't like is how it began automatically downloading TV shows I didn't ask for on day 2. And it was constantly showing me things to shop for on Amazon.","No Mic on ANY Keyboard, Limited Apps",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: SageStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,19 people found this helpful,,1291,341,5148,Public

I went online and turned off the offer notification, only to be charged an extra $15 WITHOUT prior notification (or any notification for that matter, so beware!).  It might make sense to buy one of their kids versions at a discounted rate, say, around Black Friday, as those don't have all of these annoying ads and you actually have an adult profile for that tablet too, which is the same as what you'd have from this.  My daughter's kids version has been very reliable and I can switch over to the adult version any time I want to use it or make changes.  So, I guess I'd say that the fire tablet with special offers isn't worth it.  Get the kids version, pay for the version without the offers, or find a different tablet altogether.

It has serious flaws that I pointed out to Amazon. They said they would fix it and get back to me the following week.

THEY ARE HIDING ITS FLAWS TO MAKE A FORTUNE OFF OF PEOPLE AS STUPID AS I WAS, WHO ACTUALLY BUY THIS JUNK.

Instead, it is now 6 MONTHS SINCE PURCHASE AND I AM STILL BEING LIED TO AND IGNORED. The Amazon daily double. I'm told they will get back to me by Monday. Apparently that is the Monday after the Apocalypse. It never comes.

You can time the loading of larger numbers of books with a sun dial, and the system decides on its own to go to other sites or to just reload at random. I bought this to put in a large number of books for an Alaska trip. It is so unreliable that I took a tablet with less storage instead. Basically, get this if your standards are low and you don't mind being deceived by Amazon for months. I have bought an awful lot from Amazon in the past, including more than 25,000 books, but this version of their kindle is the worst in many ways, and destroys a lot of previously established goodwill.

But they will not replace the device even with a refurbished model. If I'd like to purchase another, they'd be happy to offer me a small discount. Of course that device also has a 90 day guarantee.

First of all, Amazon failed to ship the item out in the allotted ""Prime"" time frame  not a good first impression.Next off we have packaging.  I was somewhat embarrassed for Amazon when I found they actually pack these in the cardboard equivalent of a value meal bag.  Never have I seen a tablet that did not come in a protective box.  Id seen these little ""bags"" sitting around at Best Buy before. But I just assumed that it was something you took to the register and they gave you your safely boxed tablet. Haha, yeah right.The screen quality on this is horrible. In all honesty, the RCA tablets at Walmart look better (and come in a box). The touch on the unit isn't that great either. It was randomly responding straight out of the box.  Oddly enough, this was cured by adding a tempered glass.This is an Android based tablet and it does not come with Google Play Store. You have to download apk files off the internet and get it. But this thing is so locked down that it won't let you search certain things on Google Play that are on Amazon's app store.  You literally are forced to get them from Amazon...even some free ones.PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING AS IT IS NOT CLEAR (AT THE TIME OF THIS REVIEW)So, when you see the tablet in search results, It says $49 and there is an option drop down. Well the $49 in for some kind of promotions (Great, must be some kind of sale running.). Wrong.  So just like the value meal bag, Amazon has a lock screen unlike any other tablet I've seen.  There's ads for Apps etc on the lock screen. What?!  So, after searching Goigle and figuring how to turn them off, finally got that fixed.  Mind you, nothing in that process mentioned any charges.Later on I was reading my email and found one charging me $17 for promotions from Amazon.  I called in and got some rude girl from an overseas call center (because it would be to easy to route me to the local center I guess). Who tried to tell me that I got ""a discount"" so I had to have ads or be charged.  After an arguement about my first amendment right to express my disgust at Amazon for thinking they have more rights than any other tablet manufacturer, she refunded me...but failed to tell me she was turning the ads back on. Good thing I had since to ask.  I demanded her supervisor and she tried to tell me the supervisor would agree with her. I demanded the sup again. He came on the line and I explained how shady the advertisement for the product was and how unfair it is to charge someone without their permission. He agreed, left the credit for the charge for me.

Five years is a long time for tech, so I looked into trading in my old device for the 9th generation.  I received the 9th generation tablet today and after a mere ten hours of playing with the new device, I will be sending it back.The first thing I've noticed is that there is very little difference between the 5th generation and the 9th generation.  More storage is not a big draw for me since I can just use an SD card.  The screen is notably sharper.  Apparently, battery life is better.  Barely.  Most of the specs are identical.  It even fits in my old 5th generation case, so not having to buy a new case was also a plus.However, as soon as I upgrade, I lost access to all my Amazon Underground apps.  I am not much of a game person, but when I first bought the 5th generation, the Amazon Underground was a major contender for the Kindle fire tablets.  Amazon Underground allowed 100% FREE ACCESS to millions of games.  This meant you could play to your heart's content and never pay a dime.  All in-app purchases were suspended.Since I've been using this device for five years, I had no idea Amazon discontinued the Amazon Underground program in 2019.  All my apps that I downloaded to my original device still work.  But when I ""upgraded"" to 9th generation, all that was available to me were the regular version of the games.""No big deal,""  I thought.  I'll just save those games to an SD card and load them to the new tablet.  I bought a brand new SD card today specifically for this purpose. Surprise, surprise, when I inserted the SD card with all my ""Actually Free"" games, I got a message on the 9th generation telling me the card was ""incompatible"" with my new device, even though I got no such message on the 5th generation.  The 9th generation did give me a friendly message stating that I could make the SD card compatible with the new device if I erased it.  As the Church Lady would say, ""How conveeeeenient!""Again, I'm not much of a gamer, but the ""actually free"" banner across all those games was what set the kindle fire apart from other tablets.  Now, it's just a tablet - and a slow one.  Why would I want the new kindle when I could get a faster, sharper android device instead?  (And I do have the google play store sideloaded onto my 5th generation; I'm not going to go through that process again just to have a sharper, more crisp looking screen and lose access to all the free games).Finally, this is a very minor issue, but I notice the fonts are not 100% universal on the 9th generation.  For example, the drop down menu at the very top of the device (the one that has your bluetooth, airplane mode, and blue shade icons) does not change.  When you make the font bigger, that menu stays tiny.Needless to say, there is absolutely nothing wrong with my 5th generation Kindle 7.  I will be returning the 9th generation tablet and using my 5th - with all its free games -- until it officially bites the dust.

The oldest two, a 4th and 3rd grader, were both at a beginning 2nd grade reading level (thanks West Palm Beach schools!). The younger twins, starting kindergarten a couple of weeks ago, didn't know their alphabet or numbers (their working parents had paid a government subsidized Pre-K school to not do that over the summer).  Their parents said they knew their ABC's but all they could do was sing the ABC song; if you pointed at a letter and asked which one it was they had no clue what I was asking. ""What's a letter?""  They didn't know one from the other, much less how to write them.  (Yes, parents, you are responsible for your kids education, not the schools. Enough said.)As a former college professor, who taught how to integrate technology in a teacher training program, with 90 graduate units in education under my belt, I had to intercede.  I started reading sessions after school with the older two kids where I used my older Kindle and my two Samsung Galaxy Tablets, a 7"" and a 10"", to share reading the same book as they took turns reading out loud while I followed along to give support as needed.I was delighted to stumble over the Kindle Reader ""Wordwise"" feature that let's the kids touch a pre-selected difficult word and both see the definition and hear the pronunciation. (I hope eventually they can touch any word and have the same feature.) After an hour of reading I let them play with a couple of word games and they competed with each other to get higher scores.  Little did I know that the games came with the option of ""buying"" hints to accelerate their scores -- until two $35 charges showed up on my credit card statement.  While I was thrilled to see how engaged the kids were with the learning games I realized I needed more control over the tablets.After some research I discovered the Kindles have both parental controls, and another layer of protection through the Kindle  app, ""FreeTime"" (not available on the Samsung Tabs).  AND Kindle has a ""family package"" subscription where I can share apps with 4 tablets plus two parent units.  I bought four Fire 7s, along with screen protector film, cute foam protector cases with built in stand flaps, and over the ear head phones.Yes, it took hours to set them all up.  But it was easy and intuitive as I tweaked so many options: the time of day they could use the Kindle, how much time they have to use each media type from the ""education"" domain before they can play entertainment media, the amount of time they can use it altogether, both weekdays and weekends. FreeTime categorizes all available media as either educational or entertainment. You can set a time limit on each of the media types, e.g., apps/games, books, audible audio, and video, so that all of the educationally categorized media have to be viewed for your set time before the entertainment apps can be seen. I set up 1 hour of each media type with unlimited screen time so if they actually do get in 4 hours of learning in a given day they can play, especially on the weekend.I have yet to view the educationally classified  videos or audio content, so I may change my mind, but at the moment I would like to see the option to not allow videos or Audible as I anticipate it will eventually require maintenance time to liberate memory. There is a Storage management option that will archive unused apps and even let you use a SD card (not included) but I anticipate memory will periodically need to be manually cleared as well.  I would also like to be able to only display on their home page the apps that I select for them. The number of available media on their home page, even if educational, are a constant distraction for them that requires me to supervise their use and redirect them back to the apps I selected that focus on the skills I want them to practice.As I observed one of the twins use a Kindle (I hadn't tweaked yet) for the first time I was almost amused to find she could spend a seemingly unlimited amount of time with (to me) a mind numbingly boring ""construction""  app that simply pushed a donkey up a pile of bricks, made him jump down, and build another pile of bricks, jump down, etc.  I would love to see what brain waves and endorphins were exercised in that app as she was almost addicted by the process.  Needless to say, I had to pull her away from that app and threaten to take the Kindle away if she didn't go back to one of the letters or numbers apps I had selected for her. Fortunately she would rather do the educational games than watch TV or anything else. WOW!Additional options let me select content by age appropriateness. The 4th grader wanted to play a kindergarten game her sister was playing so I had to expand the age setting in her profile to encompass the lower grade apps. Perhaps that's a better idea as the older kids can strengthen or even learn skills they didn't pick up in the earlier grades.Right below that option is my favorite selection, ""Enable In-App Purchasing"". Off.Bottom line - what an amazing resource for parents.  If I had my way every kid in every school would have one.",Great teaching tool for kids!,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,,62,66,679554,Public

The Paperwhite is preferable when I'm reading outside and need long battery life. But I do most of my reading indoors near a power source, where a pad's flexibility and color display are useful; that's the niche the Fire7 fits very well.The Fire7 hardware provides terrific value. Its speed and display are just fine for the mere fifty bucks it costs, and far more than adequate for the demands I put on it. The main thing (understandably) missing is GPS. And it's light, especially when used without a cover.Where the Fire7 falls short is in the apps. I'm *especially* disappointed with the Kindle app (called ""Books"" on the Fire7). I've grown very fond of continuous scroll in both the iOS and standard Android apps that Amazon provides for other platforms. Why did they cripple the continuous scroll feature on the Fire7, when it's an app written by Amazon and used on Amazon hardware? Because it's not there, I'll continue to rely on my almost-ancient standard Android mini-pad for most of my reading. The feature is that important.In addition, of course, we're all familiar with the limits Amazon puts on apps in its app store. As just one example, I can get Google Drive but not Google Maps (the Maps app on the Fire7 is far less capable). If the issue is royalties, why not charge a small fee for apps that standard Android users have easy access to?Bottom line: Amazon has a potentially *great* product in the Fire7, but has chosen to cripple that potential with the apps it makes available to users.

Who doesn't?And my old Ipad is starting to finally kick the proverbial dust after years of abuse.  The battery is finally starting to take forever to charge, and there's lagging issues due to it being so old, and the updates are just killing it more.  But it is still beloved to my four year old, who somehow commandeered it.All that being said, I was so excited when it finally came in!  It looked awesome, was a little different with the controls all at the top, including the volume, power, charging port, and headphone jack, with the speaker not at the bottom of the device but on the left side, which was an odd placement I thought after I put a case on it, and I typically hold it where the speaker is located.  The opposite side close to the top is the slot for an SD card.  There are no front buttons as it's fully touchscreen also.I already knew before going in that you could not use Goggle Play, although I'm sure there's a way to get around it.  I basically wanted to use it for videos for both myself and my daughter, games, and the occasional book and web browsing.  Now, keep in mind we have super fast Internet.

Once on, it was a pretty nice setup, especially for those that are already ""in"" with Amazon as it shows a Home screen with my recent book/audiobook purchases up top, then all my apps below it, the next page shows Books, and includes some books from my library as well as recommendations below it, Videos is next, followed by Games, Shop (which was so odd as it shows things I've looked at), Apps, Music, and Newsstand.So basically, if you do a lot of Amazon shopping, listen to Audible as well as Amazon Music, watch Amazon videos, and read Kindle books, then this might be for you.If you don't use Amazon that frequently, then I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a regular tablet, one that is not hardwired for their Amazon customers.Now in my personal use, because I do use a lot of their services, I do like it.  But it's also dang annoying.  I suppose it's coming from having owned Apple devices, and Samsung devices that I find this tablet to lag tremendously.  Actual startup from the time you press the power button takes about 40 seconds to pop on.  Not too shabby, but there is a lag from opening the lock screen to opening apps that isn't apparent in a good quality Apple or Samsung product.  And let's not forget the horrible lag from going from one profile to the next.  It takes forever, and at this point, I finally erased the profile I set up for my daughter. I loved that I would be able to limit her usage as we already do that, but in this way she couldn't even get on without my code.  You can download what apps they can use, and manage their profile fully, which is great!  But on the flip side, I can't seem to figure out how to get back to my profile without shutting the whole thing down or restarting it as it opens right to her page versus the lock screen when opened back up.And as I previously stated, you can use the Amazon apps, but there aren't as many apps as can be found in Apple.  There are some I love to use, and they do not have them available at all, which sucks.  Amazon's browsing is called Silk, and works fine, although I still find it slow with fast Internet.  The quality of the screen and the battery are two other issues that are definitely cheap and sub par.  The screen quality on browsing has the slightly blurred look of a cheap android tablet. Words are ok, such as in an article, but pictures are blurred, and even video is not that clear or crisp.  The battery is also very weak I've found.  I've had my phone on since six this morning, and turned the tablet on around 10 this morning.  My phone, which I've used all morning to make calls, text, watch a few video's, look at FB, browse, etc., is down to 76% battery.  The tablet, which I've used to download four apps and had maybe about 20 minutes of use and has been on standby is down to 75%.  The battery does not last long at all.  If you watch even a few videos on the tablet, you can easily watch the percentage slowly bottom out.The camera is what you would normally find on a cheap tablet, and I wasn't expecting much nor did I get much in return.  The kindle portion is fantastic, and I can read easily on it, but I also own a Kindle, and I prefer that to this as the glare is greatly reduced even though you can change the page color and brightness of the screen.  I do like seeing the book covers in color though, and maps or things throughout the book that would normally be colored, but otherwise it is still nice to be able to read on it well.  Alexa works totally well, and it's easy to use, and I like the fact that you can use Alexa to play some games.  My daughter is fascinated with her.In all, this is an okay basic entry tablet that's good for watching videos, and is more tuned towards Prime members who have a lot of Amazon features already.  I'm going to keep it as I wanted something cheap for my youngest daughter to watch videos and keep her occupied, and for my occasional browsing.  But if you want a crystal clear screen, no lag, and better selection of apps, then I would definitely recommend going with an Apple or different Android device.","Depending On Your Use, This Might Not Be For You",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,,2446,910,3542,Public

For that purpose solely it is adequate. It was used daily for several months then less and less as work gets busy. My 10"" tablet no longer holds a charge (it was returned once for this reason already and in my experience is a common Amazon Fire issue) and the 10"" tablet is used hours upon hours each day, everyday. The 7"" has barely been used this year during the pandemic, but was picked up today for some light internet searching and one game thats been installed for months but only played one time. This device is just a slow piece of garbage. The typical Fire menus across the top of the homepage only show For You and Home. Every site is too large for Silk to load so things have been disabled. This will be the last Amazon tablet I buy.I have an 8"" (2018) , 10"" (7th gen), 7"" HDX (3rd gen) and now this new 7"" (2019). I bought this new version for the Hoopla app which provides free access to books using your library card. The app is no longer supported on my old HDX and I was getting tired of bringing my huge 10"" to work everyday just to listen to audio books. I use the 10"" for everything else and I wanted it to stay at home. I planned to buy the 7"" in June when it premiered but I waited for the reviews and because the negatives pointed out things that weren't improved from my old HDX or the 10"" I decided to look elsewhere. Then on Prime Day I read the reviews again and though they were about the same I decided that I could live with the major complaints others had and thought I'd probably avoid the more minor complaints since those were likely exaggerated or isolated. Plus, I didn't need great sound (a huge complaint I have about all my other kindles too) since it would be used only with Bluetooth headphones. I didn't need perfect screen quality since its only use would be audiobooks. My major concern was would there be enough storage to temporarily download about 15-20 books over a course of a month, at about 5 at a time. My old HEX struggled there. So, I got the kindle deliverd just after Prime Day though there was a little delay since it was a popular item. I didn't even open it for almost 3 weeks while I waited for a protective cover. When I got confirmation the cover would arrive any day I decided to go ahead and add Hoopla and start downloading books. I played with it for about 4 days off and on and it I started to notice issues that reviews had mentioned. The browsing was slow, loading images is pretty delayed, it dropped the internet connection a few times and I had trouble getting my smart thermostat set up on Alexa. Still, the goal was only to listen to downloaded audio books so none of this mattered too much. Then about 5 days before my return period expired (8/19/19) I couldn't get Hoopla to open. I opened it one time, downloaded books, left the device and didn't pick it up again until the cover was installed. I started to panic when it wouldn't work so I contacted Amazon, explained the issues I noticed and they easily agreed to a replacement. However they set up a replacement for an 8"" so I had to contact them before it shipped to let them know they were sending the wrong item. The second agent was helpful but she wanted to do more troubleshooting (first agent already did but I was happy to try because I didn't want to return it) before agreeing to a replacement. We tried her way but nothing changed. She asked me to contact Hoopla and try the device for a couple more days since I still had a few days left to return it. Hoopla helped me get the app working a day later. Crisis averted! I took it to work this week and was only able to use it a few times, less than 2hrs each day, but had no issues. Again, I'm only listening to it so there's not a lot that could go wrong. Usually I'd use it 5-6 days a week, 6-10 hrs a day so it was an unusual week. It's Sat late night now, I'm doing chores and listening to a book with Bluetooth and it's dropping the Bluetooth connection so often I've lost count. It's happening as frequently as every 10 mins. I'm so disappointed. All those ""exaggerated"" and ""isolated"" reviews were spot on. This thing isn't stable or reliable.",Disappointed. I thought the negative reviews must be wrong.

The display is crisp & clear enough and the touch responsiveness is on point (no pun intended).

Anyway, the speaker is the only gripe I have about this tablet and it does have Bluetooth so you can connect it to a better speaker, I use a Thumper 808 with mine and I love the crap out of it 😊.

The box the Kindle Fire itself came in had no protective foam or even cardboard.I figured I would test the Fire to see 1) if it even worked after all the jostling around (& possible dropping) 2) to see if I actually would want to replace it if I liked how it worked & what it offered.Pros:None the product was broken.

Since this tablet was broken I'm not sure if it's always the case, but the 2nd time I turned it on, all the apps I'd forced to stop were back on.The rest of the cons are from when I first turned it on & it was working & from reading help articles on how the Kindle Fire works, so the information is correct.You cannot remove the app icons from your home screen & you do not have another screen to drag them to so you don't have to see them.

I use large font, so my home page icons are huge.Since this Kindle Fire arrived packed so poorly I contacted customer service via Chat on Amazon & could not get a straight answer on whether or not a new Kindle Fire would be packed in protective packaging (which was very odd to me). I will be returning this Kindle Fire & looking at other tablets instead.",Does Not Allow App Removal That Come On Tablet,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: PlumStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,,52,66,3905387,Public

Perfect for an adult. However, we bought these for my 4 children because they have Alexa and conveniently 4 colors. I set up the child profiles. Followed all of the steps when setting up a child profile, it said they would NOT be able to make purchases. I was relieved because they are linked to your Amazon account and therefore, your card. However, i found out a week later that they CAN make purchases. My 2 yr old was on his and bought a few things, still not sure exactly what all it was. I was so upset.. a child profile set up for a 2yr old is allowed to make purchases! I had to go in and lock down their tablets, causing them to lose Alexa. (Using the Parental controls disables alexa. That and because it said child profiles cannot make purchases is why I didnt turn the controls on to begin with.) When I set them all up, it said child profiles couldnt make purchases TWICE. So, I left parental controls off just so they could keep alexa. My 2,5 & 7 yr old love to use Alexa because 2 &5 cant read or write yet & 7 cannot spell everything properly yet. I taught them to speak to their devices and they were all doing great. Now they barely even want to touch them cause they dont have Alexa to help them find what they want.Oh, and every time you get an alert from your amazon purchases, they go to every tablet! My sons birthday is tomorrow and he already was alerted when each gift shipped! I had no idea it did that til I picked his up and saw ""your item/package: ... shipped!"" Full description of each item. Idk what to do now. I ASKED ALEXA several times in several different ways ""how to keep the tablets out of my shopping cart"" or to ""disable Amazon alerts"" to the tablet and she said she found nothing on that.

I purchased this tablet so I could load Defender Publisher's 70 ebook collection. I assume no fault towards Defender Publisher or Amazon Kindle it will only allow me to load the content as a pdf file. This makes reading the books harder because you can not save where you left off or highlight anything. So this left me extremely disappointed. I had the option of going with a Nook using this downloadable cdrom but I didn't know that with Kindle I do not have the option to load the Nook app (I know this is a competitor) or that it would only load as a pdf with Kindle. Had I known this I would not have bought this Kindle. Seeing that I have purchased this I will just use it for other things, so I thought. So here is why I give it a one star.I took this outside hoping I can read it but the screen was so dark no matter how much adjusting I did. Sorry but Nook has Kindle beat there. They have an otion to use outside changing the screen’s lighting.When trying to scroll via touch, the screen skips really bad. Like it takes it a second to realize I am trying to scroll up or down. So a slight delay.Also my biggest complaint and one that applies to Amazon.com. Advertisements! Seriously? What the heck? I did NOT purchase this Kindle to be advertised too and No I am NOT paying 15 dollars to shut that off. That is WRONG to charge me additonal to unsubscribe the special offers. What a rip off. This is why I am giving this a bad review, right here. The other things I could have easily ignored. But this here angers me. This is my Kindle. I purchased this. I should have the option of what stays and what goes on my Kindle without being charged for it. This here is why I am debating on sending this back. Which just might happen especially when I said the only reason why I purchased this was to get these loadable books but seeing how that wasn't what I thought, this might be returned. Sorry Amazon, but not happy here.

My children who use these are all between 8 and 14 years old. They are at ages where some of them know tech as well or better than myself, so I needed Parental Controls that were on point to give them access to resources and content without exposing them to porn, extreme violence, or predators. The Kindle Fire 7 definitely delivers in that respect. Everyone's standards are different, so I love the fact that you can allow Amazon to screen content by age and set that age yourself! Anything above PG (and some edgier PG choices) that my teen or preteen read or watch, are either viewed with my supervision or previously screened before we watch or read together so that we can discuss anything that we need to. As such, the highest age setting for Amazon curated content on these portable handheld devices in our house is age 9, even though my oldest is 14. This allows for differences in opinion that I might have about what content is appropriate and the fact that all of that content can be viewed in private. I have disabled the browser through parental controls for anything other than this curated content and specific websites and youtube videos that I have added to their content individually. This is a SUPER feature!!! For each child, I added access to videos of things that interest them such as woodworking, cooking, crafting, favorite music artists, magic tricks, and more.Books can be added as content as well, so I am able to take out library e-books and audiobooks through my app for them and only share what is theirs.The app offerings through Amazon are not as extensive as other operating systems, but there are plenty of word games, Teach My Monster to Read, Starfall, Candy Crush, Roblox, Mincraft, some Lego Games, Crossy Road, photo editors, and painting apps. My children don't play the ones with in-game messaging or chat and do not have social media accounts. They have games to practice math skills, learn languages, and develop other skills. You have the option to set educational goals for kids and the option require them to meet them before accessing entertainment if you'd like. I don't,  because I want them to read and build skills for fun, which they might not if required.I have curfews and time limits set individually for each child that can be turned off or on through my Amazon account on my phone, where I can also view exactly what each child has been doing on their tablet and for how long.Overall, my children might have enjoyed a Galaxy Tab more with its increased access to games and the internet less focus on parental controls,  but they are thoroughly enjoying their Amazon Fire 7 tablets AND we have peace of mind that they are safe.Also, the value on these can't be beat. We had both a Galaxy Tab and another Amazon Kindle Fire in the past and BOTH ended up worn out or broken after about 2 years of use.

My LG Gpad had quit on me some time ago, and I wanted an adequate replacement, which I believed this was. It was not. Here's the tablet worked well enough, and after a ""thorough"" set up process I started using it. The first thing I attempted was screen mirroring. Turns out that this model doesn't support screen mirroring. After a lengthy search of seeing if there was a way to enable screen mirroring, I threw in the towel on that. It left me asking the question of how could it be possible that my six year old LG tablet can support Miracast, and when I did use it, it worked very well. Yet a brand new tablet with supposed better technology can not, or will not?Okay, maybe there's some other features that would be worthwhile using. After putting it down for about a minute, I was greeted by an ad for Progressive Insurance. This tablet is AD SUPPORTED.

For me, battery life is 75% of what's advertised on Amazon. To get full use out of the tablet, you've got to install the Google Play Store. It isn't natively installed on the device.

They are what they are; inexpensive Android tablets. Yes, they run Amazon's version of Android, but they are basically Android tablets with a skin on them. The screens are acceptable, and while they are not the snappiest tablets around they work for my needs. Remember, this is only a $50 tablet folks. Temper your expectations.There are two reasons that I purchased the Fire tablet as opposed to a commodity Android tablet (Walmart and Best Buy sell a few for about $50 with similar specs). The first is that there are accessories for the Fire tablets that are widely available and built for these tablets. I purchased three rubber bumper cases (one for each kid's Fire tablet). The same cannot be said for commodity tablets. There is almost always some sort of compromise with universal accessories. I don't have to make those compromises with the Fire.The second reason I selected the Fire tablets is because of the widely touted parental controls that are baked into the Fire OS. To be fair, should you enable ""FreeTime"" on the tablets (in other words, create a kid's profile), the parental controls are amazing. You are able to set operating hours on the tablet for either weekdays or the weekend, limit the amount of time spent on certain content, and limit total screen time. Should you choose to spend the extra money and enroll in ""FreeTime Unlimited,"" there is a wide swath of pre-screened content that will be available to your child on demand.Unfortunately, there is a significant negative to the Kid's profiles as well. You are unable to share in in-app-purchases with the Kid's profile. I would estimate that over the past couple of years I have spent around $100 on in-app-purchases for children's games that my kids enjoy. I can share these apps with the Kid's profile, but any purchases that I made in those apps are not available to my kids. Amazon has started to allow in-app-purchases from a Kid's profile, but that does me no good for the investment I have already made. I also was unable to get a clear response with regards to whether or not my kids could share any in-app-purchases made through the kid's profiles (I spent over two hours in chat with Amazon reps trying to understand exactly how FreeTime worked).Because of this my children will continue to use an adult profile to access their tablets. You can still enable parental controls like a curfew or ratings limits. You just don't have the same granular level of control you would have if they were using a kid's profile. Considering the resources that Amazon is able to bring to bear on a problem, this suggests to me one of three things:1) The recent lawsuits about kids making purchases spooked them2) Amazon wants to make money by forcing you to purchase content that you have already purchased3) Amazon wants to force you into a FreeTime Unlimited subscription, which ironically wouldn't solve my problem eitherSo would I buy one of these again? Absolutely. They seem to be of slightly higher quality than commodity tablets you can get for the same price. The only reason that this does not get a 5 star rating from me is that the kid's profile setup does not allow in-app-purchases to be shared. This is an extreme negative for me.",Parental controls are not as good as advertised without FreeTime,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,,20,51,1602476,Public

I loaded all of my books and podcast onto a 400 GB micro SD card, and it's an awesome little media tablet, which frees up my phone and laptop for work or play.I'll note here that I replaced the default Amazon interface by downloading a very simple hack, followed by installing the Nova Launcher, and now it's a standard Android tablet rather than an Amazon tablet. Amazon is amazing, no doubt, but I do my shopping on my phone, and have other plans for this tablet.The most unexpected bonus of the Fire 7 is it's ability to emulate nes, snes, gb, gbc, gba, sg, and sms, flawlessly, AND even PSP and PS1, with a 90% compatibility rate. The biggest drawback of this model is having only 1 GB of ram, however, for retro emulation, ebooks, and media viewing, you don't really need a super computer, and this tablet will work fine.If you want high end audio, you'll need a Bluetooth speaker or something that connects via 3.5 audio jack. I've tested this and it's flawless.Honestly, I can't believe this tablet is only $50. I highly recommend it for all of your basic media and gaming needs.",Best tablet in $50 price range!,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,50,51,1788107,Public

No glare on screen. Gotta give credit when it is due. + 1 Star for this.The Kindle Fire tablets suck at being a tablet but is an alright eReader at best. The software the tablet comes with is Fire Os. This locks the tablet down to Amazon's very limited app store. I would recommend installing the google play store (you can google how to do this). This will open the door for additional apps but retains that horrible fire os interface. The interface has several pages that are really just store fronts and cannot be deleted. If you select anything in it just opens the corresponding app. IE you go to the books page and select a book, it just throws you into Kindle app that anyone can download on ios or android. Same with the Music and video pages just opens Amazon Prime Music and Video respectively.The hardware sucks also. The back cover colors are a nice touch but screen resolution is worse than most budget smartphones. Now you could make the argument that the Kindle Fire 7 screen is larger than your phone screen. I would respond that yes and most people have a larger screen than that located on something called a television. And unless it’s a Tube TV, your television has a better resolution also. What's up with that charging port? I have had to 2 charging ports on 2 separate kindles go out on me with the latest one only lasting 2 months. It charges well at first, then over time you will have to hold the charging cable a certain way and then finally it does not charge at all becoming a brick.It's 1gb of ram is just pitiful. It is fine for reading a book OR listening to music OR watching a movie but having more than 3 apps opened at a time and you will lose memory. Example I had the kindle app open on a textbook, notes app to take notes and settings app because I forgot I had it open. Jumping just between the kindle app and notes app, the kindle would lose memory and stall. In its defense, I don't know of any device with only 1gb of RAM that can run Android in 2019. Expandable storage was nice but only certain apps can be moved to an SD Card. Also the battery life is not great. I could just get 1 day on standby with no use at all in my backpack. Literally have to charge it every day.Again alright eReader but horrible tablet.If you buy it, buy it on a deal for $30.",Alright eReader but horrible tablet,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: Twilight BlueStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,110,128,480935,Public

All I really want is to be able to read books and go online, so this seemed perfect.  A few things have already stood out:1.  Delivery for TERRIBLE.  Amazon listed the delivery as 'handed to a resident' but the box was actually left in the atrium of my apartment building - on the wrong side of the locked door.  And no one bothered to ring the bell.2. My so-called discount is a rip-off.  the device is subsidized by ads and 'recommendations', including full-screen ads on the lock page.  When you try to turn them off, you're advised that it'll cost $15.  So my deal was actually $5 off and ads.3. The battery is terrible but battery saver is great.  If you're not prepared to deal with the limitations imposed by battery saver (it turns on automatically at 20%) then you probably want a device with a better battery life.4. It's great with non-Amazon files.  I transfered a bunch of .mobi files while it was synced to my computer and they popped into the library without having to jump through hoops.With the exception of the ads, this kindle is basically what I was expecting.  A cheap little e-reader with great customer service and resources behind it.  This isn't an investment - it's something I can throw in my purse to read on the bus.","Exactly what I was looking for (but the ""discount"" is a joke)",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,,7,10,7053141,Public

The old kids edition fire 8 had excellent battery life I could leave it unpluged in my bag for months and it would still have around 80 percent battery. This one dies so fast it's unbelievable but I can't complain that much for the price I paid.

Unbeatable, I must say; it's a lot more that you can expect!! I am surprised this thing is such a high quality product for just few bucks (I bought mine on eBay for $39,99, but later I found it's the same price here at Amazon).AMAZON x100: It is true its operation is 100% based on a Amazon environment, and that its Android OS is a special version (with some limitations); however I  use Amazon store and services a lot, so that does not bother me at all. The inconveniences that are annoying for me I have overcome them satisfactorily...TRILLIONS OF ICONS: For example there are tons of Amazon App icons in the main screen that I don't use, and the app they belong to cannot be uninstalled (or at least I haven't found the way to do it). Well you can stop their services so they don't use tablet's resources, and occupy less memory and space that way; but the icons are still there. Also, they are not allowed to be stored in a folder (by long pressing each icon) so you have to deal with that bunch of icons in the main screen, which is very annoying (to my liking). But today I finally discovered a TRICK ;) to store them in a folder (Yeah!), so goodbye to those disturbing icons that I don't use (I just see 1 folder). My screen is already clean now, and only with the Apps that ""I"" use.AMAZON'S ANDROID: As for the OS limitations, the only one I could not overcome is that I have an annual subscription to Norton antivirus, and I have it installed on my Desktop, Laptop and Smartphone; unfortunately it cannot be installed on Fire 7 (9th gen). Today I contacted Norton technical support and they confirmed it; they say it cannot be installed due to the version of Android that Amazon uses on their tablets, which is limited and also different, with a very specific configuration that meets their tablets. Well instead I installed a free anitvirus that is going well for now (hope it protects me enough).STORAGE: As in every smartphone or tablet, internal memory is a concern of all of us (it quickly gets full); and this Fire 7 is not the exception. However it has 10.63GB for user's available internal storage (of 16GB it comes with) and I still have 8GB and something FREE, but this is because I use a 32GB MicroSD (it accepts up to 512GB) and configured all apps to store things over there. This is a good advice for all smartphone/tablet users. Oh yes, also Amazon gives you 5GB for Free in their cloud for you to store your stuff (pics, docs, music, or whatever you want). That's space you won't use in your Fire's storage so that's a nice gift.BATTERY: The battery life is awesome; what I've tested so far it gave me about 8 hours while Spotify downloaded my entire playlists for offline use. After that I gave it the second charge and have it playing music for about 5 continue hrs and the battery still has 70% remaining.SPAM: There's something that bothers me a bit which is the advertising of Amazon stuff when I unlock the screen. I haven't found how to stop it so after various attempts to get rid of it I ended up accepting to live with it. I just swipe my finger from the bottom of the screen and advertising is quickly gone.KEYBOARD: It can be set in several languages (well that's standard; I just downloaded the Spanish dictionary so it checks my spelling), but something that I liked is that it includes the Swipe method of ""writing"" (you enter words by sliding a finger from the first letter to the last; you lift only between words). I love that method and have used it in my smartphones for years now so I'm glad I found it here too.MORE TO COME: I'm so excited with my new Fire that I want to explore more functions, for example Alexa, and more other stuff that comes with the tablet. I will find the time for that later, but for now, I am very happy with what I've got.MY CONCLUSION: I am 200% satisfied with this product, I think it works sensational, at a very satisfactory speed. It plays my Spotify and MP3s playlists without problem, pairing it with my JBL Flip 4 speaker was fast and easy (and it sounds spectacular), the WiFi works perfectly, the email configuration was super fast and without problems, etc etc etc. What a good product!! And for this price, even better!!",Awesome Product!!!,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: Twilight BlueStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,377,131,2299122,Public

HOWEVER, with these new Kindles you don't have the option to store the Kindle books or Audible audiobooks in the external storage.  You can move games, etc. but not the applications that use the most storage.  Since other Kindle models allow me to store audio books, ebooks, music, photos, movies, etc. on the external storage, why can't I store those things on the external drive on these models?  My audio books especially take up a lot of storage, and this limitation is going to be a pain in the rear, because I won't be able to have all of my audio books when I travel and am not near wi-fi (especially if I also want to have some ebooks, music, movies, etc. on my Kindle).  Not sure what the advantage of extra external storage is if you can't put anything on it.  I am not going to be able to use these Kindles as I had planned.

I like it for videos but thought because it had location, it would give me GPS abilities in my car.  I didn't expect much.  Videos and GPS is all I wanted.  I got videos but no GPS hardware.  Most people, when googling, don't realize that location does not equal GPS.  It's really not good for anything else.  Would be good for kids but since there is no GPS and the Amazon update causes google play (if side loaded) to do a log in loop where it won't let you log in, this really isn't good for anything else.  Really a waste of $30 when $20 or so more I could of bought a cheap android tablet that had GPS on it.  Can't give it anything else but one star due to the lack of GPS.  Most are going to think location equals GPS and  not have the thought to google that.  Would give it more stars if it actually stated ""no GPS"" in the description or described location as no GPS hardware or something to make that fact clear!  So many bought a Fire thinking it had GPS so I am not the only one!  Also, buying a Bluetooth GPS is expensive.  Cheaper just to buy a cheap android tablet with GPS.  Steer clear if you want GPS abilities!Update:  It's horribly slow!  Watching youtube is insane!  It lags and then the audio and lips get unsynced and then I have to move it ahead and then back over and over and try to get it syced and it usually never does go back synced again.  It's super annoying.  I know it's not my internet as this NEVER happens on my phone, my blueray, or my smart tv!  Maybe it's the youtube app that's not made by google or youtube.  Because Amazon doesn't have a youtube app made by google or youtube in their store.  I downloaded another one and it happens on that too.  It doesn't happen as much on Netflix or Amazon videos but the processor in this is grap.  It does freeze on games and that makes game playing frustrating.  I have no idea how this has so many good reviews.  Yes, I sideloaded google play and get many alerts to update google play services but the processor of this should be able to handle it as these exact same apps are on my phone and my phone never freezes like this.  It's crap!  I wouldn't even give this to a kid unless it's a young kid that wouldn't care about freezing in games.  People that gave this high reviews, tell me your secert.  I can't take away the one star I already have this but would if I could.  I would NOT purchase this again.  I'd just save another $30 to $60 and get a lower cost android tablet.  This so wasn't worth it!  Even at the $29.99 Black Friday cost.  Most especially since I got the case that was the same cost as the tablet and the SD card.  Ugh!

The ads aren’t bad. I think people who are complaining are spoiled or are upset they had to settle. If you have children, obviously you never let them have access to ads because they don’t understand to not download them. In terms of the glitchy, I notice most of those reviews are with people who uses the SD card. I know it shouldn’t and I know any IT person would say I’m crazy, but adding on storage always slows down a pc. I do think over time this will begin o glitch. I saw 2 samples in store. The one that was glitchy felt older and wasn’t updated. The one that wasn’t was updated and felt smoother. So I bought the square trade protection just to be safe. I wanted a tablet for some game playing, web browsing amd amazon shopping, simple writing and reading, portable, smaller than the ipads, but bigger than the kindle screens for reading and that kindle oasis price tag is a joke. Setup was super simple and understanding how to use it doesn’t require much of a tutorial, but I can’t say that’ll be the same for you if you’re someone who yells a lot at computers and complains about this new generation.Some cons: the screen doesn’t feel good to swipe. It’s good for tapping. I am really happy I bought an anti-glare screen protector together with my purchase. I was able to put it on first thing which helped with screen feel issue and harsh light. The resolution isn’t perfect and might be too much effort for your eyes if you’re always working with 4k. It’s heavy. I swear the ipad mini is lighter even though they’re the same weight. I think it’s about weight distribution. The resolution and the weight are going to be my deal breakers. If my eyes feel dizzy or my fingers keep complaining, I’ll return it, no matter that I purchased it with a goft card. Otherwise if you have the money and you really want a tablet without the high price and you don’t notice weight, I’d recommend it. If you have an amazon bookstore nearby, I recommend checking there. I’m starting to realize that the price was a little less in store than online.It’s not a waste and won’t be something you’ll hate yourself for buying even if you do decide to return it. Just don’t wait too long to try it and decide if you want to return it.*After a few days, I’ve decided that if I had money, I would get a better tablet. The weight isn’t much of an issue anymore, but the resolution is awful. I will be keeping it b/c it’s what I wish my tablet would be and there are times where I really wish I had a tablet and this is the cheapest on the market with a brand name I trust and no need for store interaction.

I wasn't going to buy anything, I only went in to accompany my family member to pick up THEIR Black Friday deal. I was shopping around as they waited in line and after picking this up and putting it back down over and over again (as I've done to previous Fires every single Black Friday) I eventually caved. I always wanted a Fire, and as an ipad mini owner who doesn't use tablets that much, I never felt the NEED for more than 1 type of device (phone, game system, etc.) I already had a Paperwhite, why another one?Well one cute green color and debating to myself that it was the mere cost of a ""lunch out with friends"" I might as well. My mom even joked I could ""trip and fall and break it with no heartbreak"". It was THAT cheap.Pros:Functions like an ipad. For someone who has no major need for things and not a major ""glued to screen"" person, I didn't demand that much. I wanted a device that had the basic social media I could check up on: Twitter, FB, IG, etc. It has an alternative Youtube app (now, as I've seen people previously complain Fire lacked Youtube) that's called something like Youtube.com app. It can play a few games too.So in short, for a price of a lunch, it really packs a lot. You pull it out, this cheap covered (plastic) thing, yet it really compares to ipads and other tablets. For someone with not much demand (few apps, just to read), it is MORE than enough for a cheap price.- Price! On sale or not, it's still either only $30 or $50.- It functions well enough. It has the basic package of social media that can be downloaded. I use FB, Twitter and IG. I can download all of these.- Continuous scrolling in KindleCons:-The plug where the charger connects to the device (not the other USB end), is hard to charge. It is hard to push into the device and it takes a bit of a yank or wiggle to get it out of the device. I can't see this charger or the charging port to last long at all.- Gets warm after only a BIT of playing.- Slow as a slug. Slow in everything it does. I'm not in a huge rush to play or read, but it's something to keep in mind for other users. Even Kindle, if I leave and re-enter sometimes it takes for a solid bit before it really loads.- Questionable idle battery life and even more questionable active battery life. This guy DRAINS. In a world of portable batteries, it's not much of an issue, but still, battery does not last as long as it is advertised.Overall:I still love it. I don't demand much from it. I certainly don't expect much from a cheap tablet. However, for it's price, it's really good! With more and more parents shoving devices to their kids, I can see this as a starter tablet (they have kids versions too!) instead. 8/10.",It's fantastic considering it's price and how cheap it feels,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,30,40,2369243,Public

The tablet does seem to run smoother and the screen is nice. The battery life is not so good.The biggest problem with this new tablet, though, is that MANY kindle apps (free and paid) will NOT appear in Amazon FreeTime NO MATTER WHAT.

I now own the Kindle Fire 10 (2019) and the Kindle Fire 7 (2019).First be realistic - this is a 7"" tablet which offers more screen real estate than a cell phone but is not a full screen tablet. It is not my choice for watching movies and working at home (that's the Fire 10) but the 7 will be when I am traveling light and I want something larger than my cell phone.Performance is decent. It is not lightning fast but it is very fast compared to my 2012 Nexus 7 it replaces in my lineup. The 16 Gb is ample even for downloading a few movies and certainly plenty of reading content.The single speaker is good - I certainly do not find it annoying - but if traveling I will be using a BT headset or can use an external speaker.Bottom line: on sale, and then with the trade in discount, this tablet cannot be beat for an on the go, toss in your bag device (<$35).If you are comparing it to an Apple or other more expensive device, just don't - you will absolutely have better screen resolution and performance with those devices!

And mind you I am not a tech expert telling you everything about its build, but I am just your ""average Jane"" who wanted a user friendly mini tablet.I wanna start off by saying that this tablet is good for some things, and bad for others. If you want a real tablet, go elsewhere. If you want either something for your kid or a small, on-the-side-of-your-phone entertainment device, this is better. I already have a Samsung tablet to go with my phone, which I use for more advanced computer-like purposes, but I bought this Fire 7 to use more for basic fun and entertainemnt. It's there for when I want to watch TV, movies, or videos, play games, listen to music, etc. when I'd rather give my phone a break from use all day - or for when the phone is too small, or the Samsung tablet is too big. So, the 7 inch screen is the correct size for easy carry but still large enough to watch vids or play games.Before buying, I was intimidated by other reviews of ""horror"" stories about this tablet doing weird things, working on its own, being too slow, etc. and I want to say to all, that I have not had any of these issues after 5 months of moderate use, *for what it's intended for*. Of course if you want to go downloading a bunch of stuff to it that is more suited for a real tablet or smart phone, you might slow it down/mess it up a bit. Mine is not too slow, nor does it do anything haunting.One down side to it however is the battery life...it is not good. It might last a day on a full charge, and even when sitting standby, the battery is dropping as though it has been being used non stop for game play. So be aware of that. Oh, and the screen is a cheap plastic too. I hated how my finger would drag on the screen to operate it, which is something I don't notice many others mentioning. SO, for not a whole lot of money, I would invest in a glass screen protecter like I now use for it in order to have a smooth screen that more resembles a real tablet/smart phone. I also put a case on it, which there are many more options and varieties available on Amazon other than what they try to sell with the Fire 7.P.S. The add that displays on the lock screen is not a big deal at all. Some make it out to seem like its horrible, but just swipe to unlock the thing and the add goes *poof* gone. No need to spend extra money to remove that unless you really really need to.Overall, I recommend the Fire 7 for you, if you know what it is youre buying.",It can be worth it,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,,137,34,354868,Public

I mostly check daily things like email, news, social media sites, etc, in addition to reading.  I WANTED this to be a viable replacement for those tasks, but it just is not.The primary issue with this thing is SPEED - it is ridiculously and surprisingly SLOW.  Slow as in click on a link, put the reader down, sip some coffee, glance at the screen still loading, sip some more coffee, turn on the tv, and MAYBE the page will have loaded by then.  THAT kind of slow.  Mind numbing slow.  At first I considered the possibility of holding onto the table strictly for the purpose of breaking me of my internet/social media addiction!  I genuinely thought I might keep it just for that use, because waiting on pages to load would surely do it!  But it was just too annoying.The other deal breaker was battery life.  I read up on battery life before buying it, but I could not, in a week's long trial of day-to-day, normal use, get more than about 4 hours out of it before having to charge it again.  I don't do any gaming, I only very rarely watch video clips and never full videos on a device, and still I couldn't get more than 4 hours.As a READER this is a fine device - if you're buying one mostly for only that purpose, go for it.  If you're expecting it, as I sadly did, to be a serviceable replacement for a tablet, forget it.  In fact I can't believe I keep finding this LISTED as a tablet on online lists of ""Economical Tablets.""  I'm such a long-time Amazon customer and user, that this reminds me of the earliest days of Kindle's, which came packaged with something they euphemistically labeled an ""Experimental Browser,"" which meant clunky and just barely there.

I travel often in areas with poor cell service, and need to download the books to keep the narration from being interrupted.  I don't want to use my phone for books, so I purchased this small tablet  to listen to my Audible books through a bluetooth transmitter plugged into my car radio. First, when I leave the wireless connection, Alexa was notifying me was too often when there was no wireless service.  I had to disable Alexa notifications.  Second, if it is connected to wifi, I usually take several minutes to start playing the Audiobook.  So, I usually keep the device on airplane mode until I need to download another book.  Third, you would think if the device was connect to the wifi, all the updates would download overnight.  No, the last time I left it connected to the wifi, the next time I got ready to use it, it to at least 10 minutes before it was ready.  Fourth, the tablet stays in its Amazon case.  The bluetooth transmitter and the tablet connects without a problem 90% of the time.  When it is not connecting, I usually has to stop and restart the bluetooth tooth on the tablet.  What I don't understand is why must I open the tablet cover for the book to start playing after I hit play on the transmitter.

The next morning, I unplugged it, set it down, & left it for about 2 hours. I hadn't loaded any books or videos or anything yet. Came back, like I said, about 2 hours later, & battery had dropped from 100% to 81%. In 2 frickin hours with NO use. When was this piece of garbage made? 2014? So I plugged it back into the charger. I then proceeded to download all my digital purchases. Took me nearly the entire rest of the day, about 10 hours to download about 200 books, 1 because the WiFi on it is super slow, and 2, because the screen is clunky & doesn't respond very quickly. I unplugged it an hour before bed. An hour later, it had gone from 100% to 86% battery. In ONE FRIKKIN HOUR! I wasn't even using it! Next day, while I was reading on it (which is a chore, as pages are slow to flip & it often takes several 'flips' to get to the next page),  I noticed the download symbol in the upper left corner. So I swiped down on the notifications, & watched as the device, without any direction from me, downloaded video after video after video. Videos of what, you say? Who the hell knows? It just listed them in notifications as ""Amazon Video"". I couldn't even find the videos anywhere on the device. So, the ""videos"" used up ALL my internal storage, so I had to put in a 32 GB class 4 micro SD card - I tried putting in a 64 GB GB UHS 1 card, the device didn't recognize it. The device itself told me I could only put a maximum of 32 GB in the external storage, & that it had to be class 4 speed or LOWER. Again, what is this, 2014? Then ALL my books & manga disappeared off the internal storage, so I had to spend another whole day redownloading to the 32 GB card. Every time I try to use the device, I see notifications for a dozen or more ""Amazon Video"" auto downloads. I don't watch videos on Amazon. I don't watch TV or any streaming services. I read books, manga, & comics. So I have absolutely NO IDEA what these mysterious video downloads are. As for the screen resolution, it's terrible. I ended up installing the Kindle app on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8"" (2017 model) & it works perfectly. Way better resolution, and no lag. Also, no mysterious auto downloads. Also, if you want to use any apps other than the couple hundred crappy ones in the Amazon App store, you have to jailbreak the device (this part shown to me by a friend who is a software engineer, with his newly bought device, same as mine), then install like 5 or 6 apk files, then do a couple restarts, then you can actually load the Google Play Store app. You can also install other things with the ACMarket & HappyMod apps, & so on. You cannot put up widgets. You cannot play non-Amazon games (there's nowhere close to enough RAM anyways). The screen for this device doesn't have pages, it's one continuous scroll, so since there's no set dimensions, you can't load widgets of any kind. This thing has a VERY small amount of RAM, so I doubt it could even easily play videos on anything but a 4:3 ratio at VGA resolution. Don't waste your money. And don't even get me started on the literally HUNDREDS of ads I've BEEN FORCED to look at while using the device. Thanks, Amazon, real classy!","Just don't.

Once clear the app store works as it should until I access the sd files and then  it doesnt work again. What a total pain!

Amazon tablets fulfill this need above all tablet brands I have used because the layout uses larger system fonts throughout.An apparent speed increase and increased space for apps and content makes 2019's Fire 7 feel faster to boot, load apps and change screens. But to get more speed, you need to remember that a tablet with 1GB RAM like the Fire 7 runs best if you go to Settings and disable those you don't use every day. For example, in Connected Devices, I shut off Bluetooth and Print services. In Wireless, I shut off WiFi if I am not on the web.  I turn Alexa off unless I need her. I absolutely shut off Location Based Services under Security & Privacy. Under Apps & Notifications, I block all notifications. The Settings panel is rearranged under the new Fire OS, currently 6.3.1.2, based on Android 7.1.2  This new OS certainly offers many new options to Amazon app developers. However, I have found some big changes from Fire OS 5 that limit the tablet's flexibility.Like Android 7, Fire OS 6 does not offer apps the  ability to write data to your SD card, including those from Amazon. You can no longer move any apps to the SD card.  I like to move data from my computer to my tablet, but, most puzzling, Amazon Drive has disappeared from the Amazon App Store. Only Amazon Photos remains and it's for photos only. I now use Dropbox. Its method is clumsy, since you can't copy a folder. You must highlight each file to select it. Then Dropbox offers to save all  to device, and the SD card is offered here. Dropbox is the best cloud storage service offered on the Amazon App store.I use my tablet mainly for reading magazines, newspapers and books, using Audible and the Kindle apps. This tablet retains the essential feature of turning a magazine page into text where the print size can be increased and the article read aloud by Amazon's Ivona voices. No Android or Apple tablet includes such accessibility features like the Fire tablets.Now that my 2019 Fire 7 tablet is faster, has more internal storage for apps and content, and runs the new Fire 6 OS,  I am going to request the Amazon App store to specifically add @Voice, the excellent text-to-speech reader, essential for visually impaired users.  It reads web content well with the tablet's Amazon Ivona voices.I reduced my rating to 4 stars since these issues surfaced after my initial review.If you try to load the Google Play Store, be advised that Google may no longer instal  on an unauthorized device like the Fire tablet. Google denied my second attempt to do so after I reset my Fire 7. This is fair, sinceI learned that  device makers have to pay Google a license fee to use Android on their devices. I am now completely in the Amazon sphere and all is running well now....Arthur.",REVISED: Improved Speed. Great Tablet for Visually Impaired.

Sadly, it's not. I absolutely love my 10"" Fire Tablet, but this one just doesn't measure up to it or my much older seven inch tablet. The color saturation is lower, colors aren't nearly as sharp and vibrant as on the ten inch Fire tablet (or the older seven inch tablet.) The image quality is lower also. Text in particular is harder to read and seems oddly black and white mixed together and not a solid black. The build quality is lesser also and feels cheap and plasticky. I probably should have kept my old 2012 seven inch Fire tablet instead of trading it in. I'd just assumed the newer model would be an upgrade. That's how things like this typically work. Not so much this time. If you need a cheap, somewhat disposable tablet, and the color reproduction and text clarity aren't important to you, then fine, get one of these. Otherwise, I'd look for other options. There's just nothing about this tablet that's better than my old one from 2012 and much that seems to be downgraded. This was a swing and a miss to me. I'd assumed the quality would be similar to my ten inch Fire tablet and this one isn't even close. Maybe mine's a lemon, but I suspect this is the new norm for the lower end Fire tablets. My cheap smartphone has a better screen image than this tablet.Edited to add. On top of everything else, it's now dropping my wallpaper, switching apps on its own, launching apps with no input from me. Shutting down apps wile I'm trying to use them.

The latest United app cannot be downloaded on this even after installing Play Store - That's United's fault, not Amazon's so I'm not rating them based on that. Before purchasing, everyone should know this tablet does not have access to a full app store; just a limited one designed specially for this product so it isn't really a full working tablet. That is Amazon's fault.I've also had difficulty getting books to download from other websites. It seems only to accept Kindle books downloaded from Amazon and not from the library or other sites even if they are Kindle books. I have to download them to my computer and then email them to my Fire.I find the tablet a little heavy to hold for reading a book and the screen has a lot of glare.

The sound quality is poor for watching movies or tv, but certainly a much better size than my phone for that purpose. I find the tablet cumbersome to use and not at all intuitive.

I couldn't believe the price difference between the Kindle and the tablet and that the kindle was so much more $ even though the tablet could do more. So, here's the run down now that I've used my boyfriend's old black/white kindle and this tablet. I also suspect the tablet is cheaper because it is more in demand than the kindle. Overall, think about how you plan to use the device and what's most important to you in the device.Pros: versatile tablet that you can download shows (Netflix) and watch on the airplane, read ebooks, search the internet, download just about any other apps. It's very compact and I sprung for more memory (32G) and have been very happy. 7 inch screen is plenty for me to sit in the dark and enjoy a show. Not big enough for a group to watch, but plenty for 1-2 people.Cons: The biggest cons are that the screen has a lot of glare (much like a typical tablet). Additionally, it is a slow processor. I'm able to watch downloaded shows just fine, but I've not really tried actively watching over wifi all that much. I notice the slow processor when I go to open another app... I click on it and nothing happens... I wait and wait... and then something pops up. Sometimes it is super quick and other times it is sluggish. I still love the device, but it can be slow at times. I wish this had a screen more like the Kindle for reading because the glare really bothers me because I read a lot on vacation in the sun. For that reason, I sort of which I spent more for the kindle, however, I LOVE being able to download shows all in one device, so that is really NICE!!Note: you cannot listen to Google music on an Amazon device... this was a con for me since I subscribe to Google music and have downloaded playlists for the airplane.

I side loaded Google play because all the apps I had previously purchased were from the Play store, but of course Amazon and Google can't play nice, to the detriment of their customers. Within a month this tablet was shutting off sound in the middle of a movie. Doesn't matter if it's Prime movies, YouTube, whatever. The sound randomly turns itself all the way down and my son has to toggle it back up. I contacted customer support and keep being told to reset the device. Gee, thanks, I'll just reset the device multiple times a day. No problem. I've tried taking the case off the tablet, thinking that was the issue somehow. It's not. The tablet will also randomly freeze and need to be restarted. I have an extra SD memory card to take some of the strain off the device, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. The one thing I will say is that this thing is fairly indestructible with the case that I have on it. It's been dropped, thrown, stepped on, and the screen is still intact. (And btw all the other problems started before the tablet with abused....with the problems and the resulting frustration of my 6 year old most often being the reason for the abuse).

It shouldn't even be your secondary tablet. At best this could be a tertiary tablet. But at this price point, for very specific use cases, this is a recommended purchase.The first thing you need to realize is that this is a highly subsidized piece of hardware on sale for the price of a pork chop at a decent restaurant (I got it for $29 on Prime day and see it is now on sale for the same price in Septemer 2019). Do the technical specs suck?  Absolutely. Is the battery life and non-usage battery drain painful considering there is no cellular connection in the background?  Sure. Is the lack of access to Google Play Store and Amazon's overt, aggressive, and unapologetic efforts to get you to spend money in their ecosystem annoying?  Hell yes.  Does the Amazon skinned UI / UX suck donkey balls? You bet.  But even with those faults there are some redeeming qualities that make this worth $29, maybe even $39 or $49.Pros- Expandable memory as primary memory - I'm surprised this doesn't get mentioned more. The 16 gb that comes with it ends up being 10 usable, so of course I added a microsd card. I was a little surprised that the 64 gb card that I initially inserted was rejected and the tablet said I needed to use a class 10 card. Odd, since I was only planning on adding some mp4 movies and my other tablets / devices don't care about read -write speed.  So I put in a class 10 card I had lying around and configure the Storage settings. Turns out the microSD card ends up supplementing the primary 16 gb of internal storage. That is to say, most apps will install on the microSD card. Also, more importantly for me, Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon Prime movie and music download to the SD card. Let me repeat that - DRM protected content that won't download to my SD cards on my high end Samsung phone can be downloaded to my $29 tablet + $23 microSD card.  This is huge for me. I got an iPad over an Android tablet for my 10"" tablet because I wanted to watch offline content on the plane. I can now do that on my $52 cheapie tablet.Hands-free Alexa - this 2019 fire 7 has hands free alexa, which basically means I'm getting an additional echo dot that doubles as a tablet for $29. Awesome. It actually convinced me to buy the Amazon cloud can for my baby monitoring. Now when I'm home I leave my tablet plugged in on the nightstand and can say ""alexa, show me the baby"" (I named the cloud cam over the crib ""the baby"") and the screen shows me the baby. Again, for $29.  Considered getting the 8"" for show mode, but I already know all the Taylor swift lyrics by heart.I'm not going to go through all the cons I listed above and that are all over the reviews. The specs are ~2013 (MediaTek 1.3 GHz / 1 gb RAM, 600 x 1024?  yikes). But an echo dot, baby cam, bedside Kindle reader, and airplane offline movie viewing and book reading device, sure sign me up for $29.

Installed Google Play(easiest thing in the world to do) and it barely handles it. A couple apps like YouTube and some very low end games will make this tablet just about unusable. I had to delete just about everything but barebones software to get her to not spend 20 seconds loading Netflix. I caught it on sale for $30 so I really shouldn't be complaining but for those looking for a the best all around Fire this is not it. Screen is super grainy due to the low resolution and dpi but if you have little kids this will probably do. If your looking for a Fire that is super affordable and performs quite well considering, spend the extra $30 and get the 8"" Fire HD. It's much quicker and better in every way. I have Google Play Store on mine and it runs all my apps just fine. Little to no lag and the battery last twice as long as the 7"" Fire. Honestly the 7"" is really just for kids, no adult would put up with the tablets shear sluggishness and inability to do just about anything.If you have the money though the new Fire 10(9th Gen)is what you want and for the money it beats out any other tablet on the market ATM. USB-C PD 15watt charging and a quicker, snappier octa-core possessor that is incredibly efficient. Beautiful 10.1"" display in true HD.

I do own several other smartphones and tablets,etc... But this was my first fire tablet... Not knowing what to really expect from it based on the mixed reviews I have to say that for what it is it was a great purchase...  allows for the use of reading ebooks and watching videos, playing games, and lots more.... It is a good size... Not to big but still not to small. I have a larger tablet of another brand and I have to say I like my fire 7 tablet lots better... My larger tablet from another brand which cost me over twice the price of this fire 7 doesn't do half of what this fire 7 does. The fire 7 touchscreen is not always responsive to each touch quickly but it works and when watching videos they show up really well and look good.  I like reading ebooks on the fire 7 ... They show up great and I have had no trouble with any functions of my fire 7 since I received it. For the price paid it is a good value... May not be the biggest, fastest, or flashiest tablet on the market but it allows the owner the ability to have a portable entertainment center of ebooks, music, videos, games, etc... All at a reasonable price.  PLEASE NOTE: this tablet is mostly focused on Amazon products and software,etc.... ( I have no problem with that) Also allows other entertainment apps to be installed such as Hulu or Netflix.... expandable storage also.... FYI: with special offers references the showing of advertising on the lockscreen.... All in all a good value for what the fire 7 provides....",Fire 7,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: Twilight BlueStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,100,207,676588,Public

I will be giving 3 away (Sage, twilight and black) and kept 1 (black) to be used as a car video screen for baby.This tablet is perfect for what I need it for. I was able to download videos/shows from Netflix and Disney+ for Car rides. Baby is rear facing still so I purchased a Velcro tablet holder which is amazing and holds it in place when driving.  He hates getting in his car seat and gets restless during long car rides; since installing this on the headrest he hasn’t cried or whined Even when tired. He looks forward to the show and gets super excited when it starts. Very adorable and priceless for a mother that has things to do. Even with video playing he was still able to fall asleep during a long car ride.I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars only because the lock screen shows advertisements; kind of annoying and worried Baby or baby nephew (Christmas gifts) might accidentally click on ads when trying to turn on the tablet. It shows car insurance ads to game app advertisements (very colorful). Hopefully, parental controls will help. For the 1 year old he just swipes screens with his full palm so this may be an issue for him. If I had to pay full price for this tablet I would have returned it just because of these annoying ads but since they were on sale it’s hard to pass up the deal and am willing to put up with it unless it becomes a problem for the kids.The screen is a good size and light weight for toting around town. Will be used for car rides and at restaurants when kids start getting restless. Purchased durable cases for the kids and screen protectors too. A review video said his kids have had this tablet a long time without breaking it bc it’s made of plastic so that’s why I chose this vs. an iPad for the kiddos.16 GB really is not a lot of memory because once you download the main apps you use there’s not much left over for downloading content to use when off WiFi. It does come with an SD slot so may need to think about purchasing extra storage.Other than that, it has been a wonderful addition to my Chevy for entertaining baby. It’s sleek, video quality is amazing and doesn’t buffer when Driving offline. The sound is amazingly pretty good quality and loud enough even when mounted on the car headrest. no need to Bluetooth it to the car speaker or external speakers. super glad I bought this instead of having TVs installed in the car seats. This was very cost effective and you can move the tablet around or take it with you.Baby approved!UPDATE April 2020:Ads not as bad as I thought. Love the tablet more than expected since it is very light weight and durable. Everyone I gifted these to loved them and use this on an daily basis. Perfect for movies and games. also use this for home security system/watching my son play in the other room while I work from home (quarantine life).Cons:LAG-TIME!!!! Omg just to turn this thing on or switch between screens or apps takes forever and you keep retrying and eventually makes everything get all messed up or shut out!! Super frustrating would not recommend this as a work tablet, etc. too annoying. Come on Amazon! You can do better than this!!!Memory at 16gb is more like a generous 10gb which is nothing by the time you put on standard apps. Purchased a separate Samsung memory card for ~$20 (128gb) which did the trick!ABCMouse apps are limited and difficult to use these educational games for my son With his tablet due to major lag-time!!",Purchased this as car movie screen for baby!,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,101,45,478833,Public

The new On Deck system automatically downloads episodes of shows or movies I might be interested in to watch on the go when I may not have internet access, which is fantastic. The genius of On Deck is that it only uses free storage to save suggested downloads, so if I use more storage for things I download, it removes or downsizes On Deck content to free up space. The usefulness of this feature has introduced me to some new content that I'm really starting to enjoy and it's convenient to catch up on shows while working on other things as opposed to just mindlessly watching television on a couch. The Alexa integration is also very useful, especially when I'm not near an echo device.

I mean seriously. It works really well and could be sold at 3x the price for how well it works. If you have kids that want a tablet this is a good choice (don't bother with the kids version of it. This thing is tough.)Battery life is ok. It will last almost all day if you use it a lot. The older versions seemed to do this better though, with no obvious reason or improvement between the versions that justifies worse battery life.It has ads on the lock screen. Its $40. No big deal.The OS this thing runs has tons of annoying quirks. Screenshots are darker if you take them with the brightness down, for example. If you screenshot, you better turn the brightness all the way up first or the actual screenshot will be too dark. Not joking. Its annoying. Its probably a bug. They refuse to fix it.There is no way to set the time yourself. If your power goes out and your wifi box reports the wrong time to this thing (typically, it will say its midnight after power outage) you're stuck with the time wrong until it checks again, which can take all day. Hopefully it doesn't happen at night if you use this as your alarm.Icons on this thing are awful. Terrible. They are just the name of the app with the amazon smile thing under it.

When reading, there's more squinting or page-turning; when playing a game, it's just not as much fun; and when watching a video, you're missing a lot that you see on a larger screen. That said, it has a great alarm clock system and if you use it primarily for that, it's a great choice.

Plan ahead, get a great deal and enjoy this for the device it is. The Fires are absolutely great at what they are, lightweight, low-cost tablets that give you a bigger screen than your phone. They are terrible at being what they aren't. They are not several hundred dollar computer-equivalent tablets for serious work and multi-tasking. If that is what you want, plenty of top manufacturers are more than happy to take all of your money for that. That's not what I want, so that's not what I got.I like Alexa. I love Audible.

I needed a new tablet for work and could only afford this, so I am happy to have it. However, I want to let other customers know the things about the tablet i found annoying so they can if it bothers them.1. All ports and buttons (volume, power, charge, headphone jack) are on the top. In my opinion this isnt user friendly, very inconvenient and awkward to use.2. Every time you install an app (paid or free) amazon emails you about your purchase of the app. Turning off notifications for the app store does not circumvent this.3. I personally should have read more thoroughly about the ads before purchasing, but in my head it would be small ads on the Home Screen and perhaps some notifications that are ads.Please note that the ads take up the entirety of the lock screen every time you turn the screen on. I turned my tablet's screen on for the first time to a full screen of ""Game of Thrones Slot Machines!"". Wasnt expecting that...One nice thing, however is you can change the settings to recieve only kid friendly type ads, in order to avoid obnoxious or awkward ads.4. The battery seems to drain as fast as my 3 year old, broken phone (Samsung Galaxy s7) I will update this review when I have timed the battery.5. In order to use any browser other than Silk (Amazon's Browser) you have to take several steps in order to download the Google Play store and then download your prefered browser there.6. The keyboard is very clunky feeling, and inefficient. There is no spell check, no numbers on the first page of the keyboard, and you have to cycle through 2 pages of the keyboard to find symbols and specific punctuation.7. This isn't really an issue, you can change it easily, but it was really amusing to me that Amazon is avoiding usage of Google products so much, they set Bing as their default search engine on these.Overall, the tablet is decent and I actually like the interface, but there are many annoyances in my opinion. As a picky person and a usual Android user, I would not choose this tablet if I could afford otherwise had time to save up for something different.If you have circumstances like me, however, this is a fairly good tablet and you can put some work and time into making it function better for you.","Decent Tablet, but has its annoyances.",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,12,21,3079155,Public

This is a review from an exchange tablet that had several issues and I assumed I had just received a defective or damaged item.1) Battery drains from 100% to 30% within 12 minutes.2) Item advertised as offering 16GB Memory whereas only 10GB is the ACTUAL amount3) Very slow processor even after upgrading Micro sd card.4) Screen taps are unresponsive many times.5) Apps open very slow.6) Display text on screen is broken and not very appealing to look at.7) Does not detect wireless signals very well even within close range.8) Keyboard behaves very strange and inputs characters quite different than what I am typing. It is extremely frustrating.9) System does not allow user to gain moderate administrative control over much of anything without rooting device. The ability to disable or remove many unecessary apps isn't an option to the user.10) The Home Page is rather intrusive and does not allow much in the way for modifications.Overall, presently mixed feelings because my young boy will be opening this as a gift Christmas Day and possibly be bothered by some of these issues. I thought I would be getting a better tablet than the first one that I have returned for this one but I was quite bothered to find out that Amazon sent me an exchange tablet with same and more issues as the previous one. I also see Amazon has since revised the statement that reflects a charge of $10.00 more than I was offered for the Black Friday Deal, $29.00. I purchased the Spider-Man anime movie and downloaded it on this device. I am hoping this will make him happy. I don't know yet how this device does with movies yet though it boasts performance but we will see. He doesn't believe in Santa Claus so if things go south, I will be faulted here.

But, when I saw the newest version had more RAM, a better processor and was only $8/month in sale, I decided to give it another try.Build quailty: Simple, but fair. All plastic but that isn't a bad thing. Doesn't feel flimsy and actually feels like it will hold up. No glass back to break, decent weight and comes with Bluetooth AND a headphone jack!Cameras. 2mp both sides. Still absolute trash, but for $40 I couldn't hope for much. Yet, the cameras are absolutely the worst out thereDevice options: Still uses micro usb, but that isn't always bad. Glad to see they kept the SD card slot!!! Good job. Makes for an even better personal media tablet. Headphone jack a nice keep as well. Built in Mic and well.... That's it. It is a cheap tabletSoftware: Here is where they get ya. This is designed to make Amazon and Bezos money. Right off the bat Amazon tries to entrap you into paying for extra services during startup. If you are not careful you may click on one and get screwed. Then, they burden down what was once Android OS with a laborious UI that slows.the whole thing down. Each screen is designed to keep you spending money at Amazon only. Even their app store is a limited, watered down version with apps that seem 2 years out of date, and they only have a 10th of what you needThey keyboard is kind of trash as well, oddly spaced and suffering with lag. The animations only highlight how slow 1gb of ram truly is.Then there is Alexa...Their spying app is just a resource hungry analyitic collector that bogs down the device to a crawl. Seriously makes it near unusable!But, there is hope...At its core, it *is* an Android tablet. And, if you use Prime and Kindle, the reader apps are great. But you don't have to suffer with poor apps. You can get Android's Google Play store on a Kindle and it wi!I run nearly every standard app! You will have to search but it doesn't require any programming knowledge at all! In fact, 10 minutes of clicking and a reboot later, and you can have any Android app you want! I have a REAL version of MS Outlook, OneNote and even Adobe apps on mine.Speeding it up is even easier once you unlock developer mode. Once you look up how to do that you can change ALL sorts of things! By reducing or turning off on screen transition animations , forcimg 2D hardware rendering and killing off some background processes (all just simple clicks, no programming knowledge required) it will be like a different machine! No ""rooting"" required, and no warranties voided!I would disable alexa. Not only does it suck resources, but Amazon makes no secret that it records all the time and their privacy ""policy"" doesn't exist compared to Google it Apple. Just say NO to Alexa.With Google Play installed and some system tweaks, you get WAY more than $40 should get you. It is pretty durable. Battery life isn't the greatest, but not the worst. It is a pocketable size, and the Kindle app is a must for book fans. I found that, once I Put Spotify, the Real YouTube and Google Podcast apps from the Play Store and slapped in an SD card for offline storage, you have all the entertainment you need for a day! It is not an iPad and not even 1/50th what a surface is, but for $40 and an afternoon of setup you have a coo little entertainment device.For even $50, if you aren't expecting a PERFECT device, you may find it the best casual device out there.

I was wrong. This new 7 is maddening slow. It has a slow response time for most touch actions (half the time I repeat the action because I'm not sure if it registered) and downloading books from my Kindle library takes forever. I thought I'd gain speed with fewer books stored on the tablet, but that hasn't seemed to make any difference especially since waiting for the download is ridiculous. It is not related to my internet connection since my HD8 still downloads books in a split second.I have not tried adding more memory as a solution since the sluggishness was apparent right off the bat without my having downloaded any additional content, but I will try that as a possible solution.What I do like is the size, the price, and the sage color. The older Fire colors were frankly pre-school-color ugly. I am the type of person who can tune out ads and it seems the only ones I get are on the lock screen, so I'm okay with the lower price with ads trade-off.I think the Fire tablets are pretty darn amazing for the price, and I believe that you ultimately do get what you pay for.

I am getting an ipad THIS Christmas.Was it a lemon?  Maybe.  But I feel like Amazon is no longer producing quality products and standing behind them.This is the 8th kindle fire I have bought for my immediate family (more for relatives), plus a show, an echo and many dots.  I was considering purchasing dots for older family members (safety) but I think I have to break up with the Amazon products....  I have stood by Amazon (I still have my original kindle, pre-fire) and have been a prolific but trouble free (seriously) customer.  However, I am not a fool and won't keep buying kindles if they are junk and Amazon doesn't stand behind them.They DID offer me a  (small) discount to buy another fire, but why would I buy another after this disaster?  Would you?  Maybe it was a lemon, but if it was, they certainly didn't make it right.  Good luck if you decide to buy.","CAN'T TYPE, Inoperable (with light use) in less than 1 year",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,271,82,758623,Public

Others report that they managed to get it to do Text To Speech but it stops every few minutes and must be restarted.  I am not having that problem.

Price. Even though I paid a little extra to avoid Amazon's ""special offers"" (what a clever way of saying advertising) and the highest internal memory, I still ended with a tablet that does everything I wanted, and more, for less than $100 dollars. While that's not an insignificant amount of money, it was still far less than the alternatives, and frankly, I'm not going to lose sleep if I lose it or drop it or if it's stolen. I could afford a more expensive device; I just didn't need it.2. Access to my Amazon content (particularly Kindle books) and to Amazon in general. Adding a micro-SD card removed storage concerns for less than $20.3. Portability (bigger screen than my iPhone, but still small enough to hold with one hand,  tuck into a back pack or purse, car console or door pocket, etc.). I still have my original 10"" Fire tablet, but I switched to the first generation Fire 7 when it first came out for its portability and the agility to expand memory with a micro-SD card. 4. Ability to access e-mail and surf the web.I don't use this device to edit or compose documents or graphics, or otherwise perform any processor- or memory-intensive tasks; I do that on my home computer.  For the same reason, I'm not concerned about what some perceive as a lack of software or Amazon's exclusion or blockage of Google Play apps (and yes, I know that there are ways of getting around this). The capabilities of the tablet and the apps on the Amazon App Store are more than adequate for the needs I listed above.If you need an actual computer in a tablet format, than maybe you should look at the alternatives. But for a small tablet that does simple tasks well and is easy to carry, I think the Fire 7 is an amazing value. I liked it so much that I bought new Fire 7 tablets for myself and my wife, and moved my original 7 to the garage, where I can use it to play music, or refer to online help and videos for automotive and home projects.",Great value for a tablet,Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: Without AdsColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,158,193,286577,Public

My smartphone doesn’t offer a screen large enough for remotely working on the client’s network.  I needed a device that (a) is inexpensive and (b) fits into a suit coat pocket,  and (c) can remotely access a Windows domain.The Fire 7 sometimes goes on sale, but even the full retail price met my first requirement.  (As a bonus, Amazon broke the payments into 5 monthly payments, no interest).I confirmed that the device will fit into my jacket pocket (although one of the jacket pockets is small, requiring removing the case that I bought for the tablet).  Requirement #2 met.Initial setup, including attaching to my Wi-Fi network, allowing all Fire updates to install, and going through the various menus and options took about 30 minutes.  This includes moving all of the app icons on the home page that I won’t be using into a folder and setting a login PIN on the Fire.I installed Splashtop Business from the Amazon app store.  I’m able to access (and troubleshoot) the client’s remote network servers and computers.  The screen of the Fire 7 doesn’t have great resolution, but it’s larger than my  smartphone screen and works well enough for my purposes.  Final criteria met.From there:I set up a new Gmail account specifically for the Fire 7, which doesn’t mean giving access to Amazon to my corporate account.I setup an HP Envy 5000 and a Sharp 3701 printer, using the IP address of each printer.  I wouldn’t want to print out the Encyclopedia Britannica with automatic stapling and hole punching using the Fire 7, but it does simple printing.I installed Private Internet Access using the Play Store app.  No problems, seems to work O.K.Encryption of the internal storage took less than 30 minutes, and I’ve noticed no degradation of performance (YMMV).I installed an office productivity suite (not that the Kindle 7 lends itself to typing large documents or editing spreadsheets, but in a pinch it’s a good app to have available).Loading Kindle books was, of course, a snap.  Reading e-books on the Fire 7 is not as good an experience as a Kindle Paperwhite (plenty of reflections outdoors), but O.K. as a time killer while waiting for my wife to finish shopping.ORIGINAL POST: I elected to stay with the native Silk browser - I’ve seen ‘how to’ articles on installing the Chrome browser, but Chrome tends to be resource intensive and Silk will most likely do for my purposes.  EDIT: 11/2/19 I've side loaded Chrome Browser onto the Fire 7, just to make life easier; I spend considerable time in Chrome professionally and I'm finding it easier to stick with one browser.  I've noticed no significant degradation of performance.I added a micro-SD card for extra storage (having gotten the el-cheapo 16gb Fire 7).  One thing the Fire 7 is missing is a decent file explorer.  I’m still experimenting with those apps - there have been security issues with some of them.  EDIT 11/2/2019:  I've elected to use File Commander for a file explorer.Battery life isn’t great, but I only need 5-6 hours so it works for me.The Fire 7 is marketed as an “entertainment” machine; I’m not much one for watching videos on a handheld device but it can show my “Prime” movies.  The 8 or 10 inch models would be better for entertainment consumption - they have more screen room and better resolution.  As noted, I bought the 7 specifically for its size, price, and capability, and I’m using it more for productivity than for media consumption.I’m rating it at 4 stars because it’s cheap, it’s easily transportable, it can be secured, it does what I need it to do and did I mention it’s cheap?  It doesn’t come close to doing what my iPad can do - but the iPad doesn’t come close to fitting in my jacket pocket or close to matching the price of the Fire 7.EDIT 11/2/19: I've ponied up the $15 to remove the ads from the screen - I got tired of seeing them.HTHRegards,Jim",Not just for entertainment consumption.

I am right handed, so I tend to hold it in my left mostly which covers the speaker.  Again, not big a deal since I can reposition it.  But, using it with zoom, speaker location isn't condusive to camera location when typically held in left hand.Overall, I'm pleased with the device and the price is reasonable.

Since I'm recovering from surgery, I've spent a ton of time on my little Fire 7 (I got a 64g card to add to it as well). I have always used Apple products, so adjusting to the Fire was a little challenging.  After having the tablet for a little more than 3 weeks, here's the breakdown of what I like:-Great control of functions; screen brightness, bedtime color vs daylight color, I love how I can just pull the top of the screen down to get to the main settings I want-Connectivity; very functional to connect to spotty wifi and Bluetooth headphones. I paired the Amazon Basics blutetooth wireless headphones with it and after a little struggle of only connecting to one ear or the other, they worked out really well when they both paired.-Reading; I love that I can buy books directly on the Fire instead of ""purchase and send to"" from the website. I love the controls it has for the kindle, and that I can also easily get magazines or newspapers as well as graphic novels. The guided panel-by-panel reading of the graphic novels on the fire is amazing because it allows me to follow the story in the correct order so I'm not going back and re-reading. Reading regular books is also nice, but the experience is not necessarily any more astounding than on the lowest-level kindle (which I also have) except that the interface on the fire for finding your books and collections is a bit more user-friendly.-Listening; I have a large Audible library and I love that it's so easily accessible on the device to see my books and explore others as well as purchase them directly. Book sound quality is tinny just streaming from the tablet but it's not exactly designed for that, and when connecting to headphones it's great. Now that I have the fire, I feel that I'll use my prime music more; before I hardly even remembered I had it but now I'm optimistic I'll stream more music due to the ease of it being right there.-Games; I've been playing solitaire and toy blast every day for hours (recovering from surgery remember) and the graphics are good. Ads are annoying but when the tablet is in airplane mode it works out great as ads don't play but you can still play the game. I've also installed some word games that are nice and don't have any glitches either.What I don't love:-Pre-installed apps; I don't want to put my email on it, or use the camera, or use half the apps that have come with it. I'd like to remove them, at least from my screen so it's easier to find what I do use, but I have not found a user-friendly way to do that for any of them.-Battery life when wifi is on; this sucks the life down pretty quickly. I'd say I get 5 hours of use before I'm at 40% when wifi is on and I'm playing a game and listening to a book. Pretty easy solve, but I dread what streaming a show would do to the battery life.-the ads or ""special offers;"" yes I understand this is how you can get a pretty functional tablet for $30 on holiday sales, but even on airplane mode I'm getting the lock screen advertising games or dog food. It feels like a bit of an invasion of privacy.-the notifications of amazon wish list items on sale or even sales; I know an item I have on my list is on sale Amazon, but that does not mean I want to order it right now or that I actually need it. I'd like to turn off the notifications but I don't want to miss notifications of my actual orders from amazon.Now, this is clearly no iPad or even and iPhone. It's not going to blow you out of the water regarding usability, but it is a great tablet if you want basic things from it. The battery life will limit you, but on airplane mode it's much better. If I was an actual gamer, or avid TV streamer, I wouldn't look to a Kindle 7 for my needs. At the price point of a $30 dollar tablet (during sales) you really can't beat the product if you're wired in to all different elements of the Amazon empire like Kindle, Audible, Goodreads, Prime, photo storage, Music and Video. Even if you're like me and use it for maybe 4 things instead of as a replacement for a computer or something, you'll still enjoy the experience.  I stuck a mini pop socket on the back of it and holding it is even more comfortable for my smaller hands.","Nifty little budget tablet for reading, games and music",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,284,141,123133,Public

I wanted to try to play Pokemon Go and other games on it, but many of those aren't actually available in the App Store. I saw that there's ways to get it on there, but it's a lot of effort, and I can tell that it is probably too slow to run the program without a lot of glitching. Even brand new out of the box, the screen is very slow to respond to my touch. As an apple product user, I'm used to very responsive and quick touch screens. This one is a little bit excruciating to use as a tablet, so I think I will just stick to the Kindle features. Not a huge letdown since it was so stupid cheap, but would have been nice if it was more functional as a tablet. Maybe their newer, fancier, more expensive models work better.

We already have a decent-sized library of games purchased on Google's Play Store. We had no interest in rebuying our entire library in a different app store, so we side-loaded the Play Store app onto the tablet, and downloaded the games. However, apps downloaded through the store cannot be added to the Kids Mode of the tablet! I see no reason for this other than requiring parents to rebuy games on Amazon's own app store.Looked into downloading a standalone ""kids mode"" launcher app, but the main one we found had several reports that on the Fire Tablet pressing the home button would simply close the launcher. The workaround required rooting the device. That crossed the threshold for me of being beyond the effort I was willing to expend to make this tablet work.Another option might have been to investigate using something like the Nova Launcher and trying to lock down what the account was able to do. The only remaining option was to leave the tablet in adult mode, giving our kid unfettered access to anything on the device, including full access to any Amazon Prime Video movies and recommendations for things (like teen/adult-targeted comic books based on my history of reading Star Wars comics) that I don't necessarily want him accessing at his age.In the end, it was too much effort to make this cheap tablet work.In addition, the cheap off-brand case we got was poorly designed, with the speaker holes redirected down into a 90-degree bend and out the back of the device instead of up towards the user (they should've flipped the main body of the case 180-degrees... how hard is this??), leaving the sound muffled and hard to hear.While we got the tablet on sale, by the time we paired it with the name-brand case, it would've only been another $10 to get the kids bundle, which included the case, a 2-year no-questions warranty, and a free year of their kids app/book subscription service. A no-brainer!But then the Samsung Tab A 8.0 was on sale for only about $35 more, and included a bigger, better screen, a case (that, to be fair, from reviews I'd seen, would probably need to be replaced), better processor/gpu and memory (important as the kid gets older and plays more advanced games), double the on-board storage, a much better battery, and a kids mode that we already had experience with from another tablet and that includes the ability to add all our existing Play Store apps. We decided that was probably a no-brainer.We returned the Amazon tablet, and are still currently using our older 10-inch Samsung tablet with only 16gb of storage that was a hand-me-down from a grandparent. Will probably go the route of the Tab A 8.0 when we feel a stronger need to upgrade.",Kids Mode Can't Use Play Store Apps, Samsung made more sense,Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: Twilight BlueStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,53,56,1042210,Public

The Fire HD7 also requires more frequent recharging, just about every other day as opposed to a week for the Kindle.  It also does not automatically open to the most recent page read, instead it displays an ad screen.  A swipe up will bring you to the menu screen.  I think the best way to use the Fire HD7 is to click on  For You  on the menu bar.This will display your most recent book as well as the previous 2 or 3.  It also displays the current outside temperature, and just below that your Watch List on Amazon Prime.  Unlike the Kindle, you can watch movies on the Fire.  I don’t.  If I’m going to watch a movie, I prefer a larger screen.At home that means my TV, on the road it’s my laptop PC.  One last difference.  The Kindle displays a yellow light while recharging, a green light when fully recharged.  The Fire has no such indicator, but it does display a progress bar at the top of the screen.  All that said, I still prefer the Fire HD7.  Book covers display in color, as do the Collections, which is a nice reminder of what books I have downloaded.  The collections screen could use some improvement.  The collection name is displayed in bright orange against a white background, which makes it difficult to read.  Not sure why Amazon went with a font like that.

So 3 average.  If you don't side load the Google Play store, I don't know what you would do with this thing unless give it to your kid. Yes one of my primary uses for a mobile device is as a Kindle - but I have a Kindle, an iPhone and an iPod for that. I have Fire Tv for TV. What would I do with this without Google Play?  (Oh, but still not all apps work, like 23andme.)  I got it to replace my dying iPod touch, so if Amazon ever seriously blocks Google Play, I want a refund.As a cheap way to get into Android, I'm glad I tried this when it went on sale on Prime Day, but only because of Nova Launcher. If Amazon successfully blocked it, again, this would be useless. Using side-loaded apps with Amazon's native launcher is the laggiest thing that ever lagged.  (Also, does anyone know how to fix the terrible autocorrect?  Duck I thought Apple's was bad.)Aside from the lagging (omg the lagging), the touch screen and keyboard in the native launcher are terrible.  I actually liked the way Amazon's is set up, but it was so rough, and slowwwww, especially compared to the ease of an iPhone.  Nova Launcher is the only thing that fixed this for me, even for Amazon App store apps, making the whole thing run much more smoothly. I'm still not crazy about the touch screen, but it's no longer aggravatingly frustrating.One thing that is incredibly frustrating is that push notifications are not reliably working for any apps - from the Play store or Amazon app store. I think I can fix it, but this thing is a lot of work. A lot a lot.Night mode/blue shade washes the screen out, but for reading it's fine. Regular mode looks nice to me (unless you're in a side-loaded app on Amazon's launcher - then it's wonky).It's fine as an iPod replacement, especially as it takes a microSD (one of the biggest pluses other than price), but overall I'm not impressed. I thought about getting one for my young kid, but I'm not gonna bother. He watches his Prime shows in the FireTV , so I don't see much use for this, at least until his iPad mini stops working. As much as I hate to say this, I'm sticking with Apple for my main mobile devices - as they stick it to me with their OS updates that purposely brick your device. I wish there were mid-price Android options that would compel me to switch.",Not useable out of the box without side loading,Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: Without AdsColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,166,64,597323,Public

I am a supporter of the android/google ecosystem though so my expectations and opinions admittedly skew towards that experience.1. This is slow.  I've used 1st gen mini ipads that no longer support most of the current software, and it still feels smoother and lot more responsive than this Fire7 running an app.  It's already leaning towards a no-recommend unless you're strictly using this for reading, Amazon shopping, and Alexa-integration.2. Battery life seems pretty weak.  After struggling to work a few hours to download and work Skype, Google Sheets, and couple other cloud-cooperative productivity software, I was down to emergency plug-in.3. Skype, and I assume other apps, were not providing notification flashes as they arrived.  Nor do they provide badge counts on the icons.  After prolonged testing, I also realized Skype would not run in the background to the point it would receive messages until I loaded the app up.  What good is that???4. Google sheets, is stuck on the main page, when you try to tap on sheets, it just returns to this screen.  I cannot connect from a webpage, which usually prompts to edit using the Google Sheets App.  Nor could I open spreadsheets from Google Drive.  Hoping to use this as a mobile device at work around the warehouse makes this a feeble attempt.  I later side loaded Google Play and it's services just to run google sheets.  Now that it works, it's still slow to run, it does not seem to run multiple apps, or keep Skype running in the background to receive up-to-date messages between colleagues.  This also leads to a headache of figuring out how to remove initial google accounts so that I can distribute them out to workers.  THAT doesn't work, I had to remove the device from my google device ON ANOTHER machine in order to remove non-password access to my google account.5. The Amazon launcher itself is an issue to laugh at.  This is an endless barrage of lures to use, buy, subscribe to Amazon products.  Although this is a hack of android's system, it intentionally tries very hard to grant any useful access to Google productivity features.  It's an endless sea of book, video, product recommendations which likely are curated by it's hard-working engineers that studiously watch every move their users do to give them, ""A simple Amazon experience"".6. When I tried to use account permissions, eg. for kids and family members, I tried using this feature to lock out colleagues from basic amazon and google accounts used to set up productivity.  Nope, this does not work well at all.  If you grant some content, it's not app-related but the user gets suggestions of 'appropriate' videos, articles, or other consumption-based material.  If you grant  just the apps you want available, the user was presented with downloadable ""something"" of the 2 apps.  When I tried it, the apps did not load after downloading, and they show up in weird dynamic categories like:  allowed, or suggested, or recent.7. Overall, many people will find pluses if they are heavily invested in a certain ecosystem (Amazon, Apple, Samsung, Google, etc.)  If anyone plans to invest in a tablet with some freedom, I highly suggest saving a few bucks and go with an Android tablet.  If you want smoother integration into a fine-tuned tightly-regulated ecosystem, Apple shines above Amazon's.  If you are heavy user of Alexa, shop only on Amazon, and big-time 'consumer' of media, this could be seen as a great 1 or 2-year buy.  I do shop heavily on Amazon, however that alone is not enough to feel comfortable using this as a productivity tool day-to-day.",Maybe I'm expecting too much?,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,20,33,1483132,Public

I have an 8-inch Samsung, and it’s just too danged big.So, the Amazon Fire 7. I got the 32GB model for $69.99.I kept it a couple of weeks and returned it, details below.Pros:1. Good build quality.2. Tight integration with the Amazoniverse for shopping, ebooks, video, music and all the rest.Cons:1. Very weak app store. Some of my favorites, like SmartNews, Gmail, and MyFitnessPal, weren’t available, and similar products just didn’t make the grade. It does have Words With Friends, but despite an hour or two of fiddling, I absolutely not get it to sign in and sync up with the Words With Friends games, opponents, etc, on my phone and other tablets. Maybe there’s a way, but it’s just too much trouble. WWF should be easy fun, not a configuration marathon.2. Poorly organized interface with too few configuration options. Rather than a home screen with your favorite apps and a separate interface with all apps organized alphabetically, you basically just get one long vertical scroll with all your apps on it. If you can’t find the one you want, you just have to use the search tool.3. *Too* tightly integrated with the Amazoniverse. At times, it behaves for more like an unabashed marketing platform than anything resembling a general-purpose tablet.I'm giving it 3 stars because the hardware was a 4 or 5, but the functionality was only a 1 or 2.Sorry, Jeff Bezos.

The camera is only 2 mp, and didn't have the resolution to read may barcodes - it is definitely an afterthought. I tried to run Android apps and they often won't run without problems; the Amazon app store is very limited. Then I found out how to install Google Play on the Fire and it is a whole new creature - Android apps seem to run just fine.

Everyone said it's soo much better than a FIRE tablet. I wasn't impressed by a paperwhite.  Claims of a battery life that lasts WEEKS!!! Nope. That is if you set screen brightness to low (which I set at 10 out of 24). And WEEKS of battery life is if you only read 30 minutes a day MAXIMUM.  Yeah, I routinely read 1 or 2 books A WEEK. At the end of the day, my FIRE tablets (I own 4 of different sizes & generations), I routinely have approximately 49% battery life... at the end of the day. Sometimes it gets down to 35% and I'm still reading - but I can plug it in easily and keep reading. The paperwhite has the micro usb port on the bottom of the unit - making it difficult to charge & read at rhe same time... plus you get to damage your cables by bending them when you get tired and try to prop the thing on a table or pillow.My favorite thing about my Fire tablet... I can download Libby or Overdrive from the app store and then check out books from my library for FREE. There I can download books in Kindle format, PDF, EPUB & MP3 Audiobooks... and through the library app they all function seamlessly.  You cannot get all those formats on a regular Amazon e-reader without doing several extra steps.You can also download apps, games, music, access the internet via wifi... and expand the downloadable memory with a micro sd card.  I can't recommend a Fire tablet enough. This particular purchase was for a friend who has never had a tablet before.

It is an original Fire that I bought when they first came out. It has subjected me to more frustration than any high-tech device in a long time. But the good news is that I have limited sight, my Kindles ability to change font size and screen brightness are a godsend.Here are some problems.1. There are two notations for changing font size. One is in CONTROLS, a horizontal orange line with a white dot that can be used to adjust the size. The other is a double box, accessed through the book readerm with + and - in it. An adjacent orange line controls brightness.On the latter screen, I mistakenly touched the left end of the brightness  control orange line, and the screen went black. A black touch screen is a big problem. Ultimately I went into a walk-in closet, and after I became dark-adapted, could make out just enough to raise the screen brightness to a useable level. I consider this a design defect - a user should never be without a way to find the needed touch-sensitive area.2. A Kindle may have a number different capabilities, but the designers should never, in their search for incremental elegance, loose sight of the fact that its prime function is TO BE A BOOK READER. I recently wanted to retrieve a book from my library, and after considerable swiping, tapping, poking, and prodding found the book, and downloaded it. I then worked some more to get the book in the local library, with the full-screen icon displayed. I never did get the book to open, until I shut the Kindle down and restarted it.4. I do a lot of highlighting and bookmarking,My old Fire is great for this, but the Fire 7 makes way too many unwanted page changes3. The devices too many modes, and too many different ways to move between them. To put it into engineering terms, this is a state machine with too many states, each state has access to too many other states, and the state transition triggers are inconsistent.I never play games, watch movies, or listen to music, It is OK to have them available, but they shouldn't get in the way of reading books with a barrage of spam-like suggestions. And I really dislike having to swipe up eat gaudy opening scvreen.This is a fine tool - once you figure how to navigate this overly-complex interface. After a number of hours use I am starting to get it. But I still find myself going back to my old Fire when I am in a hurry.","Great Product, User Interface Complex and confusing  at first",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: PlumStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,256,47,1462332,Public

The 7"" is incrementally larger (circa 1/2"" taller) but a tad lighter at 10.5 oz.  Because it is more streamlined and thinner it ""feels"" an ounce or two lighter, although it isn't.  The new Fire 7"" is definitely faster and has a better touch screen.  I am sure I will be using it more than I used the 6"".This is an inexpensive item so any criticisms need to be viewed in that light - whatever the criticism, it's good for the price and 10-20% the price of a mini iPad.SOFTWARE. ""WALLED GARDEN.""  I was trying to replicate the software apps I used on my iPhone, with a number of problems.  While Evernote, Dropbox, Washington Post and WSJ were available, and of course Netflix and HBO, other apps I use were not.  The Amazon App store is limited.  See next section.SIDE LOAD APPS.  ""SIDE LOAD IN BRIEF.""  There is a procedure I had forgotten that you can fairly easily side load some Android apps that are not inside the Amazon Fire App store.  For me, these are all functional apps (not games).  You go to Settings/Security, and say YES to Apps from Unknown Sources.  Then you go to a p k mirror dot com (lots of online articles point to this).  You search for the app you want, download it, and answer a few fine print Fire questions like ""Download?""  ""Open?""  ""Install?""  Then the app shows up like a native app on the Fire home screen.  There is also some way to install Google Play Store on a Fire, which I haven't done.  Apps like  New York Times, Flipboard, and Feedly that I use literally all the time, had to be side loaded this way.  Other apps like Trello generated error messages on Kindle.  Feedly installed but would NOT accept my logon via Google account, the only way I can get into it.  Net net, there are some applications like this I couldn't replicate on Fire as on my iPhone.  Also I use ONENOTE on ipad and iphone but not Fire.  I had to use a different podcast app on Fire than on my iPhone (podcast addict).  Remember that for some things with no Fire app you can resort to the browser and a bookmark (e.g. Trello).  (In addition to the method cited here, there is some way to install the actual Google Play Store, see online articles and training videos).MEMORY CARD.  It REJECTED a micro SDHC card I'd been using in my Windows laptop.  I got a new micro SDHC card and it recognized it out of the box, but asked me with a popup dialog if I wanted to (A) specially format it for Fire use only, or (B) use it as a transfer card.  This new card generated an error warning in my Windows 10 laptop, but it worked OK anyway.  I transferred ten H264 movies and Fire read them fine.  I accessed them with a free Fire app store app, File Commander.  I understand you can also access memory card movies via (A) Video > Options > Personal Videos (sometimes I can't find this path) or (B) via an app called My Videos.  File Commander is easiest.SCREEN.  ""DECENT.""  it's good, but for the two digit price don't expect a retina screen like on some $500 tablet.  It's fine for me for video, some fine print apps like Washington Post text looked distinctly grainy though.  It makes a good eReader; weighing 10.5 oz versus my Paperwhite 7 oz.INITIATING.  ""FROZE!!""  A ""D"" for the out of box experience.  After several initiation steps, finding wifi, and downloaded an update, my Fire froze in ""JUST A SEC"" mode for over an hour.  This is common (see Google); you have to hold down the power button for 30 sec for a reboot.  On rebooting, I got the JUST A SEC screen a few times, but only for a few seconds.SUMMARY.

Amazon tried to contact me by email, voicemail and phone because they wanted to resolve this issue.  That's a good thing, right?No.  I have needed to explain the same problem each time to a different person and the last person told me that it is not possible to change Alexa accent to something different but still have Alexa do the things it should.  I already knew that, so why call me to tell me that the Alexa programming is faulty when I already know that.  Amazon says my ""feedback is helping us build Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company"".  I don't think it is.To make it worse, one of my gripes was how the Fire Tablet does not recognize Hawaii as being part of the USA.  They called me at 10 am California time without realizing that in Hawaii, that is around dawn.  Not considerate and it kinda proves my point.  They did not read my review and made the same systematic mistake.If you live in the USA and you want Alexa to speak a different language, it is not possible.  The program will speak in a different language but then most skills and apps stop working.  Lucky for me, I just wanted to hear Alexa with an Aussie accent.  Imagine if I lived in the USA but only spoke Spanish or German?  Then, Alexa would be completely useless, even though the capability is there.  Very lazy programming by Amazon developers.original review below:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I went on a little buying spree on Prime day, figuring it was a good time to start building a home automation system.  After some thought, I went with Alexa over Google.  Don't know why, but now I know more, that might have been a mistake.With Google products, one tends to expect hardware and apps that have had a bit more thought built-in than competing products.  So it is a real shame that I discover Amazon products are not designed the same way.  I would think that for Amazon, the idea was to hook people in with a great home automation assistant and to make sure it was at least as good as the closest rival. Then trap them into a cosy buying feedback loop.  Not so - Amazon have settled into the benthos of mediocracy.  Some aspects are really good but it has so many basic flaws.  The problems seem to come from the tablet but mostly it is Alexa.  For example, If I were British and living in the USA, I might I might prefer Alexa with a British accent, and I do.  Americans might also like to try a different accent  BUT YOU CAN""T.  Alexa is able to speak with a British accent, but only if I go and live there.  If I change the accent, my permissions, apps, and what I can access will change.  I will not, for example, be able to do any banking and about half the apps I have do not function as they should.  Why?  I imagine it is a shortcut in the code - linking the accent as well as the source country with app permissions set by location.  If thats the case, why is it not carried through to ALL apps and features?  Amazon store still defaults to the USA as does search engines and everything else...  Just very poor product development and lazy people not checking things.  Thank goodness they don't build aircraft.While on the whole location thing.  The tablet does not automatically set the date time and time zone.  Why?  Someone forgot that Hawaii is a US state.  The bottom right hand star on our flag is us; and the star is as large as all the others.  The ""system"" defaults to California (3,000 miles away).  I had to manually scroll through to choose location (Hawaii is located in the Pacific so again the app. permissions are probably different.  Then you need to scroll through the 48 different world time zones to find Hawaii.  What a stupid design.  Anyway, if someone wants a couple of Alexa tablets and 2 echo shows, you will find them in the trash outside my house.",Alexa?  get your act together!,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,340,98,180896,Public

For $30, during Prime Day for me (or during Black Friday or Christmas), this is a really good tablet for that price.For the tech-savvy, I would not recommend this. 1 GB of RAM is still not enough for any current day device (maybe besides Vanilla Linux), let alone Android. The 16 GB ROM is a welcomed addition (though only 10 GB is usable to the end-user). This tablet is definitely not for gaming. Minecraft is barely passable, running on the Automatic Low-Memory-Graphics setting. HOWEVER, the UI (Fire OS) is not as choppy as I thought it would with the internals. Some things do take some time to load, but overall performance is good enough. Nonetheless, I personally do not like the Fire OS skin.Also, the 800p/720p screen is good for general use. And the Dual Band WiFi is much appreciated. This, in my experience, is best used as a media device, which I think is what Amazon intends for this device. Otherwise, I'd pick something else with a better screen, internals, and UI.If you are tech-savvy, you can definitely port over Google Play Service and the Play Store for better usability. It's a pretty easy one-time process and you can download a legit copy of YouTube and regain some extra usability after that.Suggestions:Amazon could literally increase the budget for these tablets by porting over VANILLA Android, which is open-source and would be more beneficial to the user and Amazon as it decreases development costs. Fire OS (still Android) has very limited capabilities because of the UI skin. The addition of Vanilla Android can not only offer more capabilities, but it can also increase price margins for better internals and better performance, leading to better user experience. However, knowing Amazon, this is going to be a stretch. I can get the purpose of Fire OS. It's simple and intuitive, but it is very limiting for my taste. I cannot justify buying Amazon's bigger and better tablets.Overall, this is a good tablet for the price. However, Amazon could make this SOOO much better and more capable. I can definitely recommend this to a certain group of people, like kids or people who would like to use it as a secondary device. Otherwise, other people should carefully consider this tablet and their options. For me, it met my needs as a secondary device, but it's definitely not going to meet my needs for college, for example. This tablet is not for everyone.Sidenote: I love the Twilight Blue Color for this tablet. This definitely added some flare to my stash of black stuff XD",Good secondary device.

If you've used iOS or iPadOS, you will immediately see that Android is much worse.  But if you're okay with that, great.The next is that it's not even set up as a general-purpose Android device.  You can install apps from the play store, but it's a big hassle, and most of the documentation on how to do it online is WAY out of date.  So be prepared to waste a lot of time, if that's your goal.  (Actually, if your Google search includes the version of Android this is running, maybe it won't waste too much time.)  If all you want to do is use it as a Kindle, it'll be easy to use, and you'll be all set.Lastly in software, you're going to have to put up with ads on your screen unless you want to pay extra to remove them.  If you're okay with this, excellent, as it won't be a detraction for you.Now let's look at the hardware.Next is the screen.  If you've used Retina displays on Apple devices, you will not be impressed, but if your expectations are low, it'll be just fine.  Maybe even great.  And if you've used black & white Kindles, you also won't be impressed.  This adds color, of course, but for many books that is not any advantage.Lastly the battery: it sucks.  This is my second one of these devices, actually, because my family members used the first one and didn't bother keeping it recharged, and the battery lost its ability to hold a charge.  With my new one, I'm using it for myself and making sure it gets charged regularly, but when I unplug it I notice that the battery goes down quickly.  It really has the worst battery life of any device I can think of that I've ever used.If you're okay with all these downsides, buy it!  I got it REALLY cheap on Prime Day.  It was so cheap it was almost free!

After having this new Fire 7 (9th Gen.) for a week now and have been using it every day for long periods of time, I've made a few comparisons between them.Let me compare the specs.  I will refer to my old Fire HD 6 (4th Gen) as my Old 6"", and my Fire 7 (9th Gen.) (this product) as the New 7"".Screen size:Of course, the Old 6"" one has a smaller screen at 6"", and the New 7"" is 7"".Winner:  Even though the New 7"" has a larger screen size, I'm actually on the fence about this one because are some advantages to having a smaller tablet to carry around.Resolution:Old 6"" is in HD with 1280x800, 252 ppi.New 7"" is SD at 1024x800 with 171 ppiWinner:  Old 6""Processor:Old 6"" has Quad-Core 2@1.5 GHz + 1.2 GHzNew 7"" has Quad-Core 1.3 GHzWinner:  New 7"", although I honestly don't know anything about those numbers, but I do know that the new one is faster than my old one.Camera:Old 6"" has VGA front facing, 2 MP rear facing cameras, and video 1080p@30fpsNew 7"" has 2 MP front facing and 2 MP rear facing camera, and HD video recording at 720pWinner:  New 7""Battery Life:Old 6"" has up to 8 hoursNew 7"" has up to 7 hoursWinner:  Old 6""WiFi:Old 6"" is 802.11 b/g/nNew 7"" is Dual BandWinner:  New 7""So looking it over, it looks like the new 7"" is the winner between them, but I am debating over whether to keep it.  I prefer a longer battery life and HD resolution which the old 6"" has.  Sure, there are many benefits to the new 7"" over the old one, but not every benefit carries the same weight to me.  Everyone has their own preferences.  However, I got the new 7"" at a good price and I can pay in installments, so I guess I'll keep it.  But I will still use the old 6"" periodically, like when I want to carry it in my purse.  (The smaller size is actually an advantage over the new one in this instance.  Another advantage is that I can use it for longer periods of time and will appreciate that extra battery life.)The one thing I'd like to stress is that there are features that they used to put on the smaller, less expensive models that now you have to upgrade to an 8"" to get them (such as HD and longer battery life).  I own an 8"" (7th Gen.) that I bought a couple of years ago, and although it does have those features, it's very buggy and you have to reboot several times a day.  They're not making them as well as they used to, for some reason.My main point is that if you have an older working model, you may want to consider holding onto it, and you'll have to decide for yourself which benefits outweigh each other.","Better than my old 6"" one (on paper)",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,112,33,5326924,Public

These devices respond well to a USB mouse (with adapter) and bluetooth keyboards.  I've been extremely happy with sitting in a coffee shop, with a small table, and having a compact setup for checking and responding to emails and other tasks.  The 7 has a screen that is a bit too small for anything productive, but is excellent for surfing the web, watching YouTube, reading Kindle, and the like.  Both the 8 and 7 are EXTREMELY durable, meaning that I don't have to carry them around in an extra sleeve, and they are more less, like a big phone that I can put on my kitchen table and leave it, without having to close it up or worry about it getting damaged.  This is great for quickly accessing information.  As a person who does not want to spend a lot of money on android tablets, I believe both the HD 8 and the New 7 are WONDERFUL products for the money.  The 7 is SLIGHTLY slower than the 8, but the difference is nominal.  Also, I would encourage new users to check for updates frequently when first getting the device and setting it up, because after about 12 updates the speed and performance improved rapidly...Fire OS does not have a reminder system similar to Windows that lets you know an update is pending.  I am very pleased with both my HD 8 and this New 7 for travel and for light productivity work in situations where taking a laptop or chromebook is not a good idea, especially when on vacation and working outside (like at the beach).  The screen is bright enough that I could use both at the beach, while under a pavilion, and get work done (for those of us who need to be tethered to work when even on vacation!).

Apple tablets are just way overpriced and expensive, and regular Android tablets are starting to become harder to find. So, when the Fire 7 went on sale for the holidays for just $29 I said why not? It is a very simple device so do not expect premium performance. There is a very noticeable lag when starting apps and pulling up menus. The OS, which is Android based, is fairly intuitive. The app selection from the store is lacking, but I was surprised at some of the apps that were available.  Even though the OS is Android based, you can only use apps specifically for Fire tablets instead of the whole gamut of Google apps for Android. But I was able to find nearly all the apps, or at least versions of them, for what I wanted on my tablet to control my smart home devices, keep track of news, email and social media, play music through bluetooth, and a few other oddball apps I like to use. This device is also my introduction to Alexa. I have been weighing either integrating my house with Google or Alexa. My mind is still not made up on which direction I want to take on that, but I figure the Fire 7 was worth it with all the integration features of Alexa in a tablet which I also had a need for.

I ordered it as a cheap backup to my work tablet and because I love the 7 inch size.  The Fire 7 has been a mixed bag, but with some adjustments, I would order one again.The first thing I will say is I ordered the no-ad version.  Not worth it at all.  However, order the most memory you can possibly afford!  The 8 gigs on this device is barely adequate and I had to factory reset it last month because it had become almost unusable.Secondly, forget apps.  They won't work.  Trust me.  Games kinda work, but some features will not.  News apps do not work at all.On the other hand, it runs Amazon apps and media well.  No problem with video or books.  Also the Silk browser works very well and I do a lot of net surfing on this tablet.The reset bought me several more months but I will probably replace it around Christmas.  I love 7 inch and feel the 8 inch is still a little big.  However, I may upgrade to the 8 just to see if the experience is any better.  Either way, I am buying the larges internal memory they offer.Like I said a mixed bag.  For browsing, reading, and video watching, this tablet is excellent for the money.  For apps, games or anything large, forget it.  Too few things work with the 32G SD card as well.****I will probably buy the newer version later this year, if I do I WILL GET THE LARGEST MEMORY AVAILABLE!!!***",Good as long as you understand what you are buying.,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,149,96,1596321,Public

I also find that the books i'm interested in are so expensive to purchase for Kindle.Why would I pay over $10 for the Kindle version of a book when I can just get the actual book used and in good condition for $3.00?! It's disappointing that after purchasing this tablet and anticipating using the Kindle part of it, that i've already bought 3 books off e bay for 3 bucks each where they were going for over 10 dollars here at Amazon for Kindle.When Amazon brings their prices down for Kindle book purchases, i'll start using it.

I was offered a trade in, plus $20 credit, so, $30 for my old one.  So I took it.  I must say, I was surprised. The new Fire has a better sounding speaker, better screen, and battery.  It is also faster.  I never realized how much the old Fire lagged.  The onboard typing board is better also.  Downloading my apps and settings, books, movies, etc was seamless.

It will fit handily in bags as well as in my hand when using, and it is easier reading on this than my iPod. And it’s more versatile than a hard copy book. Some places I have WiFi access, so can go online too.That being said, there are some things that my Apple stuff is better for. There is no version of Garmin connect for this, and I used a Garmin for cycling. May not be an issue for you. I haven’t been able to get the Kindle set up to get my Mac.com email. Not sure if that’s because I’m not doing it right or if the Kindle email app isn’t compatible with Mac.com. The sound quality of the built in speaker isn’t great.

The image on the screen is good, and brightness is good, so it's a shame it doesn't support the ambient Display setting.

I use this tablet daily.  Yes, every single day.First the good. I still love this little tablet.  I do NOT use it for anything other than entertainment,  email etc. I have an ipad and laptop for work, school etc.  For the most part I don't leave the house too often without it. I've had a couple of issues that arent a big deal for me but may be for you.Battery life. It could definitely be better. I've used the tablet for several hours straight only a couple of times but I did need to charge it in the car while I was out.If your wifi is at all sketchy, expect lag. On a strong signal there hasn't been any problem. At least with my unit.Reading, I read a lot. No, seriously 2 or 3 books a week. Not those little 400 page ones either. I carry my old faithful kindle touch to read during the day. I began having trouble with eyestrain reading on the tablet. So while you can absolutely read on this tablet, which I do at night, just be aware.Games, Amazon needs to SERIOUSLY step up their game in this department.  I've been mildly irritated a couple of times after porting games by the lack of support from dev's. for the Amazon platform. Did I cave and install google play. Yes I did. YouTube is your friend. However, there have been a couple of issues even with that and game crashes have been an issue. So, I stopped playing them. Too much hassle.In summary,  for what I use it for, this tablet has been great and I will continue to use it as long as it lasts. The size and weight are fantastic.  Keeping my review at 5 stars because the issues that have come up weren't a deal breaker for me. I'm definitely getting my money's worth.This little tablet was a great investment for me. I can carry this with my phone for short jaunts out around town and be able to do almost everything  I need to do on a device. It has NOT of course replaced my laptop, nor has it replaced my larger iPad. Those are for work. This is for entertainment.I read a lot. I still have my 4gen touch kindle that I will use until it dies, and for long reading sessions at home that's what I use. For shorter reading or perusing magazines or comics I use this. In the event that I'm waiting for a notification and decide to read or check email, this is a handy thing to have in my bag.Let's talk about my bag, it is now LIGHTER. Ladies did you read that? With this I can carry something smaller than a diaper bag. (Gasp) or a briefcase, whichever.I've watched a few shows on the tablet. I personally didn't have any issues. They looked good and I used headphones so I didn't worry about sound.Alexa of course is handy and the fire tablet synced right up with our echo dots. No problems there.I can go on and on. I really like it. I also bought one for my 17 year old boy and HE even loves his. Finally got that kid to start reading more.

Why would they list the claim that Spectrum works with this???Finally, the battery drains even when you aren't using it because of the built in ads. I leave it unplugged on my bed at 75% when I leave for work and when I get home 10 hours later (and no one is in the apartment that could even be using it), then the battery can end up at 25-50% that night.

It performs as I would expect an e-reader to do, for the most part, and it was very inexpensive for the sale price - which was awesome.I bought the version ‘without special offers,’ and I was a bit surprised (though I guess i shouldn’t have been) that you have to pay extra to not have constant ads on the device. Even without the special offers, I don’t love all the promotional/ad-like content that bombards each screen - especially if connected to WiFi. I just want to see the books & apps I buy, and nothing else.The touchscreen is a little finicky at the top where you have to slide down to access the control panel. Also, it seems like the battery drains rather quickly for an e-reader. I can still read for several hours, so it’s not a huge problem, but I would expect the battery to last longer if I have the WiFi off and low power mode on. The backing also seems less sturdy than my 1st gen (that thing took a lot of falls and was pretty indestructible) but so many older tablets/phones were sturdier then their newer versions.Overall, I’m still satisfied with the purchase, bc I was just looking for a way to continue reading e-books, but some of the finer details leave a little to be desired.",Pretty Good,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Without AdsColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,9,49,3666016,Public

What a big disappointment! While the apps now work again on this upgraded model, the things I love about the original are gone, such as the carousel and the bookshelf. The opening screen is ALWAYS some sort of advertising! And the whole experience is a push of advertising all the time, interrupting the flow of whatever we are trying to do. Why pay my money to buy a device so that it can push advertising at me all the time? Seems like what I paid for was to get ads shoved at me rather than, as with the original, paying for a device to read books, look things up, install apps to use, educational experiences. Almost all the tech devices are now just glorified gadgets for pushing advertising, from Kindles to smart phones to whatever. Sad.

I'd agree with other reviewers the previous Fire 7 5th & 6th gen were slow to the point of just being better as an ebook/newspaper/magazine reader and Prime Videos/Netflix tablet. This generation base model specs are a huge improvement as its faster with more storage, however the battery life leaves a bit to desire as the up to 7 hrs seems to be based on reading an eBook with brightness lowered or listening to your Amazon music library using the SDXC slot storage.  If you're going to use it for streaming such as Amazon Prime Video, SlingTV, Netflix, etc the battery life will be closer to 4-5 hrs depending upon brightness and audio streaming such as Tune-In, Pandora or iHeart Radio should average 5.5 hrs with minimal brightness.As far as the complaints of battery life when not in use, if you turn off the wifi & bluetooth via airplane mode the battery shouldn't drop more than 1% per day idle.  With the ad-supported models there is always the possibility it grabs more ads each day while wifi is on. Also if I recall Amazon Prime Videos auto-downloads a free episode of their ""promoted shows"" unless you disable it and that is known to drain any Kindle Fire battery.Pros:-Faster CPU: Everything is faster from general UI swipe between screens and application launches.-Storage: More storage compared to the previous gen and faster when applications are downloaded then installed.-Screen quality is brighter and crisper for text compared to my 5th gen Fire 7.-Touch screen sensitivity is extremely great compared to past Fire 7 models if you go as far back as the first Kindle Fire, in the past the gap between the screen and digitizer would result in some weird multi-touch dead-zones near the edges of the screen.-SDXC slot can use faster U3 cards so if you run applications off the card it'll be almost as fast as using onboard tablet storage.-FireOS: Its equally fast like the 8th gen Kindle 8, however with 1GB of memory if you start multi-tasking it'll start to slow down a bit.-Alexa: While I never used it, the function is useful if you need hands-free usage while using it.-Amazon finally put the speaker on the edge of the tablet which improves sound when standing up in a case and you don't need to crank up the volume compared to the 5th gen rear speaker.Cons:-Volume button placement makes it easy to accidentally lower the volume while holding it, the recessed buttons make it less common than the 5th/6th gen Fire 7.From owning a 7th and 8th gen Kindle Fire 8 the memory difference matters if you multitask applications or play a few demanding games.  In my opinion the Kindle Fire 8 is a far better value as you gain stereo speakers for moments you don't want to wear headphones and the battery run time with media playback is much better.  If anyone has pets, this Kindle 7 is durable enough for allowing a cat to play games on it or watch Netflix so you shouldn't need to spend extra for a Kids edition for a pet entertainment device.",Entry Fire tablet worth recommending,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,82,24,31122099,Public

I would usually read on my phone and that was a strain on my eyes. This is larger than my phone but small enough for me to still like.

You can change font, color, and brightness to aid or enhance your experiences. However, this tablet is far from perfect. The battery is good it does last me a day or two depending on usage. The charging port is outdated, I would much rather have the USB-c port that is available on other models. The screen resolution is less than perfect as well but in this instance, it is an example that you get what you pay for.  My final complaint is the speaker, there is only one and it is in a place that you can and will sometimes cover it by accident. I wish there was more than one. Overall, you get what you pay for.

She had been using an old Iphone 6 that I was no longer using to watch videos and play games.  Here is my experience and what I found.Setting up the unit:  It took a while to get used to the controls coming from using Apple and Android devices.  Overall it was not to bad.  The biggest issue I had was cleaning up the apps screens on both the kid mode and normal modes.  Basically on the normal mode you are stuck with what you get, there is very little changing the screen layout, the screens you see or removing apps from those screens unless you installed them.  The kids mode worked well but it was very limiting, my daughter doesn't like it because she doesn't have any freedoms to install even free apps if she would like, this doesn't bother me to much because she can not browse to find what she could want she just doesn't use it.Modes:  The normal mode would be fine for an adult.  I would warn that it is very cluttered and there is next to no customization on layout or what you do see.  The biggest issue is that you have to link the tablet to an amazon account and everything is one click buy.  I even turned off automatic purchases and it still ended up buying items without a password, I may need to spend more time with this feature but after testing it a couple times I am starting to get shy with hitting the buttons and potentially making a purchase.  The kids mode is adequate but again there is very little customization, I would say more than the normal mode.The construction of the unit is fine, everything works as it should.Ultimately if I could I would return it due to the customization and the either total lock down or total open purchase environment.  It is basically an expensive paper weight in my household.The biggest improvement would be to have all the apps and stores on an app screen that you can access if you want not have it all on your home screens.  Give me one blank home screen like apple or android that I can customize and the amazon fire tablet would be an exceptional value.","Not an Ipad or Android device Replacement.

I had to charge it about once a week, or maybe even a little longer than that between charges. This one, however, uses so much battery life while sitting idle! For instance, this morning I looked at the battery at about 8 am when I woke up and it was 84%. When I went to bed last night, it was at 68%! It had just been sitting there all day and the battery was draining like crazy. I'm very disappointed in this aspect of the new Kindle Fire. You can put it into battery saver mode, which is something I guess? But then the screen dims and there's an orange bar across the top and bottom of the screen. I will play with some settings and do some online research to see what I can do to increase battery life.All that said, I do still really like this Kindle Fire. I just hope I can figure out a way that I don't have to have it plugged in constantly.

Let me tell you about my personal experience with this table and why I like it so much.---STYLE AND DESIGNKindle Fire 7 is a very stylish and gorgeous tablet, in my opinion. It is very light and solid. I love the rectangular shape of the device and also that famous Amazon logo on the back of the tablet. It is very pleasurable to and comfortable to hold this tablet in your hands.---1 GB RAMI had no problems with the speed of my tablet. It is very fast. Even when I have several apps on the background, it still functions without any errors.---UNIVERSALITY AND PRACTICALITYI am using my Kindle Fire 7 more than I use my PC. I use this table for almost everything (reading, browsing the Internet, communicating through messengers, watching movies, reading news, making photos, shopping on Amazon. In my opinion, Kindle Fire 7 is a totally universal and practical tablet.---MEMORYI got my Kindle Fire 7 packed with 16 GB of memory. This amount of storage is more than enough for me. Even though I have hundreds of books, photos, and media on my phone, I still have almost 8GB of free space. What is more, I can also upload additional files to Amazon Cloud.---SILK BROWSERThis browser is very fast and packed with a lot of useful features such as dark mode, private browsing, and etc. I won't install any other browsers since the Silk browser is providing me with everything I need for comfortable and safe Internet browsing.---READING EXPERIENCEI never thought that reading ebooks on an LCD screen can be comfortable. I have already read dozens of ebooks on my Kindle Fire 7. I can tell you that I never felt any eye-strain nor any discomfort. The reading experience is amazing. I see no reading experience difference if I compare Kindle Fire's 7 LCD screen to the E-Ink display. ZERO eye-strain.---SPEAKERS AND MICROPHONEI am using my Kindle Fire 7 for audio chatting, messaging, and watching movies. The sound of the speakers is very good. What is more, its prebuilt microphone's recording abilities are top-notch.---CAMERAAs soon as I tested a camera on my Kindle Fire 7, I understood that it has a high-quality lens since it shoots too good videos and photos for a device packed with only 2MP megapixels. Photos are very sharp and crips. The same qualities can be applied to videos taken with my Kindle Fire 7 (2019)---LOADS OF HELPFUL PREINSTALLED APPSAmazon Kindle Fire 7 came with some truly helpful and convenient apps such as Amazon Shop (for comfortable shopping on Amazon), Kindle Store ( to buy ebooks), News ( to read compilations of news from my favorite news portals), Weather, Prime Video, Amazon Alexa, Amazon Music, and etc. I use all of these services, and therefore, I like this preinstall feature of the tablet.---HANDS-FREE AMAZON ALEXAI also love my tablet because it has hands-free Amazon Alexa. I use it on all occasions for playing music, checking out the weather, news, and other stuff. It is a very beneficial and useful tool.---FINAL WORDSIn my opinion, Amazon Kindle Fire 7 (2019) is one of the best tablets on the market nowadays. It is not expensive. It is smart, stylish, functional, practical, and light.","Universal, light, stylish, and powerful!",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,84,50,382654,Public

Reading text in apps is very difficult, and reading PDFs is worse. Everything looks blurry, and it causes terrible eyestrain. The blue light filter, a feature I love on my phones and the Asus tablet, actually makes things worse, and I've yet to be able to adjust it in a way that makes it useful.One of my complaints is an odd one, considering - the Kindle app on the Fire is the only one that doesn't sync with new content automatically; I have to force items to it by going to Amazon's website.

Within a few mins the device (top part) started to get extremely hot. So I called customer service last night and they said they would remove the ads and waive the fee because it's not supposed to have commercials during a movie.

First of all, the music library takes as much as 30 seconds to appear at all; calling up the last album I listened to can take another 20-30 seconds; clicking on the ""My Music"" link leads to another long delay -- and so it goes. Once the requested album does open, all too frequently not all of its contents are available (a species of thievery committed by Amazon ever since its costly on-line music ""service"" first appeared). These delays are common to both Online and Off-Line music, by the way.I would blame part of these delays on my ATT internet connection were it not for the fact that other kindles I own operate at greater speeds.Another disappointment crops up when I am reading a book and decide to change the background color: what should be a simple, quick transition instead requires several steps because this Kindle looses track reading progress and it's necessary to re-select the book from my library. In fact, I'm returned to the Books category, but it's necessary to select ""Library"" and then tap on the book in progress. Doing this sometimes to a startlingly bright and blank screen before the text reappears. This kind of rig-a-ma-role is not necessary on other Kindles.The only advantage of this (slowly smoldering) Fire Tablet is its comfortable and portable size; however, I cannot understand why Amazon has not adapted the ""origami"" case + stand available for previous versions of this device.",Not as good as previous versions!,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: SageStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,941,115,79025659,Public

Unfortunately, later versions of the Kindle OS have removed the option for games to be stored on an external SD card, which makes external staorage next to useless.  Of the 16 GB internal storage, about half is actually available to store apps and it is amazing how quickly a child will burn through this, as each game requires somewhere between 80 and 200 MB.  To add insult to injury, navigating the Kindle settings and manually uninstalling each app is a tremendous hassle, exacerbated by the painful Free Time carrousel (which does not let you easily seaprate intalled apps from those available for download).  Comparing this clunky interface with my Android phone makes me want to weep.If Amazon wanted to achieve reasonable ease of use, the following changes are suggested: 1. allow for storing apps on an SD card, for heaven's sake! 2. fix the painful Free Time interface for users over 5 years old, allowing filtering intalled apps and easily uninstalling by long press, as has been the option in every other major Android OS for the last 10 years.

The difference is the Ad one is $10-15 USD cheaper depending on whether or not it is on sale.The device when working is a 4/5 stars as it is a Fire Tablet and therefore has a limited App Store and not a normal tablet with iOS or Android with more things, but chances are you are mostly using it because it has a nice screen to read kindle books and not to take pictures or to play the LoL knock-off, Tencent owned Mobile Legends Bang Bang, for example (which is available on Fire Tablet for those that care, which i do not since I am not a fan of that game, but it is pretty popular).The issue is that I purchased my device and three (3)-ish months later the warranty expired which will obviously come into play later. Things worked well initially, but then it randomly gave up on me when trying to update the device. Apparently, it did not do so automatically which I enabled because of ease, and once I realized it was not automatically updating I went to manually update the device which then bricked it right before the full year. So even though Amazon is stating in Orders sections that I have time to replace the item, I can no longer replace it. If enough people report the bricking issue, it hopefully gets patched out for future owners so they are not getting the short end of the stick. So please people report these issues so devs or engineers are aware and can patch them out.Customer support will gladly try to assist to the best of their ability, but their hands are tied and they will only be able to offer a 15% discount and nothing else. So please purchase this device with great paranoia OR just buy a competitor's tablet from another site or competitor's site. Since other's will back up their brand(s) or partnered devices with at least a full one year warranty instead of 3.5 months. I have used phones and other tablets that have lasted me years, and with one year warranties so I have not had a need to get ""extended warranties"" since those competitor devices have been built to last relative to Fire Tablet.Yes, it can sound ""tinfoily"" to say that it is done this way to push the purchases of ""two year extended warranties"" but that is a great business strategy, and I am not arguing or warning against it. However, the issue is they are seemingly aware that their products are not great compared to their competitors and therefore will not back up their Fire Tablets for a full year. Unsure if the Ad version is more likely to brick your phone, so if something breaks report it since maybe there is an issue with the Ad version, i don't know I cannot prove this, but it does not hurt to report things and if there is a patter to get it patched or fixed.So if you get a Fire Tablet, make sure you get it on sale and/or with an extended warranty. I, however, will be hard-pressed to purchase another Fire Tablet and will most likely purchase a competing brand (preferably a South Korean brand since I own several devices that are South Korean brands, and even if made in PR China, they are still working great after 2-5 years depending on when I bought it).",Updates Brick Device & Small Warranty Window,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,14,21,12066806,Public

I purchased this tablet on Prime Day and got a great deal (yay!).  However, it is very small.  I didn't realize how small the screen would be, which is my fault.  I wish now that I had purchased a larger one.- I love the blue light for reading at night.- I was disappointed that the cover Amazon sells to match this wasn't available for two to three months.  Really, Amazon?  So I purchased another one that doesn't really go with my tablet, colorwise, and is just okay.  Would really like to have had the matching cover.- I didn't know this before purchasing, but one of my main reading apps requires some Google downloads.

Both the Fire 10, which I bought  last year, and this new Fire 7 have wifi connection issues: weak reception even next to the antenna and frequent disconnects. My old HD 7 always shows the strongest connection anywhere in the house. My other complaint is the wide-screen display format. My HD 7 has a ""fatter"" screen in portrait mode, which is almost exclusively how I use it. Email, documents, and web pages are all easier to read with a more square screen, which is why all premium tablets (iPad, Surface) use a 3:2 aspect ratio rather the the 16:9 ratio on this new Fire 7. If one only watches movies (with headphones, to avoid using the single, tinny speaker on this Fire model) I suppose it would work fine. The screen is good on this Fire 7 and it has an SD slot for more storage, which are both improvements over my old one. It also seems marginally faster than my old one.  For now, though, because of wifi issues and the aspect ratio of the screen, I'm sticking to my old HD 7 until its demise.","Iffy wifi, best for movie watching",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,14,35,3779210,Public

Even turning the brightness down to a quarter, but also using it consistently, i was getting close to 6 hrs.- I strongly recommend to use the wall charger when charging, and do not use amazons charging cord as this thing is as super stiff to plug in. And I had to almost yank it out, which i think is part of the reason the charging port doesn't last as long on these tablets.- I do notice that it will lag when scrolling at times, and the image is a little grainy, but granted it was under $50 bucks, i ain't complaining.- Playing games is actually quite smooth, i was fairly impressed. For a faster experience overall, make sure to close out of all other apps that don't need to be opened.Overall this tablet doesn't have the best battery life, or build/port quality. However, with the increased size to 16gigs, and slightly faster processor, not to mention that it still is snappy and tons of content within amazon's ecosystem, IMO, its still impressive. And  to get this (especially on sale) under $50 bucks....or 2 for that price on prime day.....its really good.

Awesome.I ordered without analyzing the 'fine print' on the Fire sales page, trusting that its terms coincide in general with those of my first Fire (although subconsciously wondering how the same low price applies after two years and to a bigger and better Fire;  my subconscious said 'wait and see').  This morning, I noticed the battery seems to have a rapid depletion rate compared to my first Fire - from 100% to 88% after an hour (Fire was on, WiFi on, but neither was being used).  I figured the videos and merchandise offers on the lock screen might be draining it.  It turns out that to unsubscribe from those Special Offers, I'll be charged $15, originally set up as a subsidy that makes the $49 price possible.  Buying this 9th generation Fire 7 would otherwise cost $64.99 rather than the $49.99 I paid for it.  On the other hand, one quick swipe directly upwards removes this recurring screen saver and takes you right back to were you were before it came on.I don't know how this purchase will turn out.  Maybe I would have paid the $64.99 after reading the 'fine print', because my Fire is a valuable backup computer.  Maybe the battery life of it actually is longer than that of my 7th generation Fire, as claimed.  Maybe the 16 GB memory will be useful too.  What minor issues the Fire series has, the 7th generation is still an awesome machine.More good news!  Audio would not play through my earphones, continues to play through speakers. This happened on my previous Fire 7 (7th gen.).  I spent the whole day searching for a solution.  Went back home, grabbed all my old earphones, tried them and audio though them instead of through speakers.

The only way you can watch YouTube is in the browser. So my kids probably won’t use it but the good news is that I have already been paying for Disney+ and I pay for prime. After I messed around with them a little bit I’ve come to actually really like this tablet although just be aware that you cannot download the YouTube app which is kind of a bummer. But there are a lot of pluses to this tablet it’ll grow with your child as they age as well. It seems smooth it works well there are child locks on the inside so your child cannot buy stuff but you better make sure they’re on because my child bought something for 24.99😑 Just make sure you have it all set up before you give it to your child. But other than that I actually really like it as a child’s tablet and we’re going to keep them because I like them more than I care that we don’t have kids YouTube.Seriously bought because in the reviews and in the questions it said kids YouTube was allowed to download on it and it’s not. Anything that I want my kids to watch I have to pay for pretty much I’m not that thrilled! I would have never bought if I knew.,Don’t buy if you are dead set on app kids utube!,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,161,129,137589,Public

Having Prime Video along with the Amazon Library of software is a great value in itself. The Appstore seems to have a pretty good amount of apps to enjoy, and the hardware specs are fantastic for the price point. A little more RAM would be welcomed, but if you are getting this for $50 and under you can't complain at all, it's fairly fluid even in the intense applications.Now for part 2: if you install the Google Play Store, this thing really comes to life. Having SnapChat and your favorite mobile games on it is a real treat. I was able to link app accounts I had on my iPhone 8 Plus to a Facebook account and move them over to my Kindle Fire 7 very fluidly and without constant crashes. I just hope they keep the Fire OS Android based for years to come, as it's a developer's treat to tweak it to an even better level of entertainment. There are tech articles that outline a process how to do it, which isn't terribly difficult, just has to be followed in order. If you aren't slightly tech savvy or willing to give something new a try, you probably won't be able to install it. Which isn't the end of the world, as the device already comes packed with great features. I'd say if there were even more apps in the Amazon Appstore, you wouldn't even need to bother with doing this.","Versatility with some tweaking, great value for specs.

I also turned off all notifications for all other apps.  When I listen on the road, I also put it on airplane mode.  Now I don't have any issues with the text-to-speech shutting down.  I only gave four stars for this review because going to all this trouble shouldn't be necessary.  Amazon surely can tweak this problem of their device and fix it.Still, this little Kindle Fire is a great bargain for $49.

When i remove a book from my phone and choose remove from all devices it doesn't remove it on the fire.  Downloading books on the fire is not easy either.  Had one that stayed stuck in the download manager and had to cancel and restart the Fire multiple times before it finally quit trying.  Also books that i wanted to download didnt show up under all in the library but did show up in the collection like the one i saved to my phone.  Maybe there us a glitch with the whispersync part...Bottom line is i only use the fire to save battery on my phone.  My Note 8 has a large screen and the app experience is way better.

First, this is my third Kindle Fire since the product's introduction. I've bought many others for family and friends. Never had an issue until this particular model. First, its one good feature. The camera takes nice, clear pictures. Onto the most irritating, disappointing bad features:  Performance is non-existent. Boot-up is not only super slow, but the app icons are all over the screen when it does come alive. Then, you need to wait another 5-10 seconds for the icons to settle into their assigned positions. The lack of power, which is not available, is so bad that I can't even watch a movie or play a game without interruption or sudden shut down of the app. And that happens with any app, even Facebook. Speaking of apps! The apps that come from Amazon's App Store for this model are not all compatible.  Some need OS functions that this Kindle doesn't have, or they need more power, which this model doesn't offer.  I've had it with this tablet.

Other than reading I use it mostly for playing solitaire and browsing Facebook. The couple things I’ve noticed about it that I don’t like is it’s kind of slow to load/open things sometimes, but for a $30 tablet I can’t complain. Also, I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong, but when looking at Facebook it for some reason cuts the sides off of some things, so I can’t see/read what’s been posted.Update: 6 months into this tablet, it takes so long to do anything, I.e. click the Internet app, it takes a handful of seconds to open. If I am doing something that involves typing I can forget about it, because the keyboard only pops up 30% of the time. It also looses internet connection at random times. The only thing we use it for now is to play white noise on YouTube while my son sleeps, but at some point through the video it looses connection, which obviously makes the white noise stop, which then makes my son start tossing and turning. I know I didn’t spend much on this tablet, but I would never waste $36 on this. That money could go towards a medical bill instead.

And as much as I love Amazon this tablet for me is a hit and miss. First off the screen and display is good.  Volume is decent enough, nothing headphones can't fix... Unfortunately, the tablet starts to dwindle after roughly a few months usage.... The two tablets purchased for Christmas 2019 are constantly in use. My girls won't put them down unless they're charging or they (girls) are asleep so they are always being used. I would say roughly these tablets started being problematic around month 4/5 not really sure... Constant use of these tablets takes a toll after awhile. The ability to connect and stay connected to wifi is frustrating. Then there's the constant freezing of the tablet. Sometimes we have to restart the tablets multiple times, sometimes to no avail. Oh my gees the battery life is almost non existent. No sooner you charge it up it's in need of a charge again in less than a hour. If I would have reviewed them the moment I recieved them I would be happy and positive. But probably  not so happy had I waited a bit longer... But being that it has been since last year that two of these purchases were made, this is a fair and honest enough review. The recent purchases of Amazon's Fire Tablets were from Best Buy. They lasted a good 4 months before problems with wifi connectivity and not being able to do anything with them started. I purchased them from Bestbuy because at the time the time frame for delivery was after the time school would have started and I needed them ASAP... These tablets were for online class curriculums and such ""ONLY"" being that my children are homeschooled due to Covid-19. With that being said they are not used nearly as much as the previous two tablets. They are strictly for school and they are sometimes not used at all during the school period. So same product, same results. After a year you can say ""well at least you got your money's worth"" and I guess you'd be right... But remember that the tablets started not being so good after about four or five months.... The low cost is what caught me last year $39.99 is a hell of a deal and it's and Amazon manufactured tablet... Give it here!! This year they cost $49.99 and I purchased again, yes I did two of them to be exact. In spite of the problems with the previous tablets so my bad... I guess I was hoping for improvement. Anyway, I'm not saying don't buy or it's the worst buy. But I am saying if you plan on long term use spend your money on another brand.

In other words, if I wanted to speak into the microphone to answer an email or comment on Facebook or whatever, I can't do that with this Kindle because it's not there anymore!  I called and asked them if this was a mistake or a fluke and they said (on the phone and in emails) that the microphone is NOT there!  Why in the world would they take away something as useful as that?  To me, it's hard to type on that small keyboard so I spoke into the microphone a lot on my Kindle--not any more!  I am REALLY disappointed in this Kindle version!  I have bought every version of the Kindle since 2009 and this is the first time that I felt the newer version was not better than the previous version in some way.

I have to force myself every time to swipe ""just a bit more aggressively"" to get the page to turn, probably nothing significant for a new kindle user, but man is it aggravating for me.perhaps there is a page turn sensitivity setting im not currently aware of, but i have to say I prefer every single one of my old kindles to this new one.","battery life sucks, also swipe to turn page seems...off",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,130,168,248041,Public

This means that even with apps like Netflix which allow you to download movies for off-WiFi usage, you can drop a huge SD card in this and download all your heart desires.We give them to the boys (ages 4 & 6) and there was a little bit of a learning curve from the iPad. The iPad all hinges around the home button and with this, like any other android, you have the three buttonless buttons that only appear when you have your finger on the bottom of the screen.  So I’m not sure if they could have navigated around like they used to if we have it to them when they were only 2 years old, when they first started using an iPad but they can now.The only thing I wish it had was a more traditional home screen launcher with juts apps. It would be nice to disable the additional tabs (such as “books”, “video”, etc) that you get when swiping from the main launch page.We bought the ones with ads on the home screen. They really aren’t that annoying so we haven’t been tempted to pay the $15 to remove them.",You will never beat this value.,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: Twilight BlueStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,31,27,2974540,Public

Before getting this tablet, I used the free Kindle app on my phone and it was perfectly fine, but there were times when I got annoyed because I would be reading and all sorts of notifications would interrupt me, from social media, phone calls, etc. Since I received this tablet a couple of weeks ago, I have only downloaded two additional apps: YouTube and a Sleep Timer. The Sleep Timer allows me to put the tablet to sleep while using the Text-to-Speech function to listen to ebooks.I have no complaints. I wanted a small tablet that could fit in my small bag. This fits the bill. It's not much bigger than my phone. I wanted a tablet to read ebooks on, so I didn't want it to be too big to hold in my hand (I have ligament problems and holding large things gets difficult). It works for that. I also LOVE that I can use Text-to-Speech to listen to books that don't have professional narration. That was a pleasant surprise, since my phone didn't have that function. I get to complete a lot more books now. I love audio books but many authors I enjoy don't have their books in audio format. This tablet is a great companion for my Kindle Unlimited subscription as I can read books, listen to Audible books (Read and Listen for Free with Kindle Unlimited) AND use the text-to-speech function for other books.

I live my life on tablets and laptops. I'm also a voracious reader in my spare time and while I prefer the old fashioned books you hold in your hands, I have to admit that it is very convenient to put a Kindle in my purse and pull it out when I have to wait at the doctor's office, waiting to pick up a family member, or even in line at the DMV! I take out library books online and they load directly into my Kindle. So easy and convenient! I had my first Kindle Fire for 5 years and never had a moment's trouble with it until my 6-foot tall son stepped on it and broke the screen. I didn't waste any time buying another. I love the size of the Fire and my grandkids love to play games on it. They're too young to be allowed on my laptop I use for work so this is the perfect compromise. It's handy to put a cartoon on when my grandson is fussing in his car seat or my granddaughter wants to make a TikTok. The quality of the Fire is excellent. I got one with 8 GB of memory because I download a lot of apps between my grandkids and me. I have a ton of apps but still haven't run out of memory. If I do, I'll just buy a memory card. The picture is sharp and the sound is surprisingly loud. It's louder than my laptop that I had to buy a Bluetooth speaker for.  I go through laptops pretty fast using them so much for my job so when they crash my Kindle is great to watch my movies and shows in an emergency. Its battery life is about 4 hours. This new Kindle charges much faster than my original one too. The only negative thing I can say about this Kindle is there is a lag time when I touch something to open, about 10-15 seconds that my old one didn't have. When I turn it on and swipe the locked screen sometimes I have to swipe it 4 or 5 times before it opens. Those issues aren't a big deal but it's one of the little things that bug me. I use the Document app for making notes for work while I'm out and it's easily transferred to my laptop with the sharing option and syncing. I have not activated Alexa because I'm not really into that but it's a great feature to have if I ever want to use it. One thing I loved was I thought I'd lost all my pictures after my first Kindle was crushed but when I activated my new Kindle ALL my pictures from the previous 5 years, including pics of my newborn grandbabies, were all there and loaded into my new Kindle when I signed on. That was such a wonderful thing to discover! I'm really grateful for that. This price was $49.98 which is a steal for what you get and they last forever. Aside from being crushed when stepped on by a grown man, this device is extremely durable. My grandkids are 1 year, 2 years, and 7 years old and I allow them to carry it around and use it by themselves. They're constantly dropping it, stepping on it, and throwing it but it hasn't cracked or been damaged in any way. If it does it's easily replaceable at that price.

The original is actually still in use; I keep it bedside to read books and play the occasional game when I can't sleep.This new version of the tablet is excellent.  The value for the money is significant.  The upgraded OS is compatible with so many different apps.  The display is crisp and clean, and the speed at which it processes commands is fast.  What I find most handy is that I can walk up to it, even when it's asleep, and issue an Alexa command and it will transmit it immediately.  The new version is much lighter and better constructed, and I love the new case.  If this one lasts as long as the original, I'll be quite happy!UPDATED 04/25/2020:  My first review didn't mention battery life... the battery life on this unit is questionable.  If you use it at all each day, you'll want to charge it every evening.  Even if you don't use it, the battery drains at an alarming rate.  I finally bit the bullet and paid the $15.00 plus tax to get rid of the ads, and I've found that actually helped to extend battery life somewhat.While Amazon has a wide variety of apps available for the Fire, unfortunately some of the apps and games I really wanted to use aren't available.  I did a bit of research online, and quickly learned that I could turn off one security settings, download and install 4 files, and then have full access to the Google Play store and all of it's apps.  The whole process took about 5 minutes, and the value it added to this device is phenomenal! This has become my go to device, replacing an aging iPad.  I can't believe how easy the process was, and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs access to more than the Fire store has to offer.  Be aware that this hack may invalidate or impact Amazon's warranty for the device, but for me, the ability to open the device to a realm of new functionality is well worth the risk.","Fast, capable, easy to read/use, Alexa capability,",Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,2330,695,10707,Public

I knew my mother would lose her sanity & assist in making me lose mines because she wouldn't be able to watch news. LOL! So I surprised her with this and she has been glued to it ever since. She uses it for internet purposes, keeping in touch with family & friends via Whatsapp, browsing YouTube for music and hair tutorial, among other things. The setup was easy yet a bit complex. Why? She just wanted to get straight to using but it took a good 45 minutes to go through the setup process, downloading apps and connecting to the WiFi. I don't like the pre-downloaded apps, it seems you cannot delete to make space with the storage. Also, you cannot really personalize the home screen. The play store makes it somewhat difficult to find apps even when you search it directly. It took awhile to find the actual Whatsapp and download it. The screen size is smaller than I thought and the camera quality to be honest is horrible! If you understood the jokes between having an Android and an iPhone then you'd understand when I say the camera quality resembles an old school Android. LOL! Long story short, it's not for me. It was for her so as long as she enjoys it and can do whatever it's intended for then -- I'm good.

Also, it appears Lookout mobile security and antivirus app for Kindle is no longer available. Disappointing.  Battery life not bad but not quite as good as the 5th gen.

Their reliability is low, they're very glitchy, and we simply aren't impressed.We bought two of these tablets on sale for our kids for a road trip. We basically just needed them for watching movies and shows on Disney+. All that we downloaded on each tablet was Disney+ and 2 or 3 small toddler games. Then, we attempted downloading a few movies/TV shows in the Disney+ app on each tablet. This very small amount of storage use on the tablets has simply wrecked their usability. They are wildly inconsistent in connecting to the internet and bluetooth, and sometimes they flat out won't work. I'll turn it on or restart it, open Disney+ and it'll just sit there for minutes trying to load. I'll come back to it a few minutes later and it's logged off. I'll set up a movie download and it'll just close the app. I'll click on an app 8 times and it won't open, so I'll open another one, and then literally several minutes later it will open the original app that I wanted and crash the whole system. It'll connect to bluetooth one day and not the next. One tablet will load and play a show just fine and then the other will simply decide not to work that day--then they'll switch places the next time we use them. We've only used them for maybe a total of 30 hrs of playtime and they're sluggish as if we've had them for years. We even tried factory resetting them (even though they hardly had anything on them), and they still didn't work well. Again, we haven't bogged them down with 50 apps, and they're practically brand new.I know they were cheap, but I think these tablets were only worth about $10, not the $30 we paid for them on sale, and certainly not the $50 they are normally. If you want something that you can count on even remotely, this is not the tablet. The inconsistency and unreliability shocks me.

This issue isn't as trivial as it may seem.The older 2017 (7th Generation) Fire 7 is based on Android 5.1.1The new 2019 (9th Generation) Fire 7 is based on Android 7.1The 2017 tablet will not receive a newer OS. So this distinction is important if you want to run apps other than those that are pre-installed. Many apps simply will not be available for the older version of Android.Other than that it is much faster.I ran benchmarks that were compatible with both Fire 7s. However, it is difficult to assess the true strength of the new Fire 7 (2019) since the old Fire 7 (2017) could not run current benchmarks due to its old OS.On Geekbench 4, the new 2019 tablet puts up a 46% better score.On PassMark, the new 2019 tablet scores more than twice the CPU numbers.The new fire tablet also render images more than 50% faster than the old tablet. This means it draws, moves, scales, and rotates images faster. Consequently, this translates to faster UI performance and a smoother less laggy experience.Amazon has also bumped up the storage from 8 to 16GB and from 16GB to 32GB. Which means more space for apps and photos. Write speeds on the new tablet have improved significantly to 82% faster; while reads have decreased 35%.Unfortunately, memory has remained at 1GB. This does not present a major issue as the tablet cannot effectively run more than one resource intensive app at a time. But this may make using the tablet more tedious since it will be up the user to preemptively close open apps and wait for background tasks to complete before launching more apps. The upside is memory performance is more than twice as fast as the outgoing tablet.The few other improvements have made its way into the new tablet such as raising the MicroSD card limit from 256GB to 512GB and updating the front (selfie) cam to a more respectable 2MP from 0.7MPAnyone looking for a Bluetooth improvement will be disappointed as it has remained at 4.1LE.

So before I protected access to the device, anyone who was able to pick it up would be able to access my email. 2) I had to call Amazon support (which is easy to do, as they respond quickly) to figure out how to read my Amazon books on this device. On my computer, when I go to Amazon Content and Devices, it gives me the option to click on Read to read a book. But on the Fire Tablet, you have to download the book before you can read it.

Although the Fire 7 is faster than the 8 the quality of the glass screen leaves something to be desired.  Last night I left my phone charging slightly overlapping my Fire 7 on my bed and my screen on the Fire 7 developed a long crack across the entire screen after my car (who's not overweight, only about 15lbs and very tall and long) decided he was going to lay on my devices for a bit.I have a very old Kindle fire that I won in a contest in 2014 that I have carried around with me, dropped on cement and tile, rolled over on while sleeping, sat on, and have placed in my work bag with different type of bottles (glass, metal, plastic) and I have not had any issues with the screen cracking or breaking.

It took forever to register, as it kept starting itself over halfway through the process and kept saying it needed to be connected to a WiFi network while also saying it was already connected to my home WiFi. Once I finally got it registered I opened to my book library and Lo and behold, the same crashing issue started within a few days. Keep in mind it’s not like I was overwhelming the device’s processing or memory capabilities by having multiple apps open at once. Occasionally I would watch Netflix but rarely. Other than that, I used it solely to read. There was no gaming, no apps of any other kind were ever open or even downloaded. I called support again and they recommended the same troubleshooting processes, which yielded the same results (not a permanent fix before the issue would start all over again). They even did a diagnostic on it and emailed back saying the problem was I had too many apps open in the background, to which I responded I never use any apps other than my book library, so how it that possible?? By the time I finally got around to saying forget it, just give me my money back, it was too late because I’d bought the device from a third party retailer (Best Buy) and my warranty had expired. Now I’m out $40.00 and stuck with a kindle that crashes when I so much as blink at it. I don’t know if these bugs are in this generation or not but I’m hesitant now to buy another fire kindle at all.

I’m contemplating sending it back because I can install kindle on anything.Too bad I can’t say the same for this.Also, if you hate advertisements, you have to pay extra so they won’t be on your lock screen.I read somewhere in the comments that they can be disabled.It’s not true.I find it distasteful that we pay for a product and are expected to pay more to leave OFF the “offers.”It’s a nice tablet, but I wish I just went for something that has more freedom and doesn’t force ads on us because we don’t want to pay the extra money not to be pestered by it.I cannot uninstall a lot of applications I don’t need.

However, I want to give people a heads up about the Amazon fire tablet 7. I preordered this. Got it brand new back in June this year. Great price, the case was more expensive than the tablet...  I purchased this solely for the purpose of using amazon coins for in-app (game) purchases. This device...ITS SO SLOW. I wasn’t even able to finish setting up basic things (e.g., Alexa, etc.) because it would be stuck in loading and time out after 45 minutes of waiting. No matter the strength of my WiFi connection, cannot even search anything in the web browser. It takes so long to open an app or do anything. I can’t imagine relying on this thing for anything other what I bought it for. It’s ridiculous.  If you are looking to buy a multifunctional tablet that won’t increase your blood pressure- look elsewhere. (Buy an ipad—if you’re anti-apple then try something else. Just not this.) You’ll thank me later. If you plan to use it for 5 minutes at a time to make in game purchases with coins. This is for you.  Side note: the case. I think I was able to make it stand the device up 2 times the first day I got it. Since then I’m at 0:25.  Lastly, I’m not going to blame the device but I cracked the screen somehow...with the case on.. (cough cough) and was going to try to take advantage of the trade in to replace it so I can keep making in-app purchases. Brand new fire 7 they offer 10$ (reasonable).  However, trade in is only available for the limited edition tangerine color. This thing is brand new (minus the screen damage) but you would think they would accept trade ins for their new gen products. Something else for tablet shoppers to consider as well. And I wasn’t stupid enough to buy the device protection they offer - not sure if they cover cracked screens, but I don’t see a service for fixing it. And I’m pretty sure (Dont quote me I didn’t put in much effort looking into this) if you buy a screen repair kit and you tube it, you’ll probably void some manufacturer warranty. And won’t be able to trade it in the future (if they ever accept them) To buy another is only $30-40 now. They’re essentially disposable. Like toilet paper. Not to sound cliche but here it is anyway: You get what you pay for.Final comment: every dollar counts. Don’t waste it on this. Invest in something you won’t consider throwing into a busy street every time you pick it up and use it.",My flip phone was faster...You get what you pay for.,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: PlumStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,,,52,31,5078690,Public

The screen is good for content consumtion. The parental controls are solid. There are some issues though. For starters the display has no form of Oil Phobic coating at all. This coating has been available since the iPhone 4 so when the smudges come they come. Personally I would have sacrificed the rear mediocre camera for this coating but due too Amazon's camera integration with the app it's pretty much a nessesity. The camera has the same quality as a Nintendo 3ds. The unit of measure for this camera might as well be called killo pixels. This is a solid detox tablet. It's great for kids. The sage finish is lovely and I'm enjoying the tablet for $50 you can't complain. If you want top of the line specs on a tablet either buy a surface book or an iPad pro.

I have used this tablet daily for just about everything: surfing the web, listening to music, watching videos, gaming... It is so useful and has become a staple in my day to day activities. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this tablet, I was expecting it to be pretty cheap at only about $50 but since I mainly wanted it for simple daily tasks I didn’t want to spend a fortune on it. And this fit what I needed perfectly! Better than I was expecting. The screen is great everything looks clear and bright, although the glass is very reflective and leaves finger prints but it was easily fixed with a matte anti glare/anti fingerprint screen protector. The audio is also very good and clear. It runs surprisingly fast, I was expecting it to be a bit slow and laggy when surfing the net or especially when gaming such as Minecraft etc. but I haven’t had a problem with speed. It’s very responsive, honestly it’s as fast as my iPhone. The colors are a big bonus. I love the unique selection, I got the sage green and it’s beautiful! Exactly as pictured. It was actually one of the main selling points that made me decide to try this tablet was because of the visual appeal, it’s nice to have a nice classy pop of color rather than a stereotypical gray or black device. I would love to see a blush pink color option added in the future but that’s just wishful thinking. It’s a good size too, easy to carry in my bag on the go, but still big enough to game and watch videos comfortably. It’s about the size of your average paperback book just slightly narrower. I also like that you can have multiple sign on accounts and kid accounts. The restrictions and curfew settings are pretty great and would make a great family device, or for those like me who like to keep themselves accountable. I also like that you can increase the existing internal storage with a micro SD card.Now as for cons, I don’t have any big ones, at least they are not deal breakers. My only complaints are these 4 things:1.the battery does charge slowly, (the only reason I gave 4 stars for the battery) it usually takes a couple hours to charge, but it’s not too much of a hinderance. The battery life is pretty good, it lasts a while and I always get a few solid hours use before the battery starts getting low.2. The tablet starts to get hot after extended use. Since it has a plastic backing it gets a wee bit hot to the touch especially if it’s in a case, but again it’s not that big of a deal and it does cool down fast once I turn it off.3. More of a wish than a con but I wish it was procreate/photoshop compatible and that procreate or photoshop were available in the AppStore not just knockoffs. As an artist myself I would love to be able to do digital art on this, or if Amazon came out with a tablet and pencil specifically for art I would totally be down. I would prefer not to spend $1000+ on the iPad Pro just for my art.4. Again another wish rather than an actual con but I wish the newly released Call of Duty Mobile app was available in the Amazon AppStore. Actually I really wish they had more of a selection of apps, there’s precious little, if any, of the actual big name games and apps available, most of them are just knock offs.Over all I love my Fire 7 it’s a great tablet, can’t beat the quality for price point.",Possibly the best $50 I’ve spent on myself so far,Digital Storage Capacity: 16 GBOffer Type: Ad-SupportedColor: BlackStyle: Fire 7Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,6,2,8123068,Public

There are about 20 pre-loaded apps that you cannot delete, even if you don’t plan on using them.2. It seems like the WiFi connection is always less than stellar, even when my other devices have great connections.3. Can be sluggish and slow to respond at times, but not hugely noticeable.4. Very basic screen and picture quality.5. Due to the mono speaker, I don’t recommend using this without headphones.6. Because it is an Amazon-altered Android system, there are certain apps that you are unable to download, unlike a typical Android system.The good:1. The price! There’s a lot of bang for your buck here.2. I love the size, quite a bit bigger than a phone, but not huge. Perfect for travel.3.

One, you can't adjust the size of the type when reading a Kindle book to anything like a size that makes it easy for older eyes to read.  This is not a problem on the original Kindle Reader, and I don't see why the font size on the Fire is still small even at its highest adjustment level.  The original Kindle Fire was better for book readers.  Two, the screen is virtually unreadable in sunlight, just like the original Kindle Fire, and also unlike the Kindle Reader, which works just fine in sunshine but isn't a ""smart"" tablet at all.  If you're using the Fire models indoors and your eyes are capable of reading small print, you'll probably love them.

The battery life is not very good either. I got my fire on a monthly pay plan since it was offered and I’m stuck with ads!

They want to just number the devices 1, 2, 3, etc....I did change through Amazon and I hope I was successful in doing the same on the actual Kindle.  Also, the parental application leaves a lot to be desired. On one hand, they would like to charge you for this through some program.
