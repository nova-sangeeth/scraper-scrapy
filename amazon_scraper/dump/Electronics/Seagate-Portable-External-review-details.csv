One guy stated that it took an hour and a half to move 80 gb, but for me it took an hour and fifteen minutes to move 160 gb. He was probably using a USB 2.0 port, which transfers data slower. Make sure the port your using is actually a USB 3.0 port. My laptop, for instance, has two 3.0 ports on the left and one 2.0 port on the right. Another thing that effects write speed is the amount of files. Moving a single 5 gb file will be faster than moving a 5 gb folder with 200 files in it. The reason is that the computer has to take a microsecond in between each moved file to change files. Also, this hard drive takes a few seonds to spin up if left inactive for too long.

Even though this is my 3rd one in 3 years...  The storage capacity, and portability are their biggest pros.  However there could be a lot done to the device to make it better.  First off you have to be very careful when handling this device, one drop, or it hitting something in your bag during transport, can, and more than likely will cause irreparable damage.  I have gone through three because of this.  The first one dropped less than a foot, hit the carpet, and quit working.  The second one hit my laptop while I was driving home, and quit working.  The third one I didn’t drop at all, and it randomly quit after 5 months.  Luckily they’re good about their warranties, even though the application on the website is a humongous pain in the ass.  I had to restart it over 5 different times because it would randomly take me back to the home page, and you couldn’t read or click on half of the parts.  Needless to say after 3 hours of trying, I stopped and contacted them over the phone.  The person who helped me was extremely nice, and apologized about the technical issues on the site.  The second thing they could work on to make it better would be to work on the heat issue, this device gets extremely hot after using it for hours.  Lastly they could make, or purchase a better usb2.0/3.0 cord; the ones they give you are absolute crap.  They last for a few months, 6 at most before they stop working.  My guess is it’s a cheap product purchased in bulk.  If Seagate would take the time to fix these issues, I believe they would have the best EHDs on the market.  Only because of the portability, storage capacity, and customer service do I give this product 3 stars.  Without those three things, I’d advise people not to buy them.

Yes, I have the TerraMaster RAID drive, but the 4K video in the picture is playing from the Seagate drive, not the TerraMaster.  I mostly use this Seagate drive (STGY8000400) as a backup drive, and I have had no issues with it so far for a year (knock on wood).  I'm about to order a second one because I need more backup space (I shoot and edit 4K video).  You can see it's very low on space, so it's time for me to add a clean drive.Formatting for a Mac is easy.  Step 1, ignore the software that comes with the drive.  It's useless.  Instead, open Disk Utility, connect the drive, and use Disk Utility to format the drive to HFS+.  The drive will be fine without the bloatware that comes with it.  Now, it will just act like a hard drive.By the way, most external hard drives are Mac compatible if they are formatted properly the first time they are connected.  The NTFS for Mac software is only required if one intends to use a drive to transfer files between Mac and Windows.I'm using Carbon Copy Cloner as my backup software, instead of Apple's Time Machine.  Once Time Machine fills up, it stops backing up, and it's a pain to delete old items.  I find CCC to be much faster and much more stable, and it gives me better warnings when it encounters trouble.  I'm also using Backblaze as a secondary off-site backup.  2 is 1 and 1 is none.As far as sending files to it, I don't have problems with the transfer speed.  For anyone having trouble, I'd recommend checking the cabling first and foremost to make sure both the power supply and the USB 3.0 cable are the proper ones, and then listening to the drive for the dreaded ""click of death.""  If you have the ""click of death,"" let Seagate know and get a replacement.  In my experience, dead drives are a plague of Seagate.  I've had a few in the past.

Obviously the price was right for the amount of storage capacity and with the way technology moves, I didn't think much about the lower price, chalking it up to how the world of technology evolves and gets cheaper over time.  This assumption came at a cost.  After researching and shucking one of the drives that failed (conveniently for Seagate,  outside the 1-year warranty) I discovered that the drives they are throwing in the external shells are regular Barracudas.  Nothing to cause alarm yet, Barracudas are supposed to be good reliable drives right?  Digging a little deeper, I discover that Seagate, Western Digital and pretty much every other drive manufacturers are starting to use SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) technology on their cheaper consumer drives, making the price more feasible for a greater number of consumers.  The problem is, these drives are only really good for archival purposes, meaning, you should really only write files to the drive once, never deleting, moving, or re-writing files without major stability issues due to the nature of the way this drive writes data.  There are plenty of articles about SMR technology if you google ""SMR drive"" so I won't go into too technical of a description of how that works, but basically for me, who was expecting to be able to use this drive as I have every other drive I've owned for the last 35+ years, I was sadly mistaken.  The act of moving files or deleting and rewriting information seemed to be such a routine and mundane task that I never would imagine that kind of action would contribute to the premature death of 3 of these drives.","3 drives have failed in less that 2 years.

I had to go over each folder to ensure transfer. These so called ""experts"" and ""power users"" have very low standards of quality and durability. Which regardless of brand, averaged 3 years.

I did not read the reviews until I plugged it into my 2016 MacBook Pro, which has macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.  That is when I learned that it was formatted for PC.  So, I looked up the product that I had ordered on Amazon to make sure it said for Mac. This is when I read multiple reviews stating that it doesn't work for Mac, especially anything later than Mac OS 10.10. I started to freak out internally, but kept my composure and decided to try formatting the drive anyway by following the formatting instructions that Seagate gives you when registering the product. Although the formatting instructions are outdated and say that it's for Mac OS 10.6 to 10.10, they were easy to follow--my 10.13.6 version of disk utility is slightly different than the pictures in the instructions, but it worked...I partitioned the device and reformatted to ""Mac OS Extended (Journaled)"" just like the instructions said to do. I clicked partition, it took 30 seconds or so, and then it was done. Now the drive works and I can drag and drop files there with ease. I then went back to the Seagate registration page that I left open in my browser, clicked next for ""Set up your drive to work with Macs"" and the checkbox that was previously empty was now filled with a green check. I'm not sure if the others on here followed instructions (I saw reviews as recent as June 2020 that said it doesn't work for Mac), or if Seagate simply fixed the issues between June 2020 and now (I am writing this review on August 11, 2020). But I can confirm that, for my version of Mac OS, it works.

The fault was the internal 1TB hard drive in my PC had started running out of space from my documents and photos (I'm a writer and artist) after eight years of use. The solution given the age of my desktop computer was to pay a local young man a very reasonable price to install a new 2TB internal hard drive, which also allowed several Windows 10 updates with the extra space. The PC is now acting like a new computer. Note that he cloned the old hard drive to the new one so there was no need to reload programs; even my briefcase links still worked with the new 2TB hard drive. All of this made the two 4TB Seagate external hard drives work as intended at the time of purchase. I'm very pleased! FYI: In the future when buying a new PC or external hard drive I'm going to make sure they are the more modern ""solid state"" components.I have two 1TB Seagate external hard drives that usually take around 5 hours to backup all of my documents. This new 4TB Seagate has been downloading 19 hours and is only three quarters of the way finished. I'm not happy and bought two. Why are they so incredibly SLOW? A week later I contacted Seagate support that tried blaming my computer after eliminating all other possibilities. So I'm returning both units and switching to Western Digital.

We humans can be weird and somehow when shopping, look for any small financial savings without taking our precious time and the content of our data into account.  I am such a person- chose to save money and buy the Seagate. I regret it pretty much every time.On this purchase, I did a 10TB clone from a master drive to this off-site backup. The drive was loud enough that I had to move it to a different room and use a laptop to do the clone. The next morning, the drive was doing a rhythmic click and giving errors. So after about 24 hours of sustained writes, it failed. Amazon replaced it the next day but now I have anxiety each time I use it. So, 2 stars because the cost is right but wow is it worth it?

It's suitable for storing your data, but I don't recommend using it for anything that requires a lot of access (ie, heavy photo/video editing, daily backups, watching movies).I use it for a semi-production task. It holds photos of 3D scan data for 3D modeling and essentially gets accessed for computation once every 1-2 hours for loading program scene and then building the initial 3D models from the images. After that, the build data is moved to another drive for actual work.I would not use this for any type of full production or any work that requires a lot of constant access to the drive. Could not image trying to do video editing or full 3D work off this drive. It's too slow and has a bit of a warm up spin. I have a 32TB RAID of another brand with physical discs that reads/writes way faster than this drive, yet both have disc that rotate at same speed.I have not had any issues with it disconnecting or losing power. Its black finish and small light indicator are not visual distractions while working. It's relatively quiet when it spins up, but makes a detectable vibration on my desk at start up. This old warm-up spin is annoying in the age of instant access SSDs, but I need to remember to be patient with spinning disc like this.","Good for storage drive, not for production work",Color: BlackCapacity: 8TBStyle: Desktop HDDVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,218,115,238199,Public

However, I bought two of these drives and made a second back up on the second drive.  Lo and behold, the second time the backup was much, much faster and only took about 4 1/2 hours to complete the transfer of 766GB of data (Music - 100K+ songs).  I'm not really sure why it went nearly 6 times faster the second time as compared to the first time.  I would swear that I plugged the drive into a USB 3.0 port (Blue) the first time, too.  However, for whatever reason, the first time I backed up the music collection, it took nearly 24 hours to complete, but the second time it took about 4.5 hours.  So perhaps my computer is to blame? At this point, I really don't know.  I can only say that the second time around was a LOT faster and I was EXTREMELY pleased with the rate of transfer, as it was in line with what I was expecting for a drive that is supposed to support USB 3.0, which has a theoretical max speed of 120Mbps.  So averaging 60Mbps is more than reasonable and I saw it get up to 90Mbps for transfer speeds at times, too.So, after the second try, I will rescind my previous rating of 2/5 stars and raise it to 4.5/5 stars.  The only reason I'm not giving it the full 5/5 stars is that there is still doubt in my mind as to what happened with the other drive. Hopefully, you will have the same luck as I had with the second drive.  For $50, its a great deal no matter what, provided you're only using it for making backups and not a ""working"" drive that will be constantly accessed throughout the day.I bought this drive expressly to make a copy of my 766GB music collection.  I liked the price a lot and that the drive was capable of USB 3.0, which I also have on my Desktop computer.  Upon receipt of the drive, I checked the cable to make sure it was also USB 3.0 (it's blue inside, that's how you can tell).  Then I plugged it into my Desktop computer on a corresponding USB 3.0 port (Blue).  The desktop computer recognized the drive without issue and I then began the process of copying over my 766GB music collection from the Music folder on my computer to a Music folder on the new drive.  What I did not anticipate was that it would take nearly 20 hours to complete the transfer and at an average transfer speed of about 10MB/s.  As a result, this drive is only good for making backups and nothing more.  So if you have the time and are short on $$$, this drive does still have value.  But if you are in any kind of hurry, this drive is not the drive you want - not even close.  You can see the screen shots I took from beginning to end of the file transfer process to get a better idea of what I'm talking about.The Good- This drive costs just under $50- This drive is very portable and doesn't require a secondary power sourceThe Bad- This drive is extremely slow, despite using USB 3.0, which has a theoretical transfer speed of 120 MB/s. *  *NOTE: Theoretical is the keyword here.  It would be reasonable to expect a transfer speed of 60 MB/s over a  USB 3.0 connection.- This drive should only be used for backups and not a ""working drive"" I.E. one that you are constantly having to  access throughout your work day.Rating: 2/5 stars.  I'm giving it 2 stars for portability and price.  I'm subtracting 3 stars for how ridiculously slow the write speed is for a drive that is supposed to be USB 3.0 compliant, but transferred my music collection at what appeared to be USB 2.0 speeds.","Fantastic Price, Better performance than previously thought",Color: BlackCapacity: 1TBStyle: Portable HDDVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,,282618,

I'm done with them.  I just hope I can recover some files.  I use this mostly for disk image backup (typically 32GB or 64GB each) for embedded systems.  I've had this for about 10 months.  It gets used very very seldom.  But I keep having to scan this NTFS-formatted drive and repair it.  Today, Windows (latest patches of version 10) said it would take 1:15 (HH:MM), then it puked at about 4:45 remaining (yes, it went up several times during the repair).  And this thing is incredibly slow, despite my previous update.  It seemed to slow down as it got more full, and the longer it was connected to a computer.  I copied many files to it in Linux, and by the time I gave up and decided to check it under Windows, it was writing at about 200kB every five seconds (about 40kB/sec) on that Linux machine- which has two 4TB drives from WD that are working constantly for at least a year.Update:  It's been a few days since I wrote the initial review below (on 2019-07-20).  My PC has been powered off (thanks to a neighborhood power failure) since then.  I am writing some 100+ GB files and am getting speeds between 94 and 126 MB/sec now (varies between those over time).  I will check the read speed later.  I couldn't let my previous review stand.Original review:  This thing is incredibly slow. Sequential writes happen at about 26MB/s, reads at a bit more than 100 (using a USB 3.0 connection that gets me about 4x the write speeds with other drives).  I've been burned by Seagate drives a few times, and pretty much stick to WD, and Samsung.  I do have a few 6+ year-old Seagates that get occasional use as backup drives.  I don't know if I can live with the slow speeds of this drive.  And if I do, I am not sure it will last very long.

I also have a 2 TB drive I am writing to that easily achieves 120 MB/sec, so the computer can transfer files at that speed. It just seems that Seagate decided to scrimp on either the hardware or the platter speed (the platter is a magnetically-coated steel plate on which the one-and-zeros are stored), probably to make a price point. Where they got """"160 MB/sec"" is a mystery (or a lie).You want 8 TB and don't care about transfer speed, then I guess this is your drive. You want to take 12 hours moving 2 TB onto a drive (which was last night's experience for me), then this is your drive. You want things faster? Then try another manufacturer.

Admittedly, I just got it, but so far it's working perfectly.I was alarmed at first, because it was randomly disconnecting and reconnecting. I wasn't even thinking about trying to do a backup or even not returning it at that point, but after using the ""safely eject"" method in windows and moving the usb connection to a port on the back of my tower and waiting about a half hour to see if it would maintain the connection, I was satisfied that it was just the port on the top of my computer.To be fair, half of all the usb ports on all of my electronics do that eventually, especially if you connect and disconnect routinely.Anyway, I then downloaded the seagate disc wizard from their website, which seems to be a free ""light"" version of Acronis. I wasn't thrilled with their ""toolkit"" option that you get initially when you register. I suppose that's just a personal preference, but it seemed similar to mobile apps that you run across these days where everything is over simplified.I used the disc wizard program to do a full backup of my system drive and it took 10 minutes. My system drive is an m.2 256gb ssd. before I go to bed tonight I'll start a full backup including the D drive which is a 1tb hdd. If I find that takes hours and hours I'll just forego the d drive backups. The d drive just contains some games that I can re-download from steam anytime anyway and some documents that get backed up on a flash drive every 10 minutes by windows file history. I've got plenty of room to move those to the c drive if I want a second backup on the seagate drive without regular backups of the d drive.I don't see how the other reviewers are having all these problems with the speed. Maybe it will become clearer when I try to do a larger backup.I'm using a relatively new (1 year old) I7 premium specs system, and I imagine there are many bottlenecks that one could encounter if using an older or just plain lower spec system. Maybe that could contribute to some of the negative reviews? Not that that would be the reviewers fault, but it wouldn't be Seagate's fault either.

They have both been good external drives; so I just bought this Seagate 5 Tb drive.My first impression of this disc drive was, ""Man, this thing is SLOW"".  It took 7.5 hours to backup 3.4 Tb worth of data.  This same backup only took about 2-3 hours when I backed up the date to my older USB external discs.  (YES, I checked my USB cable ... and YES, it was fully seated on both ends.)Next, I ran some random checks on the data I had backed up.  Using a file comparison program, I discovered that 350 of my photo files did not copy onto this new disc drive.  Why?  Your guess is as good as mine.  There was nothing unusual (i.e.  filename, size, read/write attributes,  etc.) about the files that didn't copy.  Also, I didn't get any error or warning messages about the files that weren't copied.Another test I tried involved trying to deleting a nested folder that contained 50,000 photos, Window went through the motion of detecting the files; but then it didn't actually delete them.  This happened repeatedly.  The only way I could delete the files was to go down into the actual subfolder that contained them.Next, I tried connecting this disc drive to my husband's Dell XPS computer, which is still running Windows 7.  His computer said the disc drive had to be formatted before it could be used.I can't trust a disc drive that is this unreliable; so I initiated action to return it.  In the meanwhile, I started looking at other brand ... WD, Toshiba, etc.  Unfortunately, their ratings on them were pretty much on par with this Seagate drive; with many of the same problems.As I was clearing my data off of this 5 Tb disc drive, a light bulb came on in my brain.  I remembered  there was a time when Windows couldn’t access a disc drive that was larger than 2 Tb.  That made me wonder if the problems, copying and deleting files, were due to this disc drive’s large data capacity.  Perhaps, Windows 10 was ""choking"" on the size of this disc's file allocation table.I decided to partition this disc into 2 logical disc drives. Since I already have a separate 3 Tb USB disc drive, which works fine with Windows 10, I made one partition 3 Tb.  Then, I used the remaining free spaces for a second disc partition.  Next, I formatted both of these new partitions as NTFS.  This two partition configuration now seems to be work properly with Windows 10.This drive is still very SLOW; but at least partitioning it seems to have resolved the data accuracy problems.  Also, my husband’s computer can now recognize the separate disc partitions.",Almost returned it,Color: BlackCapacity: 5TBStyle: Portable HDDVerified Purchase,,,,3398033,

But who doesn't like variety? I missed good old ""Zombie Army Trilogy""!Flash forward to 2020, and with the latest version of the PS4 system software installed, you can easily add an external storage drive to your PS4 console - just make sure you read all of the information on Playstation's website before you do so (there's also useful 3rd party videos on YouTube, but I got the latest & straightest poop from Sony's website).A few obeservations:Again, contrary to what some other people have posted here, if you are considering this Seagate drive (and you have the current PS4 System Software installed) this drive will work! It's almost 'plug and play' - you do have to format the drive (this goes really quick), and you do have to specify that you want to use this drive for game storage when you first hook it up (actually, all of this is clearly explained onscreen once you plug in the drive and turn on your PS4).The drive comes with a shortish USB cable, which was sufficient length to plop the drive on top of your console.One side of the cable is the typical ""Type A"" connector, the other end is the micro super speed connector that  connects to the Seagate storage drive.  I don't know if I just wasn't looking close enough or if it's a thing with first gen PS4 systems, but I didn't see a ""Type A"" USB connector on the back of my console (just a USB ""Type B"" or printer type connector), so I ended up hooking this drive to one of the PS4's front panel USB ports. Works.This drive is pre-formatted for use with PC/Macs, so I was fearing a long reformat time on the PS4.  It actually only took about a minute.I bought the 4Tb drive - once formatted, the actual usable storage space on my PS4 is 3.68Tb (92%). I am not complaining.Final thought - if you are considering buying the 2Tb drive, I would suggest spending the extra money and getting the 4Tb drive.  Currently, there are always some really good deals on great title downloads from the Playstation store, and with the PS5 on the horizon, these deals will most likely continue - I'm glad I sprang for the extra room.

I learned this the hard way. Get a conventional hdd (or ssd) instead for these common applications.(*)Explanation: SMR drives cram more data onto a platter by physically overlapping one file with another, just like roofing shingles or a tandem garage. The drive can read the entire file back from just the exposed part of the ""shingle"" alone...no slowdown involved, as long as you're just reading what's there.But if you want to write to (move, modify, delete) a file in an already-shingled area, you first have to tear up & move ALL the overlapping shingles, replace the target(s), then retrieve & reinstall the others. You can easily imagine how much extra time that takes. Now imagine modifying or moving hundreds of small files or pieces of files, or rebuilding a RAID mirror set, or defragmenting a drive that's over half full...massive, aggravating traffic jam.",Users & shuckers beware!,Color: BlackCapacity: 8TBStyle: Desktop HDDVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,559,35,5018516,Public

What you see is what yo get. It is as ""plush"" as Sunbeam's so-called ""plush"" heating pad and it fits nicely to my back. I have a 33 - 34 in waist and the belt fits me fine and I believe it would fit a larger person easily. Not to take anything away from the heating pad,  but I have to say if your waist is under 33 - 34 in. it's going to fit very loosely.  I have it cinched as far as it will go and it's not necessarily tight, but a comfortable fit. It would probably be snugger if i had a shirt or a sweat shirt on, but I'm not complaining.  I agree that it heats up pretty quickly, although I wish it were a bit hotter. Still, it's at least as hot as any Sunbeam product, of whom I've become increasingly frustrated with over the years. Sunbeam is not near as good as it used to be that they seem to just die right out of the box. The longevity of this heating pad remains to be seen, but at this price, if it outlasts my last several Sunbeam products I'm money ahead, especially if the manufacture makes good on the warranty: 5 years with a 365 day free replacement & 90 days free return. That adds up to a whole lot of happy for me. You can't touch a Sunbeam product like this for under forty dollars.  Believe me--I looked everywhere. Also, it shopped very quickly. It's eligible for free shipping. I ordered in on Saturday and got it on Monday. Best buying experience I've had for a long time. Even if I only get a year out of it--I would buy it again.

Okay, so I've had a 1TB Seagate External Hard Drive for years now, maybe five or so? And after lots of data transfers and moving it from computer to tv to laptop constantly and dropping it a bunch of times, it finally started to glitch on me. Since it lasted a long time and worked so great, I went for another Seagate with a lot more space.I had it for two weeks, and it worked fine. It was plugged into a desktop in an upstairs office, and I needed it downstairs for my laptop. So I went and grabbed it, but when I hit the second to last step coming down, my foot slid out from under me, and I went down to the ground, HARD. I landed flat on my front, and I had thrown my hands out to catch myself, which meant I slammed that hard drive flat on the ground with all my weight behind it. It then shot out from under my palm and slid across the floor, hitting a wall.I thought that was it. When I picked it up, the casing had come apart on one side, the chord had disconnected - no way this thing would ever work again. Plugged it into my laptop, and sure enough, it wouldn't read it. Neither of my laptops would, and neither of the TVs would. I thought I'd just smashed $115.The next day, though, I decided to give it one last shot, so I CAREFULLY went back upstairs and plugged it into the desktop. THANK GOD it worked - I assumed the desktop just had better ports and I quickly transferred all the data off it, while also reordering the drive again (along with a heavy duty one because I'm clumsy, obviously). Once it was empty, I reformatted it, and since it was working so well on the desktop, I transferred one of my videos back on to it, then took it back down to test on a TV.IT WORKED! I've since put more stuff on it, and thus far it's working FINE! Across ALL devices! Like ... what kind of wizardry is this!? I couldn't have been rougher on it if I'd literally thrown it at the ground, I slammed it that hard - and after just letting it sit for a night and then reformatting it, the drive works fine! I mean, I wouldn't trust it enough to store something on it without backing it up first, but thus far, it's like nothing happened to it.Based on that alone, I one million percent recommend this drive!ETA: When I got this product originally two weeks ago, it shipped in a plain, slim, brown box, inside a snug clear plastic container, with one little leaflet for an instructional manual. I was like okie dokie, whatever, as long as it works. Then I thought it was strange that when I went to reorder it, the black one would no longer ship to my address (I'm in Mexico), considering I'd just gotten it two weeks ago, but whatever, I just got the silver, color doesn't matter.It just arrived, and this silver version came in a very official looking product box, with the Seagate logo on it, and lots of instructions and special offers inside, all perfectly sealed with tamper-evident tape. Even the casing on the actual drive seems dramatically different.

First, it's powered from the Wally through the USB cable, so no external power supply is necessary. That's really handy for installation in my camper van's cabinetry; although I have 120v power available, that made for a neater, less bulky installation. The USB cable that came with it is short, but long enough that it fit my installation perfectly.Second, it's very compact. Again that made it handy for installation in my camper van's cabinetry, because it takes up next to no room in the A/V cabinet, tucked over to the side. Space in any camper van is at a premium, and I'm still able to store everything in the A/V cabinet that I had previously, because of the compact size of this hard drive.As I use this, I'll get a better handle on how well it works, and if anything happens that cause me to revisit this review, I'll amend it.","Easy to install to my Wally Dish receiver, with tech help from Dish",Color: BlackCapacity: 1TBStyle: Portable HDDVerified Purchase,,401,211,49980,Public

Other pluses include an operational light that is easy to see but not distracting and a reasonably compact size.  Operational speed has been more than acceptable on both USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. I didn't track the specific transfer rate, but it performed as well if not better than other USB drives I have.The only notable negative is the case. It's plastic, as expected, but rather flimsy feeling. This is not a drive that will withstand any measure of being knocked around.  An SSD drive would be a better choice if durability is the goal.This suits my needs perfectly as a very affordable, basic, everyday backup drive that will rarely leave the office. 4.5 stars (due to the plastic case which could have been better) but I'll round up to 5 since it does everything else very well at a reasonable price.",Good performance and value for the price,Color: BlackCapacity: 1TBStyle: Portable HDDVerified Purchase,,33740,4240,259,Public

The reason why I say not good for portability is because of the weight and design. For a hard drive it's quite heavy and as far as design goes the edges are very hard and sharp. You are not going to get a full 8 TB buy you will in fact get around 7. 27 TB which is crazy because that's a lot of storage that has to be used for this hard drive. Another thing to factor in is the heat. This hard drive heats up really fast so that's another thing to be concerned with.

Right out of the box, the write speed felt brutally slow. Moving files onto it took hours longer than it did with other external drives (using the same USB ports, etc). Once it was under heavy use, it started to fail, making loud thumping sounds and choking on fast downloads -- all downloads would lock up and fail. Through trial and error I figured out it was not my internet connection, but the hard drive that was causing this. Shortly after that it started giving me ""The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error"" messages. Not good Bob!Because it took me a couple weeks to start my archiving project, then another couple for it to fail, I'm outside the return window. I also needed to buy another drive of the same size to transfer all the files that were already on this soon-to-be-dead drive. The Western Digital I got? Cost less, smoother, quieter, faster.But now I'm out several hours of retransferring the files, plus time spent writing zeros to this drive before I return it.

I thought I was getting a pretty decent deal on a 2TB hard drive. For a while it seemed to work fine as a xbox one expansion. Eventually we started having issues getting the xbox to allow us to connect controllers to it. I did not even consider that this hard drive was to blame. We would have to restart the xbox a few times to get the connect button to function on the console.Finally we noticed that some of our content wasn't displaying on the console. I looked through the storage and noticed the external hard drive wasn't connecting anymore. Unplugged it, restarted console repeatedly. We tried everything. Finally we got it to connect and low and behold, the controller connect button no longer functions! I still assumed i was dealing with two separate issues.So about now I'm getting pretty frustrated with the whole situation. My external hard drive is trash, and my kid's less than year old xbox one x is apparently on the verge of becoming trash. I unplug the hard drive and move it to a different xbox to see if the storage or the xbox is to blame. Now imagine my surprise when the controller connect button on the second xbox now doesn't work. The hard drive doesn't work either. Everything works fine until I plug in this particular hard drive. And everything goes back to fine when I remove it.Do yourselves a favor and buy a better hard drive.Update - I have started the quest to see if it's possible to return this device back to whatever it came from. So far seagate has said it will not be a problem as long as I give them pretty much every piece of personal information that makes me who I am.

As a security guard I had access to every part of the building and I saw every test they put these things through before they are proud to call it a sea gate product they don’t cut any corners when it comes to testing these things in a variety of situations. I can’t go into any details due to the confidentiality clause I signed but I have no problems with dropping $130 for a 5 TB HDD that I have seen what it goes through before it gets the seagate logo put on it. The only complaint I have is the cable that came with my HDD was defective luckily I have several of them so it wasn’ta big issue for me personally.
