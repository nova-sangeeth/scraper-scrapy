Total Horror. The ""Easy"" Setup software couldn't complete the setup for the printer. Nothing to do with the wireless problems so many reviewers had. I had my printer connected via a USB CABLE! Even a direct Ethernet connection which I tried didn't work: in both cases, my computer was unable to ""locate HP's printer"". After hours spent on the HP website trying to find info to fix the problem myself, nothing that I found helped. AND GET THIS: no info is listed on their ""Support"" page to chat or telephone tech support (a real human being), only the worthless Virtual, so called ""Assistant."" But I got HP's number from Amazon, and called Monday. (No Tech Support on the weekends!) After Hours with them, they said I would have to contact Dell, for my USB and Ethernet ports needed to be upgraded (new Chip Set), although all of them work for EVERY OTHER DEVICE I have plugged in. ""No, there's no problem with the printer,"" they said ""The problem is your computer (fairly new---8.1). And THEN, when I finished with them, my Internet Connection no longer worked, although while I was with Tech, they had taken over my computer via the INTERNET! Called back. ""It's just a coincidence that your Internet went down,"" they told me. ""You need to call COMCAST to have it fixed."" Contact Dell and Comcast!? Damn, I't amazing they didn't tell me to talk to the Pope! Needless to say: I'm done. Getting refund. Also, beware, HP has it rigged now so that you can't use third-party inc cartridges. As far as Instant Ink, It might work for you, but I don't like them spying on my computer. You hit ""agree,"" and God-knows how much info they collect. Be sure to check that out.

The print quality was outstanding from the get-go, and I used it for everything from printing college term papers and business documents to printing artwork and photos. And in spite of its age--I bought it nearly 15 years ago--it was a real workhorse that just kept right on going no matter how much I threw at it. In fact, when I had to get rid of it, it still worked. So the problem wasn't the printer. The problem was Lexmark itself: the company apparently decided to get out of the printer business, and as of late 2018, I could no longer buy ink cartridges for my particular Lexmark model. So thus did my search for a new printer begin. And thus did enter this beauty, the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025. And I've gotta be honest: I'm not gonna miss my Lexmark. Not at all.The print quality of the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 is every bit as good as that of my former beloved printer. In fact, despite HP's early intimations that this small-business printer shouldn't be considered a photo printer, it actually does a beautiful job of printing photos (both on photo paper and on regular paper too). But in addition to printing, the OfficeJet Pro 8025 can also scan, function as a copy machine, and send faxes (if you have a landline). And unlike my old Lexmark, the OfficeJet Pro 8025 offers multiple means of connectivity, so in addition to being direct-connected to a single computer, this HP printer can also be shared via wi-fi, Bluetooth, or an Ethernet connection.Besides the outstanding print quality, there are three other things I really like about HP's OfficeJet Pro 8025. First off, the setup was easy as pie. All I did was turn the printer on, install the ink cartridges, and then connect the printer to my internet-enabled computer, and--voil√†!--the printer's drivers were immediately downloaded and installed in a snap. It truly is a plug-and-play device. (I must also note that even though the printer has a built-in scanner, its scanner drivers do not interfere at all with the drivers or functionality of my high-definition Canon scanner, which I need for my professional art and photography projects. Even during installation, the HP software was not presumptuous and never assumed that I wanted the HP scanner to become my default.) Secondly, there are separate ink cartridges for each color, as opposed to the more common practice of having the three primary colors combined into a single cartridge. This means that if I use a lot of one color--say cyan, for example--during a particular project and the cyan ink runs out, all I do is buy a new cyan cartridge; I do not have to waste the yellow and magenta ink (or the money I paid for them) by ditching a tricolor cartridge just because the cyan ran out. And finally, I love the paper feed on this unit. It holds 250 sheets of paper--half a ream--and that's gonna be very convenient for my small-business purposes. (The feeder on my old printer couldn't hold more than 25 sheets, by the way, so printing college term papers or, later, long business reports could be a real pain.)Now, even the best things have an issue or two, and that's also true of the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025. In this case, it has to do with disabling the printer's built-in wi-fi should you choose not to use it. I decided that I did not want to use the printer's wi-fi or network options and would instead just direct-connect the printer, via USB, to my main office desktop computer. (I never print from either of my laptops, and my wife has her own printer.) Thus, I went into the printer's settings and turned off the wi-fi, did my printing chores for the day, and then powered everything down. However, when I came back later in the evening to show off my new printer and let my wife take a gander, the printer's wi-fi automatically turned back on when the unit powered up, and worse, an annoying light on the front of the printer started flashing to warn me of the wi-fi's not-connected status. So I manually turned the wi-fi off again, of course, but when I turned the printer off and then back on just to see what would happen, the wi-fi was again automatically enabled (along with its annoying status light). I spent a couple of hours doing some research to see if there is a way to disable the wi-fi permanently, but so far I've found nothing that works, so it looks like I will either have to manually disable the wi-fi every time I fire up the printer or I'll just have to learn to ignore the flashing wi-fi status light. Considering the printer's overall quality, though, this is a minor issue (and one I can live with).All in all, the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 has thus far proven to be an outstanding printer. The printer's image quality is at a professional level, the unit is speedy, it's multifunctional (that is, it does more than just print), and it has many other features that make it perfect for a home office or a small business. Of course, its somewhat steep price reflects the fact that the printer is intended for small-business use, but nonetheless, I think I'd still also recommend it to anyone looking for a quality printer for basic home use. Since this unit can be connected to multiple computers via wi-fi, Bluetooth, or an Ethernet port on a network router, and since the printer has a large-capacity paper feed, the whole family could easily share. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 is smartly designed and made of high-quality materials, so I have no doubt it will stand up to the needs of either a small business or a big family.",Great Quality and Functionality for the Small Business or the Home Office,Style: PrinterVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? ),73 people found this helpful,5615,348,442971,Public

The print quality was outstanding from the get-go, and I used it for everything from printing college term papers and business documents to printing artwork and photos. And in spite of its age--I bought it nearly 15 years ago--it was a real workhorse that just kept right on going no matter how much I threw at it. In fact, when I had to get rid of it, it still worked. So the problem wasn't the printer. The problem was Lexmark itself: the company apparently decided to get out of the printer business, and as of late 2018, I could no longer buy ink cartridges for my particular Lexmark model. So thus did my search for a new printer begin. And thus did enter this beauty, the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025. And I've gotta be honest: I'm not gonna miss my Lexmark. Not at all.The print quality of the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 is every bit as good as that of my former beloved printer. In fact, despite HP's early intimations that this small-business printer shouldn't be considered a photo printer, it actually does a beautiful job of printing photos (both on photo paper and on regular paper too). But in addition to printing, the OfficeJet Pro 8025 can also scan, function as a copy machine, and send faxes (if you have a landline). And unlike my old Lexmark, the OfficeJet Pro 8025 offers multiple means of connectivity, so in addition to being direct-connected to a single computer, this HP printer can also be shared via wi-fi, Bluetooth, or an Ethernet connection.Besides the outstanding print quality, there are three other things I really like about HP's OfficeJet Pro 8025. First off, the setup was easy as pie. All I did was turn the printer on, install the ink cartridges, and then connect the printer to my internet-enabled computer, and--voil√†!--the printer's drivers were immediately downloaded and installed in a snap. It truly is a plug-and-play device. (I must also note that even though the printer has a built-in scanner, its scanner drivers do not interfere at all with the drivers or functionality of my high-definition Canon scanner, which I need for my professional art and photography projects. Even during installation, the HP software was not presumptuous and never assumed that I wanted the HP scanner to become my default.) Secondly, there are separate ink cartridges for each color, as opposed to the more common practice of having the three primary colors combined into a single cartridge. This means that if I use a lot of one color--say cyan, for example--during a particular project and the cyan ink runs out, all I do is buy a new cyan cartridge; I do not have to waste the yellow and magenta ink (or the money I paid for them) by ditching a tricolor cartridge just because the cyan ran out. And finally, I love the paper feed on this unit. It holds 250 sheets of paper--half a ream--and that's gonna be very convenient for my small-business purposes. (The feeder on my old printer couldn't hold more than 25 sheets, by the way, so printing college term papers or, later, long business reports could be a real pain.)Now, even the best things have an issue or two, and that's also true of the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025. In this case, it has to do with disabling the printer's built-in wi-fi should you choose not to use it. I decided that I did not want to use the printer's wi-fi or network options and would instead just direct-connect the printer, via USB, to my main office desktop computer. (I never print from either of my laptops, and my wife has her own printer.) Thus, I went into the printer's settings and turned off the wi-fi, did my printing chores for the day, and then powered everything down. However, when I came back later in the evening to show off my new printer and let my wife take a gander, the printer's wi-fi automatically turned back on when the unit powered up, and worse, an annoying light on the front of the printer started flashing to warn me of the wi-fi's not-connected status. So I manually turned the wi-fi off again, of course, but when I turned the printer off and then back on just to see what would happen, the wi-fi was again automatically enabled (along with its annoying status light). I spent a couple of hours doing some research to see if there is a way to disable the wi-fi permanently, but so far I've found nothing that works, so it looks like I will either have to manually disable the wi-fi every time I fire up the printer or I'll just have to learn to ignore the flashing wi-fi status light. Considering the printer's overall quality, though, this is a minor issue (and one I can live with).All in all, the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 has thus far proven to be an outstanding printer. The printer's image quality is at a professional level, the unit is speedy, it's multifunctional (that is, it does more than just print), and it has many other features that make it perfect for a home office or a small business. Of course, its somewhat steep price reflects the fact that the printer is intended for small-business use, but nonetheless, I think I'd still also recommend it to anyone looking for a quality printer for basic home use. Since this unit can be connected to multiple computers via wi-fi, Bluetooth, or an Ethernet port on a network router, and since the printer has a large-capacity paper feed, the whole family could easily share. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 is smartly designed and made of high-quality materials, so I have no doubt it will stand up to the needs of either a small business or a big family.",Great Quality and Functionality for the Small Business or the Home Office,Style: PrinterVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? ),73 people found this helpful,5615,348,442971,Public

I was looking for a printer and scanner that I could use that would be easy to use, as well as affordable. The HP Officejet 8025 All-in-One wireless printer has marked all the boxes. First the affordability of the ink is amazing, the HP instant ink program not only saves me time, but also money. I no longer have to make a trip to the store to purchase ink, HP automatically send it before I even think I need it. Also the cost for this program is much cheaper than buying the cartridges from those Mega stores. Another great feature is the ability to print from my phone. Many times I am not at my computer, but I received a communication from a parent or another teacher that I need to print. I no longer have to log into to my computer and download the communication to print. I can print it from my phone using the mobile print feature. One of the best features is being able to use it for those one or two copies that I need. I no longer have to leave my room to make an extra copy of a worksheet for a student. I can now use my HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 All-in-One Wireless Printer to scan and print the required document and give to the student in the fraction of the time it would normally take. The quality of the print is excellent, and it take very little time for it to complete the print jobs as previous printers would have a lag time",Great Classroom Printer,Style: PrinterVerified Purchase,42 people found this helpful,42,2,3327896,Public

In all my years in IT this was the worst printer to install I have ever come across. First you have to log into your microsoft account, then log into your HP account just to get the setup going. Then it craps out halfway thru the install on some HP webpage failure. Wanted to connect with USB and use Wifi-Direct  for mobile device printing. Had to monkey around with that for over an hour to finally get it to work. At one point to set up Wifi-Direct it said to check back in 2 hours because it usually takes that long for it to get everything set up. REALLY, 2 HOURS!  I can't imagine a non-IT person setting up this printer. Finally after I got it to work with USB connection and Wifi-Direct, discovered it would not scan from printer to PC. It was giving an error message on printer screen that it was not connected to my PC. Yet I could print to in from my PC. Then discovered I could scan to the PC from the printer if I initiated the scan from the PC. Had to search all around HP site to find out I had to download drivers to get it to scan to PC initiated from the printer. Through this whole whole process you had to first download HP SMART app to PC which is supposed to do all the setup , which I would have thought included downloading the necessary drivers for scanning, etc. I believe the correct app name should have been HP DUMB. This turned into a 4 hour install for a cheap $100 printer. If buyers of this printer, and I'm sure other HP printers, that don't have a Microsoft account or an HP account; they will end up with both if they want to install this printer. After all this frustration, HP puts a large, ugly sticker on top of the printer reminding you to buy HP ink. After taking the sticker off I spent 30 minutes trying to get the glue residue off with rubbing alcohol and still can get it all off.

Basically with every ink printer on the market, they want to give you the printer next to free in hopes you'll spend a small fortune on ink. That's why you see some companies such as Lexmark folding on selling inkjet printers - margins are too low. And that's why you see such a low page count on the ink that comes with the printer - it's just enough to get you started so you have to buy more ink.So when purchasing a printer, all the silly little features they like to advertise are rather meaningless unless you really do need that touch screen or whatever. What matters is how well it prints (remember the days when a cell phone was measured by the quality of calls and not how well it took a picture?) and host costly the ink is over time. HP does a fair job on cost/page for their ink, although they try to sucker you into monthly services for ink and all kinds of crap. Apparently, gone are the days of just buying a printer and being able to print without big brother watching you print, analyzing your print habits and trying to sell you crap in your own home/business.My last printer was working fine and had about 7 years on it. What was becoming difficult was finding ink and driver support with Microshaft's poor Windows development. Around the same time, my father needed a printer and since I'm his tech support, I thought I'd buy 2 of the same kind to ease support. There's good and bad here.The good side of this printer is that it was very easy to set up. As with so many things now, there's a mobile app to set up the device. Yet another way to peer into your privacy, although few give it any consideration these days. I had the printer set up on wireless and connected to multiple PCs in under 20 minutes.The Windows software is a bit crappy and somewhat confusing in some places on what was going on. The first thing I wanted to do was turn off all the marketing crap (I don't need monthly ink service) and spying on me (HP does not need to know when and how much I print). They did keep some of that hidden well, so the average user won't just go ah, there are the spyware settings.Print quality on this printer is quite good. I've been very pleased with text being crisp and close to laser quality. I do not bother with photo printing at home considering the cost of photo paper and then the ink. Helpful hint here is to visit your local Walmart and get prints made much easier and likely cheaper unless you're doing a lot of scrapbooks.The worst downside on this printer is how slow it is to finally print something. I don't need to print every single day and apparently this printer gets a chip on its shoulder about it. When I do print, it goes into some kind of maintenance where it hums and acts like it is thinking hard about life. After 5 minutes or so, it finally spits out that precious page. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and guessing maybe it does something to the nozzles to prevent the ink from drying up and then has to do something to get started back up again. I'm rarely in a rush, so it's not the end of the world - just confusing when you don't know for sure what it is doing.For the price, this is about as good as it gets though. Once up and going, it's pretty hassle free. I'd recommend it and would likely purchase again.","Easy to set up, slowest printer to print",Style: PrinterVerified Purchase,11 people found this helpful,376,123,106492,Public

When the printer is opened up to replace cartridges or add paper, everything fits and eventually snaps back into place but only after carefully and painstakingly effort.  This is a ""price point"" printer built to be cheap enough to hit a price point such that quality is compromised;2) the integration with Apple's latest Catalina software is very problematic which is an issue with both Apple and HP.  There are workarounds for the scanner that stops working when Catalina is installed but they are a little convoluted and were discovered by HP customers who posted solutions on the HP website rather than HP itself who has demonstrated that customers are not very important.  If you think this is hyperbole, Google ""Printer driver for new Mac OS 10.15, Catalina"" that literally contains hundreds and hundreds of posts to the HP Support Community (part of the HP printer website) that recounts story after story of HP's abject failure to provide minimal customer support.The big take-away is that if you buy this printer and have problems like so many of us, you are absolutely on your own.  HP won't help you.3) My latest frustration is that the printer refuses to connect to my WiFi.  I have now spent a couple of hours trying to get this to work but I have had it.  I plan on literally throwing this printer away and buying another printer from any manufacturer other than HP.In summary, a one star review of this printer and HP is too generous!OLD REVIEW: If you plan on using this printer with the latest Apple OS software, Catalina, good luck.  HP has made no drivers available to make the scan function work. Worse, instead of plainly telling the customer that they don't have such a driver, much less when they are going to get one, they lead you on a wild goose chase from one HP web page to another to conclude, guess what, that they have no way of making the printer work with the latest Apple software.  This product should be purchased by masochists only or hardened felons convicted of the most heinous crimes!Original Review:I replaced another HP printer that inexplicably just stopped working.  I ordered this as a replacement via Amazon and was immediately struck by the flimsy construction of this printer that was obviously made to fit a price point.  I wish I had paid more money to get a more durable machine.  This new printer hasn't failed me but I am concerned that when I sneeze, that might cause it to stop working.

On some level, they are pretty much useless.  Perhaps this is intentional, to distract reviewers from the real issues with this printer, and potential customers to some serious quality concerns.  So, it prints.  So far, it prints fairly well, but no more or less well than other printers in this category.  The tech support is tolerable, and the touch screen works insofar as a touchscreen works.  None of this is really relevant.First, this is a fairly big printer, so be aware of this.  It is a home office printer, with emphasis on the ""office"" part of this description.  Secondly, out of the box, my wife pointed out that the armature that holds the printing inks was loose and rattled.  On inspection, I noticed that it was missing a screw, so was basically just floating around on one end.  Luckily, I had a screw that matched the size and threading of the original, and was able to fix this fairly painlessly.Then, we were excited because the HP website informed us that we didn't have to download any drivers to make the printer work, and our first printings seemed to confirm this, until.... we tried to scan something.  We placed the image to be scanned in the scanner, and pushed the touchscreen to scan, and it told us that we needed to go to HP's website to download some drivers.  So, we did that, and we were informed that the printer didn't need drivers, so now we're on the phone trying to figure out which is right.  So, maybe the touchscreen doesn't work so well after all, or the website doesn't work so well, which means that ultimately both need to take a hit in terms of rating.I bought this printer because of all of the printers that I was reviewing, this had the highest rating and the best reviews, and maybe, in the end, we received the lemon and should have just boxed it back up and returned it as soon as we realized that it was missing a screw.

I guess(?) it works ok. It prints fast at least. I print maybe a page or two a day on average, not what I would call high-use. Usually a recipe, return receipts from amazon, or stuff like that. I ordered this thing in late June, had to replace the color ink in July, black ink in September, and now in October my color is low again.And you know why? The ink jets never stay clean. Randomly, one color will shut off or start missing lines. Then I have to run it through a minimum of 2 ink-intensive cleaning cycles. Once it took five cycles to get magenta ink flowing. Just today the magenta ink jet is missing lines again, prompting me to rage-review this piece of junk.There's a non-stop effort to get me to sign up for automatic ink delivery where you pay per page you print. I thank almighty God every day I keep turning that down because it's expensive enough going through all my ink running test prints. I can't imagine that if HP was watching over me and remotely charging me per page.Edit: It's now been four months--well past the return period--and I've had it with this printer. Still has the ink issue. Ten days after writing the original review (and one month after replacing the black ink), the black ink head started making lines and the color just decided it didn't want to work, so back to the cleaning cycle. You can see I went through four cleaning cycles this time, but it never got fully clean... because it used up the last of my color ink in cleaning cycles. See pictures of attempt to print kid's Spanish homework and subsequent cleaning attempts.Days when we do try to print I'd say there's a 50/50 chance it either creates a paper jam or it just inexplicably stops midway through the job (and no we are not closing our laptops while it is printing) or the paper prints but remains inside the machine. Today I opened it to fix yet another paper jam, and to access the catch in the back you have to open the scan tray. Well, the scan tray is weighted so that bumping the printer while trying to muscle out the paper caused the tray to literally rip off, yanking its cord with it. See photo. I'm done, done, DONE with this printer that has been nothing but a headache since we got it.I mean, for a machine that is just supposed to work in the background (who thinks about their printer? It should just ""work,"" right?), I've spent too much time and energy on this piece of junk.

If I go more than a few days without printing it has to perform ""maintenance"" before it will print anything, which is using up ink. Every so often then it will print like crap, but after 2-3 cleanings magically prints perfectly. I shouldn't have to clean print heads weekly. I did it annually on my last printer. I have printed less than 10 pages with my current color cartridges, only partial color mind you (graph, table, figure or two) and somehow they are at about 25%.  I can accept the greed, it's the ugly side of capitalism, but this is just excessive. Otherwise it prints fairly well, though not as high quality as I expected it to. Also have problems with it feeding. Two out of three times the last printed page is stuck in the printer and I have to slowly pull it out so it doesn't rip. I like the wifi and bluetooth features, but especially the auto 2-sided printing and feed tray that I can just drop a load of papers in for scanning.

I'm replacing an OfficeJet 4500 that I've had since 2011 and just recently started to make this loud clacking noise before it would print. It also started to give me less than good quality printouts so I replaced it with the HP OfficeJet 8025 which is essentially the same as the 8035 except that the 8035 has a different ink-purchase plan and it comes in different colors. The 8025 comes in white and basalt (gray).With my former HP printers, I had to use CD's or the internet to upload all the software. This line of printers does it automatically with the computer and also from a smartphone using the HP Smart App and the HP Print Service Plug-in for Android.One thing I would avoid doing is using the machine to clean the cartridges. With my former printer, I noticed a lot of dried, built-up ink inside it where the cleaning sponges are and my attempt to clean it out probably caused the noise that prompted me to replace the printer in the first place. So keep an eye on any ink build up where the ink cartridge carrier rests.Another caveat is the lid. On my former printer, the hinge didn't hold so well. In fact it broke off and I had to use duct tape to fix it and place something behind the lid to keep it from breaking off again. Keep an eye on that too.  I think things like that are planned obsolescence.It does accept wired as well as a wireless connection. There doesn't seem to be a ""cancel"" button. Try canceling from the computer instead. It does Print, Copy, Scan and Fax. It also sleeps after 5 minutes of idle time.UPDATE: After using it for two weeks, it does tend to run out of toner ink fairly fast. I suggest getting the XL sized ink when replacing or if you make a lot of print-outs, use HP's ink replacement program.Also, keep an eye inside where the ink is.

I was impressed with the speed of the print, it's not slow, but not the fastest, but decent speed.I do wish the tray was slightly easier to pull out, and there is a piece above the tray that can come out.

It feels like the plastic shell and hinges for the scanner tray (when lifted) will break after about 6 months of use or so.
