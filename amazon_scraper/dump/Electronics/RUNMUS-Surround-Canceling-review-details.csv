They are bulky, strong, soft on the ears, beautiful, top quality for the dollar.The sound: It does not oversell the surround sound, you will hear everything from every direction as if you were in the battlefield of the badlands. The quality of sound is beautiful as well, not muffling or diluting despite size, crisp and fresh. Noise cancellation? You'll be able to hear enough outside to make sure no one is going to play a game of SAW with you but give you peace of mind. Want more control of volume? No sweat, it comes with a small volume wheel.The mic: Wonderful work of art. Ignores outside sounds (except mechanical keyboard clicks of a certain type, those are loud.) You will be heard clearly, you will be clearly understandable and able to communicate with the most effect compared to other headsets, and is good at making sure only you are heard. Need to insta-mute that mic? It comes with a button that turns it off before anyone can hear what's going on.How does it feel? It surrounds and cups the ear, instead of pressing tightly against the tips and giving those horrible headaches. It gives your ears breathing room and the protein foam for the top of your skull is so pleasant that you can easily forget it's even there. The mic is comfortable to move around without getting in my way. Out of mind, the only thing you'll focus on is the sound blessing your ears. Want to wear it for three days in a row in your chair without visiting the bathroom and having a system of snacks and drinks at your desk for that ultimate WoW session? Go right ahead, it won't feel any different than when you put it on to begin with.Will they break easily? NO. These things are built like tanks for your skull, if you drop it, it will brush it off and laugh at the poor attempt to even crack it. This thing might even be a good tool for self defense with how strong it is, these aren't poor quality materials.How does it look? It looks like you're about to perform an impossible feat on your new favorite game. It's beautifully designed, has a red glare that will bring fear into your fellow gaming buddies when you hear their every breath in the game. They are equipped for any situation, they are scary to be against, and highly fashionable to show off and brag to your fellow gamers on Twitch and Steam. They are thick, but that makes this beast seem even bigger and more dominating than those sad little Skullcandy mobile headphones.What can I use it on? If it has either a USB port or can take those little round plugs, congratulations, this works on it. PC is what I use it on, but if I wanted to I could use it on any other single device a gamer could ever imagine using. Even old systems take this beast and let them in, it is perfect.Price vs Quality: Anything that claims to be better will either be a liar or something extraordinarily developed and thus be very costly. This competes with other more costly ""top rated"" headphones. This packs the features, the looks, the comfort, and the durability all for a considerable price that anyone would be right to simply choose this on first sight. I almost was a foolish mortal and thought about others, but no, I made the right choice to take this set and buy it. If it ever breaks I will be surprised and heartbroken. It has improved everything in my games, I cannot possibly appreciate any headphones more than this.You will regret not knowing what beauty is here before you by buying some lame headset for more of a price, because I feel very comfortable that this one will certainly out compete it without a SINGLE QUESTION. Buy it sooner than later, TREAT YOURSELF. I will be getting another for my brother without a doubt.",The mic is perfect,Color: RedVerified Purchase,"1,047 people found this helpful"

People usually start with the pros, so here are the cons first:CONS:1.) Your ears get warm playing for any length of time which I'm getting used to. In comparison to my bro's headset, the earcups around the ear don't even touch your ear, giving ventilation to the ear to keep it cool.2.) It's wired, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but the wire is just over 6 feet in length and can get caught on things when you're moving it. Maybe the long wire would be good for the XboxOne (IDK), but for the Playstation 4 all you need to do is plug it directly into the controller, and it automatically connects to the system, so you'd only maybe need half the length that they give you. My bro's headset is wireless.That's it for the cons, as for the pros:PROS:1.)  Comfortable. It's heavily padded around the ears and the top of the headset where it rests on your head. I've worn this for 5 or 6 hours straight, and it still felt extremely comfortable. My bro's headset is similarly comfortable, maybe slightly better, but not by much.2.) The sound is great. My brother's headset claims 3D sound with amazing clarity, but in comparison, I've found that there isn't a great difference (if any!) with this headset and his own.3.) The microphone works crisp, even though I only sometimes hear echos of myself through other people's TV's, I've told they're clear by other players.4.) I've only owned this headset for two weeks, but feels well made, and you can definitely tell they built it smart, even though there's a lot of hard plastic covering the expensive materials, it's sturdy. However, if I were to compare it with my bro's headset, there would be a measurable difference between the two in weight and materials used (on the outside). Like I said, the inside seems like the best part (which is the part that matters, I believe).So, if you're looking for a $28 dollar headset, then get this one. If you're wanting to spend $100+ dollars on a headset, you can find some marginally better in almost every way. Just depends if you want to spend another $80 dollars, or if you want to get a good quality product from a seemingly smart respectable company.",It's a better product than you'd expect for the price,Color: RedVerified Purchase,606 people found this helpful

I had been using little earbuds, which worked but would end up hurting my ears after the first hour of playing. I decided that since I was playing so much, I should invest in some headphones. I looked at a lot of different brands and read a lot of reviews. As I said, I was never much of a gamer, so I had no idea what I should be looking for. After searching for a few weeks, I came across the K2 Pro gaming headset.This headset is perfect; the mic is clear and doesn’t pick up any other noise. My friends say it is clear, and there is no background noise. The best part is when playing first-person shooter games, I can hear the footsteps in front, behind, left, and right of me before anyone else can. I am able to let my squad know where someone is coming before they light us up. One of my favorite features is being able to control the volume and the mic so easily. Times when I do not want to talk or when I go into game chat to listen to others, it makes it easy to switch my mic on and off.Even though I do not have different gaming headphones to compare these to, I have used my old beats headphones for a bit, and these are 100% better than those when gaming. I am impressed, and every gamer should get a pair. I am even trying to get my friends to buy a pair so that they can enhance their gaming to a new level.I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone hardcore gamer to the occasional gamer. The price is fantastic for the quality. I would buy these over and over again.",These raise your gaming experience to a new level,Color: RedVerified Purchase,789 people found this helpful

I had been using little earbuds, which worked but would end up hurting my ears after the first hour of playing. I decided that since I was playing so much, I should invest in some headphones. I looked at a lot of different brands and read a lot of reviews. As I said, I was never much of a gamer, so I had no idea what I should be looking for. After searching for a few weeks, I came across the K2 Pro gaming headset.This headset is perfect; the mic is clear and doesn’t pick up any other noise. My friends say it is clear, and there is no background noise. The best part is when playing first-person shooter games, I can hear the footsteps in front, behind, left, and right of me before anyone else can. I am able to let my squad know where someone is coming before they light us up. One of my favorite features is being able to control the volume and the mic so easily. Times when I do not want to talk or when I go into game chat to listen to others, it makes it easy to switch my mic on and off.Even though I do not have different gaming headphones to compare these to, I have used my old beats headphones for a bit, and these are 100% better than those when gaming. I am impressed, and every gamer should get a pair. I am even trying to get my friends to buy a pair so that they can enhance their gaming to a new level.I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone hardcore gamer to the occasional gamer. The price is fantastic for the quality. I would buy these over and over again.",These raise your gaming experience to a new level,Color: RedVerified Purchase,789 people found this helpful

They were a cursed brand for me, I always broke the jack. I went through three, lol. I bought these due to the fact I was getting tied of just using skull candy earbuds for my Xbox. I found this nice headset that can be used for my PC and Xbox, at a lower cost too, so I figured, why not?- Sound Quality  The quality I am very satisfied with, including its 7.1 surround sound capabilities. It helps me in FPS shooters like Siege trying to listen for enemies. The bass in it sounds pretty good, but when I ""Good"" its noticeable but I like me a hearty bass from deep within my heart... Otherwise the sounds are really nice and no complaints from there.-  Comfort?  The pads on the Ears and across the scalp are actually quite comfy.  If you no life some games for like 8+ hours, its understandable when your ears are tired of being pushed back a little, so mine are small enough to tuck a bit into the speaker areal. That's where as a personal request if there could be a foam padding between the speaker and the mesh that covers it, for those who have small ears. I don't have much say, as the producer are the engineers...- Summary  Good for when you're trying for a starter gaming headset... The sound does work without the USB plugged in, you just wont get ya fancy lights. This does work with just the jack in the Xbox One S, as it is a newer controller and not needing the adapter.

These are very comfortable and are more enjoyable than listening to my PS4 through my surround sound speakers.

I went into my settings to try and fix it, maybe turn down the sensitivity or change the audio format.

Materials are sturdy, primarily made of a thick plastic or a TPU. Sound quality is excellent, and the microphone is loud and clear, picking up only the voice of the player. Aesthetics are nice, the volume/mute functions are great, and the sound separation for picking up footsteps in shooters is awesome!But not exactly what I'm looking for...The only con I can say is comfort. It is not extremely uncomfortable, but my ears and some parts of my head felt still and a little sore after a gaming session. The padding on this headset is excellent all around, but the ear cups are not angled for my head specifically, I'd like more tilt on the ear cups for a better, more comfortable fit and feel. Also, this headset is about as heavy as other headsets (if not, heavier), but the distribution of weight made it uncomfortable for longer gaming sessions.Overall, I enjoyed this headset for the time being, but essentially I'm going to go with another option on the market.

I cannot comment on that, as I didn't look into their offer, but they do have a card offering products, or a $15 amazon gift card for reviewing their product.Hmmm, I'm always looking for exceptional value, but I mostly get disappointed. So far, this is the case with these.First impressions: They are pretty well engineered for $27. Even so, they have an unidentifiable, slightly cheap appearence. The more I look them over, this impression seems to dissipate, and I'm getting over it. I think its possibly the appearance of micAppearence: The fit and finish is generally nice. The chrome bits are done well. All the parts fit tightly together. They seem well thought out, except that they are pretty large. The first thing my wife said, was to ask me if I was directing air traffic. The strain reliefs slightly cheapen the appearence,  but I overlook that, because its better to have them, than not.Comfort/Ergonomics:They fit nicely on my head, which isfairly large. I can't imagine many heads that would be too large, as each cup has about another 1"" or so of travel. The extentions have a nice ""clicky"" adjustments that should stay put.The cups are pretty large in diameter, and fit easily around my average sized ears. The cups aren't terribly deep considering the size, if your ears stick out, it could potentially pose a problem,  my ears just barely clear. A slight push, and they touch.The cups are soft and cushy, and I expect they will be comfortable for long sessions. I'll update on that. Same with the headband pad, which is nice and deep and soft.They are generally light enough.The mic can be rotated up and out of the way, and has detents to keep it well positioned. The mic boom is plenty rigid, and can bent in, or away from your mouth.Sound:The reason for 3 stars at this point is the sound. It's maybe a bit better than one would expect for the cost, but its still lacking. The bass is okay, more than expected, but not very punchy. There is something missing above the bass region, they are kind of lifeless, especially for music, which I know isn't their purpose. It's sort of like you're under water.  I'm guessing this will show in game play, like hearing enemies well. Another thing I will report on, and adjust my rating. There may or may not be a little change with break in.

I currently use the HyperX Cloud X’s for my Xbox, and they are amazing! Sound quality is GREAT, and I’m on my 2nd pair, after beating my other ones up for 3yrs. With that said, Hyper X headsets aren’t cheap, and when I started playing my PS4 again, I needed another headset, so I found these RUNMUS headsets, and the reviews weren’t bad. The Hyper X headset worked, but I hated having to rearrange my set up and swap headsets with controllers, laziness 100%.I’ve had these for almost a week, and I am just not satisfied with them at all. The sound quality is decent, but the non-comfort and bulkiness of the headset outweighs the sound. Also, the adjustable sides are cheap plastic, so one side of my headset arrived out of position, and won’t go down the entire way. They don’t adjust smoothly, so I’ve kind of just keep them at their original position, for fear they would breakPROSsound quality is clear and crisp, but that’s to be expected with noise canceling headsets.CONSHUGE/BULKY: They feel like they weigh my head down.TOO TIGHT! These push against the side of my head and give me a headache. They also push my glasses into the side of my face, and are extremely uncomfortable after 1/2hr of playing.The CORD setup: The volume/mute section is bulky, and awkward. There are extra pieces just hanging around when using it with a controller, so it’s annoying to have those extra things just hanging around and in my way, on my lap.I would not recommend this headset for adults, or for gamers who play for extended periods of time, they just aren’t quality enough to fit the standards of comfort, or performance. For children, maybe they would be better, as kids break things, these are cheap, and perhaps would be a good starter pair for a kid.One last thing to mention. I think it’s stupid to have lights on a headset, making them compatible with controllers/consoles, and then only making the lights work when using them with a PC. That just seems like a huge waste! The lights are nice, but they are absolutely worthless to me at this point.Definitely spend money on a better headset, you won’t regret your choice to spend a little extra money for quality.","TOO Cheap, better for starter headset FOR KIDS.",Color: RedVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

This headset had excellent reviews, and plenty of them, so I thought it was time to finally retire my old pair and get some new, crisp, clear sounding headphones. I've been considering getting a new pair for over a year now, but the PS4 gold headset is top notch sound, and I've yet to find another headset that beats them out. Well, that statement still stands.I was excited when the delivery was made for this headset. Boy was I excited. I finished my work for the day, plugged them in, and spun up a game which conveniently has a pretty dynamic main menu soundtrack, so I was ready for a concert. Then I heard the truth. I audibly said ""Wow, this is garbage"" and sat staring with my face contorted in disgust for a solid minute before plugging my old faithful PS4 gold headset in. Mind you, this is also all happening on a PC. I use the PS4 gold headset on both gaming platforms. When I switched back to my old headset, the sound difference was shocking. I know this is a cheaper headset than the PS4 gold by far, but I was given the gold headset as a gift, and today I learned how much the price makes a difference. The bass is WAY overbearing, and it sounds so artificial it's literally painful to listen to. This set will be returned immediately.

I searched a while at some high end sets and being an avid gamer i was willing to invest into a $200 wireless model, but decided to give these a shot first with an option to return. I was impressed to say the least! I'm not certain if the sound it 7.1, honestly cause i never have heard 7.1 headphones -  but i can hear things coming behind me and beside me without issues! These things are big, but light weight, the materials are solid but flexible. the mic drop has a small satisfying click each movement down and the cord was plenty to reach my pc and still have wire left to move around after spazing out over getting killed ha! Its not all rainbows and sunshine.... the LED light is useless, to me atleast, and needs to be powered by USB. The cord aforementioned is long, which is great for PC but a pain in the tuckus for xbox or switch. The adapter/volume in-line with the braided cable is heavy and awkward, so much so that when it drops from the table or my lap i can feel the tug on my headset. the set comes with a mic\audio Y cable too, which was a nice addition although i didn't need it. All in all i am thoroughly impressed with these, especially at the price point. I explore many headphones and speakers for value and sound, to me its what makes brands like aiwa or anker so stellar. when you roll the dice on off-brand devices you typically roll snakeyes but every once in a while you stumble across that gem -  this is that gem. if youre in the market for great sounding and a solid mic headset for xbox\ps\nintendo AND PC -  this is an absolute steal. if your in the market for a headset for just xbox\ps -  this is an absolute steal.

While I haven't tried them yet for extended sessions (4hrs+), I can tell that I'm going to have no issue with them whatsoever.

I was hoping that I could use these for PC gaming with just a USB connection but sadly, that is not the case. For a desktop computer they need to be connected to a USB (for the lights, I assume), 3.5mm mic jack, and 3.5mm headphone jack. This seems very excessive and unnecessary and actually disables me from being able to use these on my laptop as the headphone jack is on the opposite side of my USB ports.Overall, wonderful quality and I'm sure it's exceptional for console gaming if you're okay with two additional wires dangling, but please consider your port setup on PC before purchasing.",Great Quality Headphones with Subpar Jack/Port Setup,Color: RedVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Namely, the braided cable not being very secure into connectors, the braid has come out and frayed, leaving only the bare wires holding on to the connection.

I said omg, that’s why this thing has so many good reviews!! I thought I just got scammed. Of course, I too wanted that free gift so I left a review before I really even gave them a try.

I was a little surprised at the attractive style and comfortable fit of this headset - even though it is a little heavier than other headsets that I have had in the past.2. It has a robust, sturdy cord that will probably stand the test of time.3. The headset cable is wired with a split between USB connection and audio jack. Great idea.4. They include an optional audio splitter connector to separate the sound line from the microphone (useful for some computers).5. The LED (I got red) on the side is attractive and no overly bright at night.6. The ear pads fit very comfortably over the ears - no more of that pinching or pressing pains after hours of play.Disappointments right out of the box:1. The USB did not work with three different computers that I tried (Mac, Win10, and Win8) or my XBox. The device was not recognized on any of these systems. I emailed Run Mus about it a couple times over several days, but never received a response.2. The sound with the split sound/microphone jack connected to my computer would have lots of static and crackles.3. The microphone did not work at all.4. When plugging the single audio jack into my iPhone to test the headset, the sound would cut out every few seconds and sometimes it would trigger the ""Siri"" as if it was emulating the Home button push on the iPhone. It fits tightly, but may have a slight offset that causes it to engage some of the iPhone functions.5. I tried the audio jack in one of my Xbox controllers, which is outfitted with a standard audio jack output. I could only get sound out one of the earpieces and no microphone.6. I did not notice any sound canceling whatsoever. It's possible that the static sounds were attempting to do the sound cancellation, but it definitely wasn't working.","Good padding, Fair sound, Slightly heavier than similar headsets, USB and microphone didn't work",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

The sound quality is robust and immersive. It works just as well for music as it does for gaming. The amount of bass exceeded my expectations as well. The headset is fairly lightweight and rather comfortable, so after a few minutes of wearing them, they almost seem to disappear. The mic sounds good too. I tested by recording my voice then playing it back and I was pleased with crispness of the playback. They also don't seem too loud for others nearby. I tried listening to music at a comfortable volume and my wife couldn't hear it from only a few feet away.I bought these for use with a PC and PS4. The cord is long so you have plenty of room to move around. The cord also has a Velcro strap attached to it so you can bunch up some of the length if you don't want it dangling (which is nice when using the PS4 since you are plugged into the controller so you don't need all that length). You will need to plug in the USB connector if you want to LEDs to light up. This means you can't effectively have the LEDs lit up when gaming with a PS4 (this is not something I care about personally) since there is no USB plug on the controller itself.Overall, for the quality at this price, I see no reason to spend more money on another headset. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a good gaming headset.",Solid Quality,Color: RedVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Except, great gaming headsets are spendy. Plus reviews weren't very strong and constant for me to fork over big amounts of cash. Durability and sound are definately at the top of the list. Why pay a lot for a headset that doesn't last? So after doing research I decided to try out my Run Mus gaming headset. What I got was a very hefty (size) and pretty lightweight headset that lights up because I spend hours in a room by myself but I gotta have cool lights with very thick covered cords that are very long. It definately looks the part for the fraction of the price. I am still in the process of my first week of usage and the break in period. What I can tell you after 4 days is that my old headset was definately worn out. I am finally getting used to these and the experience and quality is pretty solid at the price point for these. It comes down to usage and what one does with a headset. Yes there will be trade offs because you get what you pay for, but that doesn't mean by any means these are bad. Think of it like this, if you wanted to get into a great pair of headphones for a young/first time console owner/gamer, I think the price these are at is the right way to go. That way, if something better comes along down the road, then it really didn't hurt you in the wallet. I think for what you get its worth the try. Beware though, someone like me coming off a pair of ancient gaming headphones the audio still takes getting used to for a 7.1 surround with Run Mus because the quality is better.BTW- Invest in Dolby Atmos app to unlock the power in these headphones.",Budget Headset that doesn't break the bank,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

It is definitely made to last. I have dropped it and accidentally yanked on it a few times and it is still working fine.I have one of the newer Xbox controllers that doesn't require the adapter in order for this to work. However, without said adapter, the volume on this headset is very, very low even at the highest volume setting. It's kind of a bummer because the adapter is more expensive than this headset at almost twice the price but I would not use it without one. The difference is night and day.The noise cancelation is fairly poor but that's not really an issue unless you're gaming in a crowded room. I lounge while I play & hold my controller about 6"" from my chin and my friends can hear my controller rumbling through the headset. They also hear my dog whining or making noises. Again, not really an issue since the room is mostly quiet and I only play game audio through the headset, itself. Also, the mute switch on the headset wire makes an audible noise through the headset when flipped. I can't hear it but my friends can.The biggest issue that I have with the headset is that when first plugged in, you are only heard very faintly for several seconds before the volume becomes normal. Anytime I change the batteries on my controller during play, I don't even bother trying to speak to my friends until about 5 seconds pass because they always complain that they can barely hear me until about that time.","Works well, just not on its own.",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

First of all, for the Switch, which is the main reason I bought these for, I have to say that I never thought games could sound so amazing.  True, there's a slight muffling of sounds here and there, but you put those on, and you feel like you are inside your game.  Every sound effect, every song, every clip, clap, boing, or thud, this headset lets you pin point their exact location.  It's great for Animal Crossing, Resident Evil series, Mario series, Touhou series, Senran Kagura series, Dead of Alive Extreme 3, even Pokemon and Bioshock collection, and, heaves, even NES and SNES games feel more immersive.  However, keep in mind that, on Switch, the mic is useless unless you hook up your tablet for chatting while playing.On PS4... it's the first time I felt that I was playing in a room with a surround sound system.  The sound, surprisingly enough, comes clean and crisp, aside form a slight bit of muffling, but other than that, games like Kingdom Hearts 3, Touhou series, Tomb Raider, Child of Light, Project Diva series, Uncharted, Batman series, and Resident Evil series, it's frighteningly immersive too.

The headset is fairly large and feels kinda clunky. The sound quality is still really good and worth the price. The downfall I have noticed the most is the quality of the microphone. My voice sounds slightly muffled and the microphone seems pretty sensitive towards noses that a pop filter would normally help filter out.

Now this isnt too much of a problem but if you are looking for a good quality headset that you will be wearing for streaming or just professional gaming, this might not be the best choice.There have been 2 times where I have plugged it in and it didnt work. All o did was fiddle with the aux cord end and waited for at most 5 min then it would start to work again.Last thing that is more recent is a weird kind of static noise that goes off whenever the cord connected to the controller is shuffled around a bit and also where the cord connects to the headset. This is minor but it still is a little annoying. It has never interrupted my gameplay, but then again, if you are a professional, this may not be the best.Now I love this headset because it was great and I upgraded from earbuds.A few things that some people may run into is that this headset could be too big for small kids because I'm 17 and have it on the lowest setting, again it hurts your ears and sometimes my head after extensive hours of use, and the lighting effect only works really if your xbox/ps4 is right next to your hand because the USB that lights up the headset is right next to the aux cord with little flexibility.

Your voice comes in crisp and clear to others hearing you.The only thing I'm genuinely disappointed on is the light feature. It seems like this is made more for PC Gaming because the USB cable is VERY short. The way the entire cable works is that it is run as a single cable from the headset and then splits into two different cables towards the end. One is the 3.5mm jack to plug into the Xbox controller. The other is the USB drive, which is used to power the lights on the headset. When it is split, the distance is very short, less than 1 foot I'd say. So it makes the USB/light feature utterly useless when using on a console. Very disappointing in that aspect. Now I just have a dead weight hanging off the controller while playing.

I’m impressed with how this headset makes me hear ever sound of the racetrack and tell which side another car is trying to pass me. Plus the passive noise isolation does an excellent job of blocking out external noise. I can never play Forza Motorsport again without “borrowing” one of my kids’ RUNNUS headsets. It really makes me feel like I’m really in the game!Oh, I almost forgot to mention how affordable these were and the quality of build. These headsets feel very sturdy and seem durable enough to survive regular use from my three kids. Although only time will tell how durable they actually are, they sure don’t feel flimsy or cheap like other headsets I’ve tried. It’s surprising how well built they are for the price they are offered. All the positive reviews are accurate. This headset is one of the best electronics values on Amazon.",Must have for Xbox One families!,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

It’s on the cord...not a biggie but a pain to fumble with.The worse thing has nothing to do with the vendor. Whenever I play online with my friends I have to have the volume up load to hear (people running and sneaking up on you.) Unfortunately this causes an echo with all my gaming buddies on the other end like my old corded headset did.I’m going to have to return these and spend the extra money for wireless headphones I guess.

I play mostly using VR but there are two sims that are not VR compatible and I wanted a decent headset with a good microphone for those two games. The RUNMUS Gaming Headset filled the bill for me at a very affordable price. The audio and microphone quality are very good and the headset has a solid, quality feel to it.  Personally I would have liked a lighter weight connection cable and volume/mic control unit but they are workable. The ear cups are larger than I like but are certainly comfortable. My only negative issue was the ""fit"" of the headset itself. I have a smaller, narrower head and the lack of adjustability of the earcups presented a challenge. It was not a problem to get the earcups centered over my ears, what I had difficulty with was ""sealing"" the bottom of the earcups because of the simple design. I worked out a way to get them to fit better using about 1/2"" of cushioned foam to have the headset sit higher on my head and get the angle of the earcups on the side of my head aligned better.  Now that I worked that out I am enjoying using this nice quality headset.

These (my first true gaming headset) do well to sit OVER the ears to relieve pressure. They do trap heat so you need to open them up from time to time and let your ears breath some. The mic seems pretty good as my colleagues had no issue hearing me. They're not true noise-canceling (to me) and it's a bit weird right now hearing my voice inside my head when I talk (it's the effect you get when you have water in your ears) but I think time will make this a moot point.The lighting feature is completely optional (USB), I don't need it so I don't plug that part of the cord in. Cord length is good for a gaming tower sitting on the ground next to the desk. It's also made of the heavy duty braided stuff.I was surprised at the weight of the product as it sits comfortably enough over the head and doesn't feel heavy despite its size. Lots of plastic in the construction helps with this. They are, however, a bit cumbersome because all of the added flair on the sides and top band but overall, not too bad.All in all, a good starter, in-budget gaming headset for me. Quality seems good for now but longevity is to be determined. Right now I use it for No Man's Sky, DCS World (with TrackIR, so I wear the baseball cap with this headset over the cap without issue), American Truck Simulator, and Green Hell and it does the job well - certainly placing you at the center of the action.",Does What it Says.

After a few days, he's expressed excitement over the difference it's had in his performances and immersion.His first experience was playing Red Dead Redemption 2, in which he felt pulled into the atmosphere of the game.  Hoofbeats, rain, thunder, commotion, railroads, and gunfire provided a level of depth that he hadn't experienced before.  The presence of bass is fairly impressive with these ambiences.He then told me that wearing the headphones while playing competitive multiplayer games like Titanfall or Apex have allowed him to better anticipate from where nearby enemies approach thanks to the surround sound.The padding on the ears and band is almost excessive but perhaps that's just an attempt to ensure you feel more comfortable during longer listening sessions.  My brother, having an average sized head, says he doesn't feel any discomfort though.For a pair of $40 headphones which can be used with nearly any electronic device, the audio quality is better than anticipated.  As for the build quality and durability, I can't say much.  The majority of it is plastic and it feels and sounds like it's delicate, but as my family does with all electronics, treat devices with a lot of care.  Many devices are built with plastic after all.*SPECIAL NOTE:  If you're playing on an Xbox One, you'll need a Microsoft headset adapter into which you'll plug the headphones' auxilliary jack ONLY if you don't have newer model Xbox One controllers.  I could be wrong but the controllers included and sold during the circulation of the original Xbox One have a lone headset port that is exclusively designed for the Microsoft Xbox One headsets and this port isn't compatible with most, if not all, aftermarket headsets including the RUNMUS K2.  My brother does play on an Xbox One X though, and the included controllers are updated with a standard AUX port just to the left of the older headset port.  Don't be too trusting but I speculate that more than likely, retailers selling Xbox One controllers nowadays will have an AUX port and you won't need the Microsoft adapter.  Just be sure to check though.  Better to be safe than sorry.  Sadly if your controller is an older model, you'd be better off buying a newer model of Xbox One controller, because the Microsoft headset adapters I've seen average about $80 alone which is insane for an adapter.  Your standard, uncustomized Xbox One controllers are around $60 MSRP.Overall my brother has been very happy with his gift and is using it daily so far.  If you're looking for surprising performance in a practically universal headset and you're on a budget, I'd recommend giving these a go.  For the price, I'm sure you or to whomever you're gifting will enjoy the experience.Edit for those saying it's really quiet:  I encountered this issue when helping my brother with the testing.  Go into your console settings and adjust your device settings.  When he first plugged them in and they were overly quiet, even when increasing the TV's volume or the volume dial on the headset to maximum, I went to the settings and increased the headset volume from 50% to 100% and that made a big difference.",Impressive performance considering the price tag,Color: RedVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I was originally using my webcam as a mic in addition to my headphones which lacked a mic on the audio cord, but that setup was getting real old real fast. I got this one because the reviews looked pretty good, and because I have a bad history with headphones and earbuds breaking and dying pretty fast.I haven't had these for long, but I'm very impressed so far. The mic picks up my voice pretty well, and I really appreciate the fact that the mic piece can be moved and adjusted, not just up and down but closer and away from your mouth. The sound quality in the headset is really good for the price, although I would say maybe the volume needs a little bit of work. Enough background noise still gets through the headset, but I personally don't mind. I really appreciate the fact that the cord has a button you can press to mute or unmute the mic as well as a volume adjustment wheel so you don't have to change your computer's volume.I will add that the headset needs to be at a certain angle on your head in order for your mic to pick up everything you say clearly if you talk quietly. If you're a loud talker like me, you won't have an issue no matter where the mic is, but sometimes when my family is sleeping, I need to speak softly, so sometimes the mic won't pick up my quieter talking.Overall, I would recommend this to someone for their first headset or if they're buying on a budget.",Good budget headset,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

I needed something to get me through the week after my earbuds got eaten by my pets so I searched for something cheap and got better than what I expected. The headset has quality stereo that I would compare to my friend's $70 HyperX. It most certainly is much lighter and that I appreciate because I can wear it all day without discomfort. Likewise it has padding that swallows your face like a La-Z-Boy which has me hardly noticing it.  The controls are simple and I never had an issue with muting myself or adjusting the volume. The material it is made of seems like thick polymer-like plastic that seems durable enough while maintaining a light weight which I'm not aggressive with my gear so I'm sure it will last me a couple years. However; the sizing is a bit ridiculous in my opinion. You can expand the headset if you've got a larger head and as someone that wears 7 1/4 caps I have an average size for a male but I have it shortened all the way and can not imagine how large of a head someone must have to have it all the way expanded. In other words; if you've got a small head then it may be too large and if you have a large head then this certainly fits. Lastly the headset comes with an AUX or USB plugin in addition to a split AUX jack for sharing the sound which is great because I switch between PC and Playstation. For less than 30 dollars I don't think you're going to get a headset much better than this.,The Bang is Worth the Buck,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Good Noise Canceling and large ear muffs CONS: Heavy  Microphone light is immersion breaking if you're not in the zone.  Noise Canceling is not as great on thinner heads.  Surround Sound could be better.  Right of the bat, the first thing you know about the headphone after unboxing is that these are both heavy and quite large.  Whether it's the massive padding or not insignificant size of the earmuffs these headphones are ready to take on even the largest of ears. Putting them on this fact is also reinforced but while hefty they are rather comfortable, something that I suspect will only increase with time as I break them in.  With them being plug in and go on essentially every platform with a fancy splitter for PC and a proper rope cord incasing the wiring, I'm incredibly impressed with the headset right out of the box. The sound is good right out of the box and gives an excellent stereo performance, and while the surround sound is a bit flat in sound depth your never really going to get 100+ surround sound performance out of 30$ headphones. Truthfully I'm rather impressed that the surround sound is a good as it is because while flat it also sounds good and doesn't lose very much tone quality.  On the gamer side, the one true gripe I have on the headphones other than how heavy they are on your head is that the microphone glows. Always. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if the microphone went down more than about 120 degrees but having the microphone always a beacon in your peripheral vision is a bit immersion breaking at times. Otherwise, the mic is a clear passible microphone that gives a solid performance for its price class.  Overall at 30$ with tax right now this headset is a steal for how durable it seems, paired with how clear the sound is, this headset is worth the buy.",A Review of the Red RUNMUS Gaming headset Model: K2,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

This isn't a big bummer for me, but just a good thing to know for others before purchasing. Another great feature is that in the box, along with the headphones and a small instruction manual, there is also an adapter that allows for you to use these headphones on planes (where they require a double audio jack plug). Finally, it also includes a little booklet explaining that if you write a review for these headphones, you get a free item from a small list of items, one of which is another pair of the same headphones.

This is not a big issue, I can still use my glasses tilted slightly down.Second, the noise cancellation is good, but not great. I can still here everything around me clearly.

The main reason for the 3-stars is the durability factor. It feels like one good drop or wandering pets getting caught in the cord would break it in half.2. Due to the durability, the force required to move the mic could also be a problem. Mine was very tight so I have to hold the mic near the bottom and get a good grip on the earpiece it attached to before moving it.Pros:1. Earpiece is very soft and comfortable for people with sensitive ears.2. Sound quality is very good.3. Gaming sounds were picked up very clearly and I could even hear the game's background noises.4. Noise Cancellation was also very good, even with a nearby room fan running.5. Mic was sensitive enough to pick up my chatting even when I was speaking softly. However, the initial volume level it transmitted at was a little low. I had to go into my sound settings and turn it up a little.6. The cord is cloth covered and very flexible. It will not stay coiled up like those cheaper plastic coated ones can. I have also noticed this tends to help reduce tangling as well.7.

I use this for pc.Bottom line... If you want a good gaming headset, buy this. I am picky, cynical and am not impressed easily.PROS:I don't know how they can sell such a great product for as cheap as they do and still turn a profit. I was immediately taken back by how Big these are. Wow. They completely cover my ears easily. The foam makes for a comfy fit. The first night they actually started to give me a slight headache feeling because they were nice and tight which is what I wanted.. My last set would slip if I looked down. I have purposefully over extended them to ""stretch"" them out and these still stay right in place even if I shake my head. The sound quality is really good, definitely exceeded my expectations. They don't have noise canceling properties, but the fit of the thick foam pads around the ears do muffle a lot of any background noise. I have to remove them to hear my girlfriend talk to me, even if I'm not listening to anything, other headsets I've been able to leave on no problem.They are super comfortable and extremely well built. They are big as I said, but it's not all cheap light weight plastic. They are high quality and feel solid, but not too heavy. The fact they light up is irrelevant to me but still cool I guess..People say they hear me perfectly, rarely do they hear background noise like they did before. If they do, it has to be pretty loud and pretty close.. For example, people might hear my girlfriend standing a foot away from my computer desk and purposefully raising her voice. If she talks in normal inside voice the mic doesn't pick it up. Nobody has complained about breathing noises, they can't hear me when I adjust my mic, if my cat bumps my headset, if I take a drink or bite of something....CONS:I guess I'd consider this more of a neutral list instead of cons... But anyway... The headset plugs in the back of the pc with USB and two audio plugs, a green and red/pink. My last two headsets with mics only ever used a USB. Not a real issue though I guess. It would take up your speaker plug in if you had speakers you'd have to unplug them for this headset in order to use it. The volume/mute control box hangs a bit low and has no clip like my last headsets, the clip was nice to clip it on your shirt so it's easier and closer to grab. This box hangs level to the bottom of my chair when wearing the headphones. It can be annoying to keep moving that little box or having to reach for it because it keeps slipping off of my lap. I am 5' 8"" in a office style chair.The chord is short relative to other headsets I've had. It's long enough to reach to the back of my pc and leave some slack, but not much slack. I can't lean over to throw something away in a trash can a few ft away. Luckily my pc sits on my desk, if it was on the floor ( I know a lot of people who do this) it definitely would not reach because it requires you to plug in audio plugs which are generally in the back of the pc.",Amazing deal.

I recently finished building a gaming PC, and as such, decided I needed a microphone and a way to hear others! I looked through the typical big names (Razer, Logitech, etc). I decided I'd try a well received but cheaper product. This is how I found the Runmus that I purchased.Overall, it works great. Are there better headsets out there? Probably. I haven't used any of the more expensive ones, so it is very difficult for me to answer that.However, what this headset accomplishes is being a huge value for the money. I've worn it for hours and it is extremely comfortable. Let me repeat that: It is extremely comfortable even after many hours of wearing. I have another pair of bluetooth (speaker only, no microphone) headphones and they are nowhere near as comfortable. I'm actually amazed at how luxurious this thing feels on my head.Sound. I have mainly been playing Apex Legends with an occasional mix of Skyrim Special Edition. For both of these games, the sound is adequate. I can hear the in game sounds and teammates well enough.

This is where the good part of the review ends, though.I have two major issues that severely impact my opinion of this headset. First of all it's the way it hooks up. It's not a simple USB input; it requires being hooked directly into your computer's audio jack. So in order to use the headphones, I have to unhook my very nice BOSE speakers, which are SIGNIFICANTLY better sound quality. In theory, if the cord were separated about 1 foot further up than it is I could have both plugged in, but that's not really an option with the way the cord is laid out and my desk setup.The second, and larger, issues with it I have is the microphone quality. I had to turn up three separate input settings to maximum to get it to register my voice at an audible level, and having it up that high causes background static and feedback when I talk into it sometimes. Sadly, the microphone is mostly why I bought this given the need to speak to play Pathfinder/D&D on a weekly basis, and to chat in calls for whatever other reason. So to say I'm disappointed in the absolute garbage quality of the microphone is an understatement.Find another alternative if you're looking at this for gaming or even general use.

Would buy again without hesitation.About the item, Gaming Headset for Xbox One in Red. After using for about a week I can say that overall I am pleased with the purchase considering the price I paid. Some brief Cons and Pros.Cons.1. The headphones seem large but that may just be me. I am used to a set of Bluetooth headphones that do not have a mic and do not completely cover the ears and are about half the size.2.  As other reviews have pointed out, they seem to get a bit warm if worn for hours on end. More so on a warm day. However, maybe that is simply an indication I am playing too long and should take breaks anyway :)3.  The over-the-head section is plastic and has a bit of flex to it. I would prefer to see something more rigid plastic or even a bit of lightweight metal for structural reinforcement.  Not sure about the long-term fit.Pros.1. Starting with the over-the-head section. There is a very thick pad underneath that makes wearing them comfortable. Also, they don't press to firmly on the side of my head which may be the case if the over-the-head part had less flex.2. As I said above, the over-the-ear parts seem a bit warm after hours of use, but they also have thick padding and makes them very comfortable to wear. Additionally they completely cover the ears and so block out room noise so that game play is immersive.3. The mic is a much better quality than expected. I recorded myself a couple of times and was very surprised in the clarity and the lack of background noise produced from the mic. A major plus since I was purchasing these for mic use as I am often told that the mic on my Kinect makes me sound like I am in a tunnel far away.....4. As far as overall sound quality, this is my first experience with a gaming head set. I can say that I am also pleased with the sound quality produced. I have typically played my Xbox with a 7.1 surround stereo system and can say that I am pleased with the sound directional environment produced as well as the lows and highs.In summary I am pleased with my purchase. This is my first gaming head set so should I buy something like this again I might use a little more scrutiny BUT I am willing to bet if I were to go that route I would easily pay 2 or 3 times more than I did. As my first gaming head set I am pleased and can say that if you are on a budget and want to try something with confidence that has a great mic, sounds good, and sells for a great price I would certainly give them a try!",Good quality for the price and pleased with purchase.,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

I tried playing games with it for a while and my takeaway is pretty bad:Sound Quality (1/5): I know its cheap but the sound was way worse than my $40 old headset. The treble was pretty bad and clarity was poor. I tried listening to some pop music and it was okay but the sound quality actually kinda bothered me when gaming I switched back to my old headset that's kinda broken...Material (2/5): It's cheaply made and but not too bad. For the price, I could understand but the entire thing seems to be plastic-y if you get what I mean. The earmuffs were not bad, but the cloth felt like it almost comes off once in a while. Not the best for long hours since the headset itself was quite bulky and heavy too.Mic (4/5): This is probably where it shines the most. The mic was definitely good and clear, way beyond my expectation but then, I wish it could go down further since it sort of hang in between my nose and mouse so it was kinda annoying.Overall, I think it would be better to spend a little bit more on a better headset than this one. I get why it has so many reviews now; the company rewards those who submits a review a chance to win some free stuff and gift card so no wonder so many people reviewed it...just like me but well, I don't get why it was all good reviews when the headset is literally clunky.","Great mic, very bad build and sound.",Color: RedVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

He said the pads around the ears and the head are really soft.3. The cups of the headset hold his ears so nicely and make him feel comfortable.4. The audio is really nice.  And the mic is clear.5. The cable is rather long and flexible.6. The controls of the audio and mic is right within reach to adjust the audio volume or to turn on/off the microphone.7. The USB plug is for light.  Hence, it is independent from speaker and microphone.8. The mini plug to gain access to audio and voice works for virtually all modern electronic devices.9. Please note that on some of the old Mac Pro laptop models, there is not microphone input support.  This is an issue of your Mac Pro laptop, ""not with mic on the headset"".  You will probably need the following USB sound adapter to get both speakers and microphone work on your old Mac Pro laptops.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IRVQ0F8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=110.

I am an avid gamer. I have been through every headset imaginable. About a month before Christmas, my old Astro HS stopped working so I bought these as a temporary replacement until Santa Claus could stop by with the HS I wanted for Christmas. Honestly, for $30 I did not expect this headset to be anything but mediocre. I was SO very wrong. Hands down, this is the BEST headset I have ever used. And I have used ALOT of headsets. Noise cancellation is incredible! Durable& bulky but still great to fit dainty female ears like mine. You can also adjust these to fit smaller heads with no problem!The ear cuffs are super soft and comfortable. I am able to wear them for a long period of time without any discomfort. Very breathable material so no sweaty ears! Comfort is at 100%. Sound quality is perfect. You can’t get any better with the sound. You can hear EVERYTHING around you, which direction it’s coming from etc. You feel like you are actually in the game. The mic is perfect. No irritating feedback or echo. Needless to say, after buying this HS, I decided to tell Santa that I did not want the $300 headset that I had asked for previously. This one was WAYYY better and WAYYY more affordable.I commend this company for making an effort to produce a high quality product that everyone can afford!If you are looking for a headset, stop here.

As you can see in the photo, I have a newer generation controller that has a built-in audio port. Older versions of this controller will need an adapter to use this headset. Overall, I am pleased with this product. I don't write many reviews on Amazon, but felt I needed to give an honest review so others can make informed purchases. I always like the straight forward pros vs cons reviews so I will be using that method.PROS:• SOUND: The sound quality is very good. They sound just as good as my previous headset that cost $100• NOISE CANCELLATION: I was impressed with the over-the-ear hug that greatly reduced outside sounds.• COMFORT: I have not experienced any head or ear ""aches"" from wearing them for more than 1 hour.• EASE OF USE: No charging. No firmware updates. Plug and play. Simple.CONS:• WEIGHT: This headset is heavy and very bulky. It may not be the best option for youth.• CORD: The cord is long. Very long. It is also very thick, which may be durable, but is hard to deal with at times.• USB: The LED lights ONLY work if the USB is plugged in. For me the extra dongle just gets in the way.• MIC: The mic arm is semi-rigid. Very limited on shaping it.Overall, this headset works well and does what I need it to do. For the price, I couldn't ask for much more. It would be nice if they made a version specifically for connecting to controllers without the extra long cord and without the USB dongle.",Almost Perfect Budget Gaming Headset,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

I accidently broke my Astros so I needed a new headset in a pinch. These had high reviews,surprisingly, and I never heard of the brand. I just assumed it was a cheap chinese headset that lit up and would die after a couple months of using it. Which was fine I didn't plan on using these long term, and figured these would be good backups just incase I run into this issue again. Well they didn't which was great. I was overall pretty happy with these, but as I expected there were things that did come up that are typical of these kinds of headsets. Ill explain.ProsFits nicelyComfortableI personally am a fan of bass so these actually provide a good amount of itCool designCan game for a decent amount of time with these before you start getting hot and have to take them off.Headphones block out excess noise pretty well while youre gamingCons- Price...even though 30-40 bucks generally isn't really expensive for a headset...the overall quality of these really feels like a under 30 dollar headset. Im not really quite sure what you're paying for. Yes they claim it has noise cancelling, 7.1 surround, lights up, etc etc. However the build and performance of these in my opinion doesn't justify the price tag. I feel like theres better headsets out there in this price range that give you better quality overall.-Cheap plastic feel-My ears get hot during long gaming sessions wished they would have allowed more airflow to keep your ears cooler-Music is not as crisp as it could be even though it has a nice amount of bass its a budget headset so I don't expect quality but still something to note.-The wiring is very dodgy it has a braided cable which is nice but for whatever reason when I plug these into my PC no matter which connection I plug it into if its not a certain way you get buzzing and awkward feedback-The mic sucks, when im playing FPS games I leave my Mic open and not push to talk. It picks up outside noise but it doesnt....and what I mean by that is other people im playing with will see my name pop up and tell me they cant hear me but im not saying anything its very strange. You have to have the mic pretty close to your mouth in order for it to pick up your voice properly ive been told at times I sound very low and my volume is fairly high. I tried recording audio with it for a review i was doing and it came out with a faint buzzing sound with a little bit of low volume even through I adjusted it, it didnt help.Final thoughtsOverall its a good budget headset It gets the job done. Does it deserve its 5 start rating? No. I wasn't surprised with some of the things I expected to happen. You're not gonna get great quality with headsets like these. Theres gonna be pros and cons like I stated above. Again I was surprised at the quality of music when played through them love the bass, had... not great sound quality, but decent. I was expecting terrible base and sound.  Like the design its pretty cool and different from your typical Turtle Beach or whatever brand you find at a best buy or electronic store. Even though I said the Mic was kinda meh it still didnt sound awful and I still could get the Mic to work properly with some adjustments. So if you need something cheap that looks cool and works ok... look no more! If you think this is gonna be equivalent to a Logitech, Kingston, Steele Series etc...don't be fooled.  You get what you pay for GENERALLY with gaming gear.  Just save your money if you want a quality headset.",Not bad for a budget headset,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

You can't move it with one hand as it will take the whole headphone with you.

I don't see anyway to adjust it.I'm also not a huge fan of the design. It seems overly ""robotic"" with lots of extra plastic pieces making the headset appear to be very large.

It picked up my air conditioner running in the background (25 feet away).- The microphone jack sometimes produces a little static if moved around in the controller.- The microphone angle needs to be able to go down further because it stays in my eyesight and is slightly distracting.- The cable is nice, but it's a little long for consoles.- The microphone adjustment controls can be a little awkward to find while you're watching the screen. I'm used to them being right on my controller for Xbox. I wish the controls were on the headset itself.- The lights work when plugged in via the USB port, and they're very dim.

The sound was very muffled and everything was drowed out by the bass.  It was almost as if someone turned the treble to zero and the bass to 100%.  I swapped the headset back to my old ones and confirmed that it wasn't my computer that was having issues.  Same ports plugged in gave completely different sound qualities between the two headsets.

I thought it would not be possible that my drivers were not properly installed if my old headset was working great, but I went ahead and checked anyways.  Lo and Behold, it turned out my audio drivers were actually not installed properly and windows was just using the generic windows audio drivers.  I searched for my motherboard's audio drivers, installed them, and afterwards I was able to play with the 3D equalizer.  After playing around with the equalizer, I was able to make the headphones sound MUCH MUCH better.  I am now puzzled why the Turtle Beach headset never needed a proper audio driver... maybe because it was stereo and not 7.1 surround?So far, I haven't noticed the advantage of having a 7.1.

It came the day after I ordered them and as I took them out of the box, all I could think of was how these were defiantly not my style. They are large and come with a thousand different types of cables that I can’t identify. I put them on and plugged them into my computer and watched cartoons for a good while, impressed with the sound quality, before remembering that I had to wrap them for my younger goob of a sister. As I was about to take them off, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the TV and by gosh itself did I look like I could be a professional e-sports player!! I marveled at the way the mic curved around to pick up my soon-to-be fire insults. I could see myself expertly using reflexes honed by years of training as I beat the crap out of other players. I could imagine children logging onto their games and freezing in fear as my notorious gamer tag appeared on their screen! If I wanted to pursue this life, I knew what I had to do. That day, I told my parents that I would be moving into the basement and dropping out of my summer English class. They cried. I nailed the windows shut, bought a microwave, and a pallet of pizza rolls. I sat down in my gamer chair and put on the RUNMUS Gaming headset. This is my ninth day of becoming a gamer and I write this while I wait for Call of Duty to download. I know I can’t live like this for much longer. I haven’t had any human contact in so long and I’m starting to forget what other food tastes like. My pale complexion longs for the myth they call sunlight. I’m starting to wonder if there is more to life than gaming. I need to give these to my sister. Yes, I have to go back to the life I once had. Is it even possible? I have to believe it is. I’ll devise a plan, yes! I’ll give this headset to my sister and watch as she takes this spiral into being a video game master. From there, I shall mend ties with my parents and inherit her college money. I’ll get my master’s degree in psychology and help other kids who have taken the path I know I must leave. Buy these at your own risk. I don’t know if it’s magic or just the immaculate sound quality, but there is something about this headset that is dangerous. Farewell gaming community. To those who still choose to play, may your buttons never stick, and may your internet always be fast and know that with these headphones, you will always hear your success and your words will always ring in your enemies’ ears. I must go, do not worry for me any longer for I have found the wrapping paper and know what I must do.",These Are A Game-Changer,Color: RedVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

However, I'm an avid user of both consumer-grade and professional-grade electronics, and as an audio/video professional I work with high-end headphones on a daily basis—including those from Bose and other top name-brands. These far-less-expensive headphones sound excellent when compared to their costly counterparts. The design/build quality is also quite impressive. I was very pleasantly surprised at the size and heft of the product. It is well-made and has ample padding on the upper band as well as around the over-ear cups. The cable and connections are equally well-made, and the removable adapter is a nice touch; since I don't need it, I was glad to get it out of the way. I was also very pleased with the built-in volume control dial and physical microphone mute switch, which are features I was unaware of when I made my purchase. As far as the microphone goes, that is much more difficult to test without being on the ""receiving end"" of the conversation, but when asking others how I sound they've unanimously confirmed the quality is fantastic. That's more than enough evidence for me that these are a keeper and a great value. And that is still true despite the fact that I purchased these at the current high point of the product's CamelCamelCamel price history.","Fantastic value, truly impressed; would recommend and buy again!",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Videos of tropic rainforests felt immersive and full of life. Chirps, rustling leaves, and deep thunder surrounded me, and I felt transported into the environment.While playing Modern Warfare multiplayer, I was able to run-and-gun while hearing enemies from all directions. Small sounds like personal UAV's whirred accurately above the battlefield, and were much easier to shoot down due to this headset's accurate and precise surround sound. If you're looking for a headset to up your game, this definitely could be a good fit for you!The build quality is good on this headset, but the headband doesn't feel incredibly durable. The braided cable is fairly long and feels tough. It has a USB attached for powering the LED lights. There is a 3.5mm audio and mic splitter for PC.The headset is comfortable, and does not squeeze my head. I wear glasses, and while it isn't glasses-friendly per-sé, I did not notice any added discomfort from wearing my glasses with the headset. The band is adjustable enough to fit on myself and my kids - both of which we're thrilled by the surround sound and clarity of the audio.Overall, the Runmus K2 is quite possibly the best value in gaming headsets, and stands tall as one of the best headsets that I have tried under $60.

This is the loudest I’ve found. Friends say in chat I sound good. Cord is a tad long but not a major con just wrap and tie. They are bulky but lightweight. Comfortable but a little warm. They are worth it so far. It’d be cool if they came up with a way to use the led other than the usb plug. I’m playing on a PS4 and it’s across the room plus I can’t plug into controller and usb even if I was sitting close. I count on reviews when I buy so this is keeper so far. That says a lot because I’ve sent several headsets back just wasn’t loud enough. I’m gonna eventually have to do wireless just hate having to charge them because I game for hours at a time. Sometimes all day. Also it doesn’t cancel out all outside noise. That could be a con even though they are louder than most. Hopefully I helped someone.

Very high quality microphone, really good audio in the ears (almost better than my 5.1 surround setup.... scary).  Only hickup was the setup process.  I was anticipating a USB or alternatively 3.5mm jack, either or option.  Instead, the USB only powers the red led lighting, the 3.5mm jack is required for audio.  The second part of this hickup is the rear panel audio is used for my 5.1 surround setup with a spare line-in jack and mic jack.  However this device wants dedicated ports instead of smart splitting the rear panel options to power the headset.  So I'm forced to use front panel, which is fine, but I like hidden wires.

It really only blocks out very low frequency noise.  I have two sets of noise canceling headphones for travel and both are far better in that department.

In the last couple of years some of the lighter built headsets have not been able to hang with him. This set is thicker and feels sturdier. Sound quality is on par with a 40 to 60 dollar Turtle Beach headset, but with a thicker insulated wire. The mic is non-detachable. He has had other headsets where the mic could be removed, but that generally led to lost or broken mics. So far for the cost this headset looks like it will hold up and provide the same for less. I will give further feedback after he has had more play time with it.Edited:I am back with a 4 month update on this headset. They were a Christmas gift to my son. I left my original review on Dec. 26, 2019. I have updated the title and to reflect a more appreciative tone that the previous review.The headset has so far paid itself off. My son has spent much of his free time playing games. He plays Xbox and has friends he chats with from the moment he turns it on to the moment he turns it off.He gets lost in the sound of his headset and uses them as a tool in games that have high quality sound audio that can affect gameplay. He has never complained of headaches or ear pain while wearing them.He plays games with his uncles and myself often. He is clear on the microphone and no one has issues with his sound coming through. He does sit under a fan and that can, depending on the speed setting of the fan, override the noise cancellation in the mic. Setting adjustments for mic sensitivity can accommodate for this issue on most games.Four months later and his headset is still in great condition. He has dropped it on two occasions that I know of and the headset is functioning well and I can't tell what is normal surface scratching compared to a mark possibly left from the drops.To date these are his favorite headset (he has owned 3 turtle beach headsets that ranged from 40 to 60 dollars a piece.). He likes the feel, doesn't feel like if he jumps up excited they will fly off. He has no complaints about sound quality and on the occasions I have put them on they sounded perfectly acceptable. Nothing I wasn't used to, but not quite the highest surround sound quality that I get from my own high end headset.I do have a big gripe with the light up LED option. It is an USB cable that plugs in near the 3.5 mm plug off the same primary line. What this means if you are buying for the light up feature for someone who plays on a console and not a PC then you will be disappointed. Using the PC adapter from 3.5mm to mic and audio splitter 3.5mm plugs you can light this headset up using the USB plugin. This is not an option when plugging into a controller without making something make shift to supply voltage over USB. Consider the LED more of a bonus feature than a buying point.TL:DR - This headset hits all the marks necessary to make this a worth while investment with low buy in and a surprising quality that was not expected. Physically feels solid, maybe a little too heavy. Has held up to the terrors of a teenage boy without missing a beat for 4 months. Features like noise cancellation and surround sound work as advertised. LED light up feature should be considered novelty and a bonus if you happen to plug into a PC where there is a USB plug available.",A surprising and unexpected quality for the cost,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

These are very sturdy. In the past some headsets I have had just felt cheap. Not these. They are extremely well built. I don't worry about breaking them at all. Next is sound quality which is incredible. The ear pads are soft and wont hurt your ear. I have pretty big ears and they just barely cover them but I don't get part of my ears pinched like some other headsets do. They are slightly heavier than some other ones I have used but not so much as it is an issue. The only minor drawback I have is they do grasp pretty tightly to the sides of your head even when adjusting them, so after really long periods of use may you may need to take them off for a minute to relieve the pressure. This is not a major issue though as I would rather have them tight as opposed to slipping or falling off as I move around. Definitely recommend these 5/5 stars especially when comparing the price to other headsets of equal quality.",Extremely high quality for the price,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Although I couldn't see the noise cancelling being put in place, still a pretty good microphone and competes with other headsets in the 20$-50$ price range. You'll be able to talk to friends on discord or teammates in competitive-type games. The mic is also adjustable which is a plus.The fit is amazing, tons of padding on the ears which make it suitable for wearing glasses or for general use. The headset is very bulky, and is made mostly out of plastic. It's looks very big on your ears and suitable for gaming or office use.The headset has two connections attached to it, one is a 3.5 audio jack, and a USB port. The audio cable is for the audio and microphone, the USB is for the lights (no audio) for a console just plug in the audio jack into a console controller, however since there isn't a USB connection on most console controllers, the USB just dangles, which can be a bit annoying.The seller also honored their one-year warranty, when the headset audio suddenly wasn't working, the seller contacted me less than 24 hours and gave me a free replacement which has been working perfectly since then.In conclusion, I'd say go for it, they are honestly better than the BENGOO G9000's or any other headset in this price range, you can find this headset for the same price yet they are far more superior and futureproof.NOTE: YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG THE SPLUTTER ATTACHED TO THE HEADSET IF YOU ARE USING A CONSOLE OR PC with a 7.1 audio jack, this is mainly for PC's with separate microphone and headphone jacks.",Runmus K2 Pro Gaming Headset - Decent Headset at a Great Price,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

There is one ""power cord' which seems to be a standard 3.5mm plug in. Split off a few inches from the end is another cord (USB) for the lights. I plugged them in, and they do look cool. However, I don't have them on most of the time.Now for the Pros: they are glasses friendly, able to flex a great deal, and have great noise quality. I wear glasses. On-the-ear headphones are very uncomfortable for me. These are over-the-ear and are VERY comfortable, even with the weight. The padding on the top and around the ears is very nice as well. This headset will not break from slightly twisting it; there is a ton of built-in give and take when it comes to these! Plus, the design looks cool. Finally, these are not noise cancelling headphones, but they do have great sound quality. I can hear things around me while I wear them, but I would say these are noise isolating.

It seemed to have a bit more leveled out sound. I don’t play online so I’m not sure about microphone quality. The headset is a little on the heavy side, but very comfortable. The pressure on the head is very light. The major con was just how hard it drained my controller battery. It’s like night and day compared to my HyperX. I had a fully charged battery pack that would normally last 20 gaming hours without a headset. My HyperX reduces the battery life to 10 hours. This headset took a half charged battery to zero in around 60 minutes. The other bummer is that this headset’s cable is very long.

Amazon pointed me toward Run Mus, who has much higher reviews and thousands more accounts of happy customers.

He plugged them in to our PS4 controller, figured out the mic and volume control with ease, and launched Rise of the Tomb Raider. Big smile!I tried them out myself playing Death Stranding, and was pretty wowed by the quality. The headset sits comfortably for both of us (and my husband's head is kind of big, haha.) The cushion against your ear is great and definitely benefits the noise cancellation. I will say this isn't 100% noise-canceling, but it does the job as well as a pair of Bose noise-canceling headphones I use for work, and those cost $400. So, you're getting fantastic quality at a fantastic price.The material is sturdy without compromising flexibility. I feel as though you'd have to put good effort into it for it to break or snap anywhere. The cord for the jack and USB plug is covered sort of like a shoelace, and it's got a good amount of length (which I imagine is geared more toward PC gaming.) Because it is so long, it also comes with a velcro wrap to keep it tidy for when it is plugged into the controller.This is our first time buying anything from Run Mus, and needless to say we are looking into what else the brand has to offer.

I’ll start with the negatives. First of all, they are enormous. I’ve never seen such a giant headset in my life! Not sleek at all. Secondly, the don’t fit very well on my head. They are adjustable in length so that’s fine, but the bottoms of the actual ear covers come out slightly near the bottom of my ear which causes it to not fully cover my ear. It puts a little pressure above my ear due to this and I cannot get the full audio experience unless I hold them down to my ears which obviously isn’t possible while gaming. Thirdly, they are made out of some cheap plastic and do not feel high quality at all. For these reasons, I almost returned them.That’s when I figured I would test them out before I send them back. And here’s where the positives come into play. These headphones sound incredible for the price. They must have just skimped completely on the actual material design of these just so they could put high quality tech inside the set. I immediately went to YouTube and searched for a 100D surround sound song to test and it realy surprised me how great they sounded. The surround sound is absolutely amazing and very clear. Sounds like you’re actually in the room with the artist. I recommend listening to Bohemian Rhapsody in 100D on YT. After a few more tests I decided to keep them. Even though they aren’t as comfortable or visually appealing as I had hoped they are worth the price and at the least a great backup set until you can afford to get something a little more high end.On a side note, as a bonus in the box is a free gift voucher in which you can receive another of the same headset for free or you can choose another one of their free items which includes a gaming mouse, headset stand, mini Bluetooth speaker, or a regular degular Bluetooth headset (not for gaming I believe). If you don’t want any of that stuff you can just choose to have them send you a $15 amazon gift card. Pretty cool. All you have to do is write a review and send them screenshots. That is another reason why I am choosing to keep this headset.","Too long, but do read",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

The headphones are easy to plug in, but since it does not have its own driver, you have to use Realtek audio driver. It probably is easy to set up, but since I never  had to use Realtek before, it was a bit of a learning process. At first the headset would occasionally cut out or make static noises when ever I am using discord or starting a game. But I did find out that the old headset was still somewhat interfering and after disabling it, I have not had that problem since.The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that when I am using discord, when ever I put the mic on mute, the speaker audio loops into the mic and what ever I am listening to in the speakers, everyone else can listen too in discord.

For this pricepoint, I genuinely think you won't find better. They do leave just a little bit of room on top, but the ears grip snugly and comfortably so they still won't budge; even after 6 straight hours, I barely notice that I have them on. I have a skinnier head shape, but they still conform to me (plenty of extra bend so I suspect they'll fit most anyone). The padding on top is hugely comfortable, soft to touch but firm enough that you won't feel plastic on your scalp. No bad molding seams to catch your hair on. If I'm running laundry - I can't hear it through these. The audio is impeccable. You shouldn't expect richness in low bass tones, but it handles audio crisply and without any speaker noise, higher quality than my Vizio audio. When nothing is happening, there's no white noise or static. Voice chat comes through with the clarity of VoIP. Voicechat partners have reviewed my sound, and tell me that the mic picks me up perfect - no complaints. Interestingly, they seem to hear less of my background noise than on other headsets, which is a huge plus for this mic setup. The mic itself is rigid once you've bent it into place, so you won't face the issue of mic droop every time you move your head. It's long enough to accommodate wherever you'd like to place it. I have had no issues with the 3.5 mm jack - no twists or pulls causing static or loss of connection (how annoying is that when it happens...). The volume dial is sturdy, and the fob with the volume and mute buttons are placed perfectly on the cable - not high enough to get in the way, nor low enough to be annoying. The mute button also has a nice, soft click into place, so you'll always know you've gotten it switched even in the dark. I've used this primarily through an Xbox controller, though I have loaned it to my wife for PC games. Connections work well for both. The cables are nicely wrapped, and I've noticed no indication of fray yet. They feel extremely sturdy. I've had other budget headsets from brands like Kotion Each (long-lasting choice, btw), and these are definitely made with a higher quality plastic. It feels thick in the hand, rather than flimsy. Absolutely no warping or bending yet. Lightweight as well, so you'll feel plenty free. They look exactly like the photos in person, so what you see will be exactly what you get, and they are handsome. So to sum up, if you're on a budget and trying to figure out if these are for you, they are. I expect them to last me a long time. Big ups.",More than you expect!

Overall, I can recommend this headset to many people who are on a budget. But with some more design/engineering improvement, this headset could be even much better.Fit/comfortThis headset feels comfortable with decent materials. It doesn't hurt to put on for a couple of hours. Note that this headset is pretty big though. It could feel pretty bulky for some people with a smaller head. The weight of the headset is fairly light, so the weight isn't heavy. It's just somewhat bigger than expected. Because it's kind of bulky, I do have a bit of room left right below my ears. So, depending on your head shape/size, it may not provide the perfect noise cancellation you are looking for.Material:Overall, it's made of light plastic with leather around the area where you skin contacts. These are decent material for a budget, but I think the manufacturer can use some improvement to use a better type of plastic or more wiremesh to give a bit more expensive feel. The leather cushion feels nice and comfortable, but the headset pieces may feel too light for some people.Sound/mic quality:I'm an audiophile with a lot more expensive headphones. Based on my personal experience, this sounds better than the $26 headset, but also do not expect the headset to have a $100+ headset. If you were to put a price tag on it, I can say it sounds like a $50 + headset. I personally will adjust eq on my headset so that I can adjust the sound quality\. On the other hand, the mic quality is clear and crisp.I would recommend this headset for people who are low on budget.**Suggestions to the manufacturer:1. Consider adding a 180-degree rotation axle so that the earpieces can rotate. This rotation in the phones will allow a perfect fit around the ears and the head, which will then allow every kind of head shape/size will enjoy the perfect noise cancellation.  This should help address the gap that I have underneath my ears.2. Consider using different types of material to provide a different feel to the material. Leather/cushion is fine, but the actual plastic pieces can be improved.3. Sound Quality: not bad for the $26 headset, but some more engineering could make it even better.",Good Gaming Headphones for the price,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

The headset was neatly wrapped in bubble wrap inside the box, cords neatly wrapped and assembled, easy to remove for use, and with instruction manual.Verified works for Xbox One (newer controller that doesn’t need adapter) and PC.I have used them during gaming, while watching videos and listening to music.  The sound quality is excellent and I'm very happy with not only the great sound but also the surround sound and gaming experience!Very comfortable to wear and fits well on my head and they seem very durable!The actual wire/cables are super solid and protected by an outer sleeve layer of “threaded” type cord. Not the plastic stuff. They have a great length to them and seem durable. Super extra bonus...you not only get the headset jack that goes into any headphone jack or newer Xbox controller, but it also has the mic/headphone splitter for your pc. I had to purchase a separate splitter cord for my previous headset. It all has a usb plug to illuminate the mic and headset with the color I purchased, which is red.There are a couple of downsides.  One, the mic out of the box is very low when connecting to pc but with some settings adjustments it worked out fine. The other downside is there is a slight crackle/static sound when plugged into the Xbox One controller if you move the plug at all.  Doesn't make the sound unless you bump the jack near the controller itself.Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this for average gamers for the super great price!",I can’t hear you for the great sound in my headset!,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Only thing that might have edged it to 5 stars for me was that I'm in an area with a lot of ambient noise and the microphone arm had just a single pivot point (at the ear), and I would have liked the boom microphone piece to be able to be closer to my mouth to reduce that.","Great Headset, great value",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Not a problem though.Easy controls and I enjoy the mute mic slide on the adjust volume port.Cons:Immediately out of the box it has connection port issues into the xbox controller by the 3.5mm Jack. If I even slightly move my controller in any direction other than forward it has some of the worst connection static that can completely cut my voice out when talking.The cable may be a little too long for some who don't directly connect it to a computer for gaming.

(I'm very very careful of how I treat my microphones) they have never even seen a 1 inch drop onto the couch.So to chalk it up, the headset is good for a beginner headset just getting into gaming. For professional players it does not have the sound you need for real dedicated directional information relay. Also it is slightly muffled? Could just be my headset and not everyone else's?

I have a surround sound and I love playing on that but when I want to play with my friends I have to have the audio turned down so low to be able to hear them with my one ear headset. This puts me at a disadvantage when I can't hear or tell where footsteps are coming from on games like call of duty. The sound quality is better then I anticipated for an inexpensive pair of headphones, I can generally tell which direction someone's coming from and the audio is clear and mostly crisp. A couple reasons why they didn't get a 5 star: The 3.5mm jack that plugs into the controller is some what finicky, if I bump it at all when I'm playing it will make a scratchy sound and occasionally I have to spin the cord as one ear will cut in and out. I usually don't bump it so it's not something that happens often. The other issue is that some of my friends headsets have two separate volume controls for voices and game audio which would be really convenient. Sometimes on games like call of duty when someone calls in a helicopter or an air strike, the audio is so loud that it drowns out my friends voices. When someone has a helicopter in the sky for 30 seconds it makes it extremely hard to communicate with them during this time",Solid overall headset with a few minor flaws,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Suffice to say, it sometimes feels like certain frequencies are getting a bit squashed (perhaps in the mid range?). This can make music sound a little peculiar at times. As if you're not getting not as full a sound as you might get from fancier headphones. But to be clear, I'm used to playing music through my beloved Bose Quietcomforts, which are expensive and awesome. In addition, I don't care about this. All it means is you shouldn't buy these if you wanted them primarily to listen to music, which I doubt anyone does.

When you open the box, it feels like you're lifting tech from the gods (or it did for me since I was using pretty basic stuff until now. I plugged it in and put it on and haven't stopped smiling. The sound quality is great, the noise cancelling is fantastic and the cable connecting the headset to the controller is beyond strong, so I have high hopes this headset will last a fairly long time.One other feature I really love is the sound control that's on the cable. I like to be able to hear what's going on in my house in case someone needs me or if I'm home alone. The sound control is a simple, but sturdy feeling rotating know that lets me turn down the volume to hear the outside world while still being able to focus on the gaming world. And if I need to listen for footsteps or something in the game, it's easy to grab it and turn up without sacrificing a lot of time. Really great feature.For those looking to buy, you need to make sure you know what connection you controller needs. If you're using original Xbox one controllers, you will need to buy an adapter. However, if you are using new Xbox One, PS4, computer, etc. the cable comes with a USB and audio jack already integrated, with an audio jack splitter that allows for two connections.Last thing: The headset is slightly bulky so you may want to invest in a headset stand if you can afford the space it takes up.

This is probably only a problem for someone using a desktop, though. Otherwise, the shorter length is probably a benefit. Second, the earmuffs don't articulate.

My initial impressions are that they are pretty decent gaming headset for the money.  The red USB powered lighting is nice, but I haven't found a way to turn if off without having to unplug the USB.  The ear cuffs are pretty huge and will definitely cover your ears fully.  I haven't noticed any issues with the wait or feel while using, but the longest I have worn them for is only for 1 hour straight, so can't comment on how they will feel wearing them continuously for several hours.  I can pick up the surround sounds with these and they are much better that the 2 computer speakers I was using before.  I had to turn the gain way up on the mic with the recording software I use, so I am not sure if that is due to the mic or the software.PROs:- Good gaming sound- Braided cord- USB powered LED lighting- Price- Comfort (so far)- easy connect for PCCONs:- no way to turn off LED without unplugging USB cable- terrible for music listening- a bit bulky- ear cushions aren't very softIn conclusion for the money these are what I expected them to be.  They are a good starter gaming set or would be a good set for kids since they are inexpensive and you would worry less about them breaking them.  I would most likely buy these again as my first streaming headset and upgrade down the line.",Quality inexpensive beginner PC gaming headset.,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

When in use they fit rather well and don’t feel as if they will fall off when in a ‘jam session’. Ear foam is thick enough to encompass the entire ear without discomfort. When wearing the headset there’s a small pinky gap around neck line that tends to let in outside ambient noise. Enough that I can hear outside conversations if my volume is turned down low enough. However the compression doesn’t give me a headache as others with better formfitting headphones give. After a few hours of wear, they breathe well that I don’t feel myself sweating underneath them. Adjusting the sides seem on the stiff side yet stay when final height is reached. Rotating the mic up and down also feels a bit tough to adjust as if I might break it during adjustments.

Another major problem is you can't use the LED lights at all because the LED plug & the plug that goes in to the ps4 controller are connected to each other & the cord length is shorter than my hand so once you plug in the LED light in to the ps4 you won't be able to plug it in to the controller unless your gonna play with your controller right on the ps4. To improve this headset the seller needs to remove the LED lights & put that cost in to improving the sound or make the LED cord a lot longer & out more resources in to improving the sound.

It looks cheap and I wasn’t even sure the thing was going to work. Secondly, the cord that connects to the controller is, and I’m not joking, the length of my queen size bed. The noise cancellation aspect of it is nonexistent. When I played all I could hear were my thumbsticks moving around. The volume and mic controls are on a big bulky thing that weighs 5 pounds and makes your head tilt to one side. Finally, if you’re not using a computer it has a usb cord that is just there.

One of them for some reason just doesn't fit.  It's too big and loose, even though it's at the smallest setting.  The ear portion goes too low past the ear, so it doesn't cover the whole ear.  There is too much space between the head and headband.  I am not sure why this 3rd one has issues.  I noticed that the mic button also didn't work.  There is a button that you can turn our mic on and off, but it seemed to be always on even when I switch it off.  Another one seems to have the mic cut in and out so that you don't really hear what the person is saying.  The 3rd one is mostly ok.  I find they are all kind of heavy and they have a tendency to loosen the headband a bit as you wear it, maybe from its own weight.  The sound is good and you can hear more different sound with it than from just the laptop.  The mic picks up the tiniest sound, so you can hear people clicking their keyboards or whispering in the background.  You need to plug in two different ports on your computer if you want to have it glow.  I wish it used just 1 port because depending on where the ports are on your laptop, it may not reach both ports, or it could end up making you have to plug something in on the right side of your laptop, which may get in the way of your mouse when you're gaming.",Good,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Note that some of these will be a little in between.Positives:These headphones are decently functional. The sound quality isn't exactly the best, but it's not the worst.The microphone works well enough, no complaints from the other side but when asked it sounded ""a little metallic"" though that could have been the platform I was using (discord on a windows 10 computer, probably not the mic's fault but I can't be sure).If you buy these on sale, they are of good price. However, 42 dollars is way too much for these given the quality they are.They are sturdy, big, and admittedly comfortable if worn for a short time.Negatives:They are heavy. You will not want to be wearing these for more than an hour at a time. Your neck will be sore if you go longer than that.They are bulky. You will look a little silly wearing these if your head is on the smaller side.The sound quality isn't the best. It's good enough for what it is, but there are better options.If your ears stick out a little or a lot, they will rub against the inside of the earphone. It's not comfortable, and can leave the ear red and sore if worn long enough.The mic sticks out when not in use (even when placed in the upward position), it cannot be detached but it can be bent to how you prefer.They are not good for public use unless you have a large head. The ears will not be properly covered and noise will be heard by those around you, even at a reduced volume.In short: If you plan on wearing them for a short time (less than an hour at a time, your times may vary) they are a good buy on sale. If you are looking for headphones to jam out to music with, look elsewhere as the sound quality isn't high enough for that. It is decent enough to hear what you need to hear in a video game, but there'd still be better headphones for that as well.EDIT: Mentioned the platform I was experiencing mic issues with to give a more fair review on the product.To follow up on some previous things:The company followed up on the review making sure to touch up on the issues I mentioned here, seeing if they could fix anything. The review will stand at 3 stars as it's a review of the product itself, however I would highly recommend the company themselves after the feedback I got.The product I purchased is now collecting dust and will probably only be used as a backup, but I am still happy with my purchase due to the follow up from the company themselves.",Okay if you're on a budget.,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Your ears won’t be crying in pain! And as for a bonus it makes the headphones feel much more lighter than they appear to be.-Noise cancellingGoing along with the price the noise canceling of this headphones is great, too great in reality. For the price of the headphones you can’t ask for more. I chose this brand mostly for the mic quality (it has a great one) and bonus the sound quality while gaming.Cons:- PaddingThe padding does carry its benefits but it does carry its disadvantages too. One that I noticed is that with prolonged used and competitive gaming the heat side will be left with seat. If you are a competitive gamer or do things that make you sweat while using them I would recommend just for that. However if all you do is be in zoom meetings or online conferences then you have nothing to worry about.First Look:Out of the box it’s simple you have your headphones with the adapter included and a manual. The adapter came in handy when I needed to use it with my gaming laptop. One thing that you might notice is that there is static noise whenever you are not using the mic, noticing this is not hard but when you talk it goes away.

Overall, the sound quality is superb compared to others like MPOW and Sennheiser. There is little to no sound dampening, but because it is over the ear, it does muffle some outside sound, if you have the volume up. PC Games like Assassin's Creed, Motogp, Tera Online, Destiny1/2, Battlefield, and COD sound great. Listening to spotify or just general music on the PC is great as well.The biggest gripe i have is the overall quality of its structure and wires. The wires have never really straightened out after all this time, to a point where it auto tangles due to its own tension. This is a problem because it causes internal wear and tear on the wire and where it connects to at the base of the headset and its volume control. So much so, that after a year, it is having issues with sending and receiving sound. I have to jiggle the wires for both headphone to work. Lighting has never faded, so that is a positive. However, the internal headband is now coming loose and is rickety, but also draws out too easily causing readjustment here and there.Overall, for the $40 price tag, this is a great intro set to gaming headsets if you are strapped for cash, or getting for your kids, and will last for about a year before you have any real issues.  Also, be mindful, this is a generic headset that has many clones that look just like it. I am assuming it is an industry base model that is shared to many companies, so there are others out there that look exactly like this, but a different brand, and cost a butt load more. So, for price, this is the best base/standard headset you can find.","Good sounding headset, Other things are a slight quality issue.",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Crisp sound - I could hear the game AND party chat clearly. Previous gaming headsets made it hard to hear the party/game chat over the game sound. These clearly differentiate the two audio sources.As for noise cancellation, again great. Couldn't even hear myself talking while playing, but everyone could clearly hear me. I also checked the volume on my Twitch stream and that was crystal clear as well.And that's a great segway to reviewing the microphone which is advertised as noise cancelling. It delivers crisp, clear audio to other players and your stream. I even had my TV sound on, but you couldn't hear an echo or distortion in the mic audio.As for the LED lights, I imagine these are best for PC players. This requires a USB port to plug into near the audio port to power, so if you're plugging the headset into a controller (XB1X here), you can't plug in the USB without some kind of extension.

I then plugged it into my pc directly and the sound quality was fixed. (this is the reason I rated 3 stars sound quality instead of 4)Things I like about this headset:the adjustable volume: it has a volume slider (not sure if that is the right word)the mic: most other headsets I see have mics with bendy wires, and I think this design looks much better.the lights: they look really neat, but don't expect to be using them on a mobile device, as you need to use the USB cable to power the LEDs.the flexibility: the headset is bendable, I don't see any reason for this but I also don't see any reason to not have it, so why not?the noise reduction: noise-canceling works fairly well, but don't expect it to be the absolute best.Things I Don't like (could be improved):The mic: when moving the mic up and down, quite a bit of force is required. it would be better if it moved a little easier.the comfort: I've been wearing them for a few hours, and it's getting a bit uncomfortable, but not unbearably so.all in all, I'd say if you don't have the money to buy an expensive headset like me, this would be a great headset for you. at under 30$ (on the current sale), it's a steal.","Really good for the price, but don't expect it to compare to a 200$ headset.",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

I'd certainly pick these over just a basic single-ear headset with microphone, and I'd be inclined to purchase a pair of these over a high-priced set.I bought these because I was looking for something better than a basic, single-ear Xbox One headset that I could use for gaming. I wanted something that sounded decent and had a nice mic so I could communicate with other players. I was also hoping to find something with surround sound that wasn't overly expensive. This offered that. The sound quality of these sound great IMO and they are comfortable to wear, covering my ears well. It is difficult to hear room noise with these. I thought the LEDs were kinda cool, but really, if I'm wearing them, it isn't like I see them on myself, so I don't necessarily care too much whether they light up or not. It does require that you plug in the USB cord for those to work, however, so for something like the Xbox, where the audio cable is plugged in to the controller for game chat, you'll need a USB extension cable to plug the USB cord into to reach a USB port someplace. Again, I don't necessarily care if the lights are on or not, so this isn't a factor for me and was not a primary deciding factor in the purchase. If I want the LEDs, I can just get a USB extension cable. I don't see it as a negative for me, but if you want LEDs, you'd probably wish that the USB cable wasn't bundled with the audio cable. For a single-user PC, this wouldn't be as much of an issue, because everything would be right there; this is something primarily that would impact someone using it with a controller for gaming.Speaking of the PC, I was impressed that this came with the connector for the Xbox (audio and mic all-in-one) and included a splitter adapter that would allow connecting to separate mic and headphone ports, like a PC would have. This is not my use case, but if I was looking for something for the PC, these would be nice for that, too.There is an inline volume control with a mute switch.  The volume is a wheel control, which is nice for quick volume adjustment, and the housing for it is fairly big compared with other inline controls. It doesn't bother me that it is big. I actually like it because it is bigger, making it easier to find when you want to adjust things, and I also don't feel like it is so tiny and cheap that it will break apart on me if I so much as look at it. The only really negative thing I'd have to comment on is the mute switch. It is not readily apparent if you are muted or not with just the headset controls. There is a red dot next to the switch, but it isn't clear if that means you're muted or not. Once I figured out which way was which, then it wasn't a problem and the switch worked just fine. I recall that when the switch is pushed toward the red dot, the mic is live, which differs a bit from a standard xbox controller, providing both red (mute) and green (live) colors. It is possible to mute several different ways on the Xbox (I can mute in the Xbox party controls or the keypad the mic plugs into on the controller), so this is why a clear label or indication of the switch position would be more helpful.I played Destiny 2 with these and could hear noises move around me, so the surround sound apparently works. I could also hear in-game footsteps I did not hear as clearly before when playing just with the TV.The headphones also have a nice, sturdy feel to the over-the-head band, so I don't feel like the thing would snap or break apart on me. There is nice, thick, soft padding on the band itself for greater comfort.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. I can play comfortably, participate in in-game chat, and improve my game with better sound clarity than the TV.",Impressed: comfortable and good sound.,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

The sound quality is great, and I can use them for both my PC and Xbox as they include the adapter for the PC Mic/Audio ports. My only major issue is that I wear glasses, and the way the headphones sit on my head is not extremely comfortable. I cannot wear them for extended periods of time, as I used to wear my HYPER-X Stinger headset. Another minor gripe I have is the lights are USB powered, and the USB is right next to the headphone jack. Doesn't affect PC gaming at all - but it's a bit annoying to have the USB dangling around the Xbox controller. I use a twist tie to hold it together with the mic plug.

What’s important to know is that this is for PC use.General:I had an adapter so I didn’t need to buy a new one. The product details say that you need an adapter for certain devices, so I wanted to remind that you do need one for the pc. They’re cheap, just don’t forget.The cable itself for plugging is a little over seven feet just like the product details. I think this length is fair and not too long. You can walk around just fine.Sound:The surround sound is good. What I would recommend is logging in to the games you frequent and tweak the sound to make it sound best for you. There were a couple sounds that were a little quiet like thunder and some other sound effects, but overall, it’s really good.Voices in videos, streams and games is perfect. Music is also great.Comfort:The microphone takes a little effort to move, but hardly anything bad. I was used to my previous headsets being quick to move, so it was just a little different.I think I have a big head, so the size for the price was concerning when I bought it, but it fits fine and is comfortable.Noise Cancellation:Noise cancellation is a big thing for me. Not being able to hear people yell at the referees in the game doing something they don’t agree with, dogs barking (from inside the house) being quieter, or having loud people over is great. While this feature is standard, it’s still quality from my experience.LED:The LED cord is a USB that is shorter than the cable jacks. This isn’t an issue for PC when the USB plug ins is so close together. I’m not going to be taking advantage of this feature, but it’s nice to have. You’ll have to unplug it every time you want to turn it off as it doesn’t have a switch.What’s different from my previous Headset:I had two previous headsets from the same company. This headset was around 40$ so when it broke the same way twice, I wanted a change. What I was looking for was something durable around the ear speakers so when I set it down on my chair, the plastic wouldn’t crack, break, then dangle and need to be replaced.I found the price and features of this one appealing, so I got it. We’ll just have to see if it lasts over a year like the previous ones, but I’m pretty impressed so far.All in all, good purchase for the price and I hope it lasts me a long time.",Pretty good headset for the price.< Review for PC > DO NOT FORGET TO GET AN ADAPTER,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

I tried troubleshooting these issues and it all came back to the headset.Looking through other reviews I found that other people had similar issues to mine with feedback and audio quality/failure.

The volume control wheel partway down the cord works fine.My only complaint is that there seems to be something small rattling loose in the left ear piece, but unless I'm shaking my head I wouldn't hear it. I like the headset enough to let it slide.Overall, this seems like a really solid headset for the price, I've had an excellent experience with it so far, and would highly recommend to anyone just starting to get into this type of equipment. If I was already used to higher brand items I might have more to fuss about, but in my limited experience I think it's great.","Sturdy, Comfortable, Great Mic",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

As for the audio, the sound is very crisp and clear and there is a good, even distribution between both sides. I'm very content with the quality.

I've had a similar issue with another RUNMUS headset previously, so I don't really know if the problem is with the product or my device. That aside, I still believe this is redeemable because of its good audio quality and comfort (I do have a rather large head, and it fits snugly). The LED lights on the headset are also controlled by the USB jack, so if you don’t want to have them on, you can simply not plug it in. You won’t see a USB icon or disk driver appear if you do decide to plug it in as it only controls the lights.-EDIT- I managed to solve the mic problem by unplugging the mic cable. For some reason, having it plugged in lowered the sensitivity.

It looks bulky but I think that's the way it has to be for gaming headsets. I have another brand of headset that was a little bit more expensive but this one is better. I compared both of them playing the same game (RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2) which has a lot of different sound effects I didn't even heard before on my TV.  I set the game sound to the headset. I was amazed and little scared of every one of the sounds of this game that I could hear. You can actually hear your enemy (a bear) walking towards you before even see it.

I'm someone who doesn't want to spend much unless I know it's quality. If I'm in a store looking for headphones I'll either buy the pair of sennheisers i like best, or I'm with the $8 sony earbuds. I'm okay with cheap and I'll pay for quality. These are a lot of quality for the low.Start to finish:Packaging - Box is run of the mill, there's too much going on, if it was in a big lots I probably wouldn't have looked twice at it. There's a few misspelling but the fact that it actually lists its compatibility and audio specs on it is a great sign. Nothing in the box is loose and it'd be pretty hard to get damaged during shipping.Set-up - Plus and play, for ps4 go to system settings -> devices -> audio devices -> output to headphones and change it to all audio. Says this clearly in the manual, takes about 10 seconds tops. No issue at all. Usb or seperate headphone/mic adapter are included as well for easy pc hook up. Xbox might be difference but if you bought an xbox, then you probably won't buy this anyways because you make bad decisions.Comfort - shape is perfect, not too tight, i much prefer the padding that this has to the elastic bands that some of the others have. Had to laugh today when i tried on a $150 pair at.. A well known computer store in Detroit.. And preferred the way the random $20 headset i gambled on in Amazon fit. Only complaint compared to high end? Couple grams too heavy, not enough to matter, and the pads could be a bit softer. On a $100 headset, maybe 4/5. On a $20 headset? 5/5.Sound - This was the real surprise, I've tried astro a10's, a few logitechs, a bunch of different turtle beaches and a kraken headset and this beats them all by a mile. Highs and mids are clear and tight, if I hooked it to something with an equalizer to turn down the bass then I'd probably take this over any midrange bose, beats or skullcandy headphones as well. The heavy bass isn't an issue, but if you're into hi-fi or an audiophile (I'm not, but I've heard enough quality and enough garbage to know the difference) then imbalance always sticks out. The 7.1 surround sound is wonderfully accurate, it does a great job with keeping sounds distinct even when there's tons of stuff going on. It doesn't compare to the artis pro steel series, sennheisers, hi-fi man, or even a couple hidden gem koss headphones I've tried (open back koss), but realistically these could easily compete in the $80 range. The noise canceling could do with some work too, but I just turn them up and enjoy. After 2 hours of it at 3/4 I never ended up with fatigue from having them so high.Build quality / durability - this is my only concern. I assume if these don't take a fall they'll be wonderful for ages, and the feel like they can take a little fall and be fine, but since there's no flexibility to them and it is made of a harder plastic any hard hit or say a child going to jump on the couch... Might do them in. The positive note? Instead of being out $50-$150 for any other decent headset, you're only out $20.If every headset under $200 was $50? These would be 3.75-4/5 and I'd say get the gameones, steel series, or gsp.At $20-25? 5/5, order two.",$20? Order two.,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

They are bulky, strong, soft on the ears, beautiful, top quality for the dollar.The sound: It does not oversell the surround sound, you will hear everything from every direction as if you were in the battlefield of the badlands. The quality of sound is beautiful as well, not muffling or diluting despite size, crisp and fresh. Noise cancellation? You'll be able to hear enough outside to make sure no one is going to play a game of SAW with you but give you peace of mind. Want more control of volume? No sweat, it comes with a small volume wheel.The mic: Wonderful work of art. Ignores outside sounds (except mechanical keyboard clicks of a certain type, those are loud.) You will be heard clearly, you will be clearly understandable and able to communicate with the most effect compared to other headsets, and is good at making sure only you are heard. Need to insta-mute that mic? It comes with a button that turns it off before anyone can hear what's going on.How does it feel? It surrounds and cups the ear, instead of pressing tightly against the tips and giving those horrible headaches. It gives your ears breathing room and the protein foam for the top of your skull is so pleasant that you can easily forget it's even there. The mic is comfortable to move around without getting in my way. Out of mind, the only thing you'll focus on is the sound blessing your ears. Want to wear it for three days in a row in your chair without visiting the bathroom and having a system of snacks and drinks at your desk for that ultimate WoW session? Go right ahead, it won't feel any different than when you put it on to begin with.Will they break easily? NO. These things are built like tanks for your skull, if you drop it, it will brush it off and laugh at the poor attempt to even crack it. This thing might even be a good tool for self defense with how strong it is, these aren't poor quality materials.How does it look? It looks like you're about to perform an impossible feat on your new favorite game. It's beautifully designed, has a red glare that will bring fear into your fellow gaming buddies when you hear their every breath in the game. They are equipped for any situation, they are scary to be against, and highly fashionable to show off and brag to your fellow gamers on Twitch and Steam. They are thick, but that makes this beast seem even bigger and more dominating than those sad little Skullcandy mobile headphones.What can I use it on? If it has either a USB port or can take those little round plugs, congratulations, this works on it. PC is what I use it on, but if I wanted to I could use it on any other single device a gamer could ever imagine using. Even old systems take this beast and let them in, it is perfect.Price vs Quality: Anything that claims to be better will either be a liar or something extraordinarily developed and thus be very costly. This competes with other more costly ""top rated"" headphones. This packs the features, the looks, the comfort, and the durability all for a considerable price that anyone would be right to simply choose this on first sight. I almost was a foolish mortal and thought about others, but no, I made the right choice to take this set and buy it. If it ever breaks I will be surprised and heartbroken. It has improved everything in my games, I cannot possibly appreciate any headphones more than this.You will regret not knowing what beauty is here before you by buying some lame headset for more of a price, because I feel very comfortable that this one will certainly out compete it without a SINGLE QUESTION. Buy it sooner than later, TREAT YOURSELF. I will be getting another for my brother without a doubt.","good quality,  amazing price",Color: RedVerified Purchase,

So trust me when I say that I use the hell out of these headphones. I’ve had everything from Astro a 50s that are $400, to the cheapest $15 headphones you can buy just about anywhere. I paid $16 for these when they were on sale and I was so incredibly pleasantly surprised. First off, they are some of the most, if not the most comfortable headphones I’ve ever worn.  Second, No, they aren’t the most insanely over boosted audio headsets out there. But what they do delivery is shockingly impactful base at higher volume, clear  and immersive  sound delivery, all while being relatively low weight. They completely cover your ears and don’t give you headaches across where the band rests atop your head like most headphones out there.  There are honestly, truthfully, only two things that bothered me about these headphones. The first being that a plastic  decorative piece at the end of the microphone was not properly attached so it rattled incessantly if I bumped it, which consequently could also be heard by the people in my party chat. My second gripe being that  as convenient as the 6 foot, nylon braided cord may seem on paper, it was kind of a pain in the ass with it just plugged into the controller in my lap. If I moved around a lot, the cord would get caught on things or we just flat out be annoying to deal with. BUT! These are minuscule when it comes to the overall  Quality and reliability and performance you get from such a low cost headset.  PLEASE take a chance on these.

On this front, it's at least as good as headsets that cost twice as much.Pros:- Good mic quality. Don't try to record a podcast with it, but more than good enough for any gaming related communication needs.- Pads are too new to say how they'll hold up long term, but they're comfortable and isolate well. They appear to be some sort of styrofoam covered in faux leather.-Surround sound appears to work. At the very least I can play overwatch and hear where footsteps came from.-Braided cable with a built in cable tie and thick couplers between cable and plugs. I wouldn't expect these to have the loose connection failure mode that most 3 mm jacks develop anytime soon.-They're built like a tank. Every component I've tried to bend is sturdy while obviously being designed to bend at the same time.Cons:- It conforms to the shape of your head via a flexible headband rather than having the cups on a swivel ala ATH-M50s. This works acceptably well, but the headband is kind of stiff so I personally have to accept only having one cup fully covering my ear. The headband is ridiculously bendy with some effort though, so your mileage may vary.-Sound quality isn't great. About what you'd expect from a pair of headphones in this price range, especially given that they're true 7.1, but you don't want to be listening to music with these. Good enough for competitive gaming here.-Slightly heavy. This is endemic to 7.1 headsets in general, but worth noting.-Double 3mm jack required. Not a deal breaker, but it doesn't have the chip required to make USB send and receive audio data. USB port is simply for powering the LEDs (optional).Overall, I couldn't be happier. The first con is the only one I'd really consider to be a legitimate problem with them, but if my budget headset only has one real con, I'm more than happy with the purchase. I was looking for a gaming headset, and it does that job at least as well as much more expensive headsets.",Good deal overall,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

I receive a seemingly automated message expressing concern with my review and asking for details on the issues. (The details I listed in the review). They also proceeded to request a 5 star customer service rating. Since I have been receiving a lot of new spam in my e-mail. I am crediting this to Runmus selling my e-mail address. I have since dropped my rating of a 3 based purely on the product to a 1 based on otherwise poor company communication and increased spam after communicating with them.The headset comes with adjustable settings but the headset itself is a little big to start with and doesn't fit super comfortable though still usable.. The ear padding seems like it might be a little light in stuffing and the headphones don't do much but slightly mute outside sounds without sound playing. The microphone sits a little high for my liking, even on the lowest setting as it is always in the corner of my vision.  It is a little better if I lean the headset forward on my head but with it being a little loose on my head it doesn't hold still as well.  Top Volume is  not particularly loud either. Looks like I may need to go a price point up.",Update,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Noise cancellation leaves something to be desired, as I could hear things from outside pretty well and they could hear me. Seeing as these are ""Open back"" though that is not a surprise, this is something that type of headphone is known for.Be warned that if you are looking for big booms from explosions and great bass you won't find that in these.

Sure I could tape it but meh, lazy.My brother suggested I get a headset, so I took a look. Amazon was rating this pretty well.  Other reviewers gave some pretty good insight on the look, feel, sound.  I'm not one for lights, but red/black is my color combo of choice.  So I took a chance.  Bought the headset, and a splitter (cause from all that I could tell, it didn't have one).Got yesterday.  It's a bit chunky, but after a few hours of wear, I couldn't tell I was wearing it.I played around with the sound settings on my PC.  This headset puts out some really good sound.  And it can handle bass very well.  If you have a sound card or on-board sound that can do 5.1/7.1, these headsets feel like they can give you that sound directional and audio.To a point, I play Star Trek: Online. It's got a lot of ambience, little sounds hear and there, with distance and such.  Running around a ship or a base, you can hear just little things.  One place was interesting, as I had been in several times.  But I never heard ships or battle rumbling outside.  These headphones?  I was freaking out a little bit.The lighting effects on the headphones are neat, but to me, novel.  You need to plug into a USB port to get them to work, that's it.  I haven't really played around with the headphones to see if there's some way to ease the lights, so I just ended up not plugging in the USB.  This does not and I repeat DOES NOT affect your sound at all.  It's just for powering up the lights.So overall, its a great buy.Also - it comes with a splitter for single headphone jack.

The 3.5 millimeter audio can plug into your controller, and it also come with two separate audio and mic jacks if you need to plug the headset directly into your PC.Overall this headset is a great bang for your buck, and outperforms every other 30 dollar headset it it's class by a mile.

They do not hug at the bottom, which makes them just a tad awkward, but you get used to it. 2. The inline thumb-wheel volume control has some serious dead spots in it. This has become an issue.

That being said, the review will still be completely honest.As far as shipping goes, I ordered it on Tuesday expecting to receive them Friday, but the arrived on Thursday, a whole day early. I thoroughly appreciate companies with super fast shipping so it was a nice surprise.Out of the box, I noticed they were much larger than I expected them to be, and they don't quite sit on my ears right. They hang down a little low, but are still comfortable, so I'm not too worried about. They just might work better for people with larger heads.The sound is pretty good, but I wouldn't consider them noise cancelling. I use them when playing games and talking on discord, and since my husband and I play in the same room, we mute each other because it's easier to hear each other in person, and I don't need to remove the headphones to do so. So, they work well for our purposes.The mic seems to work well, as I had no complaints from anyone in our discord group, and it doesn't seem to pick up any unwanted background noise, which is great.Aesthetically, they are a little clunky and plasticy, but functionality wise, they do exactly what I hoped they'd do.

I am a very casual gamer, and really only wanted to listen to music with nice headphones that could double as a headset for the few occasions when I actually play. Being my first decent headset I've ever owned, I was very, very happy with how clean and clear the audio is - exactly what I was looking for in the product.One problem I've had with other headphones in the past was the cord getting caught on something causing the cord to be semi-ripped out of the set, ruining the sound and breaking the headphones... but I can tell these are not going to have that problem. The part of the cord going into the set is reinforced with very sturdy rubber, keeping the cord firmly in place. It would probably take the strength of several people to actually rip the cord out of these things.No batteries required is a nice bonus.I don't game often but when I do, the microphone seems to work quite well - no complaints yet. The only thing about this headset that may bother some people is that the mic attachment only folds down when they are worn with the mic over your left ear. If you really prefer the mic on the right side of your head, it will not fold down both ways, only when worn with the mic on your left. It does not bother me, but it may for some.The USB plug powers the red lights on the headset, so if you prefer the lights off, that is easily done by unplugging the USB and leaving the audio plugged in.All in all a great headset, it does the job I need it to do very well. I am very pleased.",Great headset for gaming and music,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Took a chance with this one after reading the reviews and for the price, I had nothing to lose. Received the headset after just two days and I couldn't be happier. They fit nicely and since my ears are not huge, the headphone cups fit perfectly without really smashing my ears so I think they are very comfortable and have played for over an hour at a time with no problems. I'm not one to spend 2+ hours in one session so I can't speak on how they feel for hours of straight use but I honestly think I could wear this for hours without discomfort. The sound quality is amazing with so much depth. Feels like I'm literally in the game. Didn't think it could make a difference but it does. How does RUMNUS make a profit selling this thing for such a low price compared to top name brands. If you love to play games and are looking for a headset, you may like these but if you are just a casual gamer or are on the fence of getting a headset, don't hesitate. Get these and you won't be disappointed.Pros:- Comfortable- Doesn't smash ears- Noise cancellation is decent- Sound quality is great- Improves in game experience- Mic is clear according to my friends on the other end (no feedback or picking up nearby noises)- VALUE (can't beat the price)Cons:- The mic isn't super flexible but I don't care- Its wired which I knew when I bought it so not really a con",Can't Beat the Value!,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

The mic quality is very nice from when I transmit it back to myself and will be wonderful to use with friends. Sound quality from videos is perfect, though I am yet to test it in-game. Other reviews said the surround sound feature was not the best, but if that ends up being the case, I honestly couldn't be mad due to the high quality of this headset.

The quality of the sound is very good.The differences are as follows, with new one in red on the left of the picture and old one in blue on the right:+ the mic on the new model is slimmer and with no foam, the foam keeps coming off in the old one so it’s an improvement- the microphone’s arm length and bend ability are less good on the new model, making it hard to position close enough to the mouth to completely prevent it from picking up background noise. That’s the biggest negative point and the main thing I prefer in the old model+ despite that, the quality of the mic is good and the background noise is minimal+ like previous model it comes with a mic/speaker splitter+ the cord is very long on both models. In the olde models it tends to get twisted and get kinks and I hope the new model has a cord that solves this problem.

Having used it for 8 months, I have yet to encounter any significant problems with this headset. Qualitative-wise, it boasts a sturdy build, which while it does make it lean more towards the heavy side, it does mean that it can take quite a bit of punishment. It features a 4-foot long braided cable, which while short, is extremely durable, and a very good, albeit stiff and rubbery microphone attached via an axle that swivels vertically.Unfortunately, this headset falls short in two important areas: sound quality and independent volume control. The sound that the speakers emit is oftentimes muffled, although not to a severe or intolerable degree. Likewise, there is no independent sensitivity or input volume control for the mic, or the level of bass for the speakers, which, given the value of the product, should not come of any surprise. Noise cancellation, however, is pretty good.Compatibility-wise, I've been able to use the headset on both my Windows 8 and 10 PCs. Installation is straightforward, as it did not require any manufacturer-specific drivers. Just hook it up correctly and that's it.While it definitely falters in some areas, sound quality being the most notable, this is a great budget alternative for people interested in getting a headset, but unwilling to commit to such an exorbitant investment.

Having had more success with a cheap HyperX headset, I figured I'd keep buying on the cheaper end considering they last as long or longer than the more expensive ones.Pros :- I hear the bass and other low sounds much better than on the Sennheiser. I'm not an audiophile, so that's the only thing that stood out to me. The rest sounded the same.- The lighting is eye candy, though I kind of wished it turned off with the computer.Subjective :- The cable is super short. Perfect for me since I can't accidentally roll on it with my chair, but could inconvenience others. For instance with my habit of just setting down the headset on the desk I've already often come close to accidentally pulling it down and onto the keyboard or floor.Cons :- It feels like I need to place them on my head *just* right for the ears to be comfortable.- Even when I do find the sweetspot, it won't be as comfortable as other headsets.- Even though the mic is a swivel, you can't mute yourself by tilting it up. You need to use the on-cable controls (or go through your system's settings).Get this if you're on a budget and don't mind slight ear discomfort that your brain will likely tune out during long sessions (and sometimes tune back in once you take them off).

The surround sound is great and helps you pin down enemies. Heck, even Minecraft has good surround sound through these.

Mic cancels background noises like people talking/TV noticeably well. While wearing them you can still hear your surroundings like 90%, so I don't know that I'd really call them sound canceling for the wearer. Once again though, the mic is masterful at canceling background if you're using these for gaming or recording.The headset is a little heavy which made them uncomfortable until I got used to them, and the plastic feels cheap, but they look really cool. I'm worried that if you didn't get used to them while playing games for hours, it might start to get uncomfortable. This is my first pair of gamer headphones though, so if you've owned a pair before that wasn't made for comfort you probably already know that feeling.I love them for my setup. They feel like professional headphones but are a very reasonable price. The glowing is sweet, you need an extra USB slot for it though.

I don't know how other buyers gave good stars on this headset. The cushions for comfortable, I have no complaints and also the sound quality. I try it for 5-10 minutes and put back in the box because I feel dizzy. I haven't try and see if the microphone works. But I know that this headset definitely not for me. I ask my son to try on and see if he like it then he can keep it but he doesn't want it after put it on for less than a minute.",Too heavy and bulky...,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

Truth be told, I would have done it without any outside motivation.  After years of service, my on-ear gaming headset gave up the ghost. I take exceptional care of my gear so I was disappointed when the cable separated at the connection to the 3.5 mm plug. As you can see by the attached photo, that won't be happening again any time soon since my new Run Mus headset has a beefy cable with a braided strain relief shroud. In fact, beefy is a perfect way to describe these earphones. Unlike their predecessor, these heavy-weights completely cover my ears instead of resting on top. The silence is deafening and I mean that in a good way. Now I can fully appreciate the surround sound with booming bass and clear highs. The payoff has been an amazing increase in spatial orientation, situational awareness and most importantly K:D ratio. Nobody is sneaking up behind this guy anymore! They came with more than enough connection options and plug straight in to my xbox 1 controller. I get my choice of 6 gifts but you know what? I may just get another headset in a different color. Yeah, it's THAT good.",Substantial...feel and sound,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

If you hold the cord just right you can avoid the static. But the slightest movement brings on the worst noise. I would not recommend this headset. I had another one that was a $25 one thatasted for about a year but the cord wore out at the connection to my controller. It was perfect.

That's about the only comparison I can give as otherwise I just use speakers or earbuds.  Here's a stream of thoughts I have on this headset:- Audio quality is great.  I use it for gaming and I can clearly hear my teammates without sacrificing the audio of the game- Set up is easy: just plug in the USB, mic, and audio jack and everything worked like a charm- Others have said the mic quality is solid- Definitely has good noise cancelling.  I have a house with two kids, a dog, and birds and that world basically vanished with this bad boy on- A critique might be the big bulky look. I personally don't mind it, even though I probably look ridiculous.  Turn on the LEDs so everyone knows you're a PRO GAMERReally I think it's a super headset for the price!  Can't go wrong with it.",Quality Headset,Color: RedVerified Purchase,

The inline volume and microphone mute feature comes in handy so you don’t have to fumble with in-game volume settings. The headset is very bulky but is still fairly light and everything—including the led lights  (powered by the usb cable only), works as advertised. The 7.1 surround sound is an incredible feature, especially if you’re into first person shooters like call of duty, because you can hear every and any direction your enemy is coming from. The majority of the headset is plastic and fits over your ears but if you have a smaller head, it probably won’t sit very tightly. As for noise cancellation, i think it performs for its price range. You’ll still be able to hear a low muffled version of your surroundings with no sound coming through the headphones but when immersed in gameplay, the game is mostly what you’ll hear. I think it’s a good buy and I would recommend these gaming headsets if you’re looking for a pair that sound great with no feedback or static, fits over your ears, is flexible and durable, 7.1 surround sound (a must for heavy gamers) and won’t break the bank.",Performs Well For The Price!,Color: RedVerified Purchase,
