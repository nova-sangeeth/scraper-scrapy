This review is for ""All-new Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote (includes *SOME* TV controls) | HD streaming device | 2020 release"" This is the 1080p model . I do not own, nor need support for 4K. My eyesight isn't fantastic, and I can enjoy 1080p on a 46"" screen just fine.I have a previous generation Fire Stick that I use for one of the bedroom TVs.My wife quickly overran the meager 8GB internal memory on the original Fire Stick, and at the time I checked it out, the original did NOT support USB flash drives as any sort of storage. Reading the Q&A here with these and yes, it seemed flash drives via a USB OTG cable were supported now on this model, not the older one. I plugged in the new fire stick, powered it up, and did the initial configuration and grabbed the latest updates. THEN I turned it off, unplugged the power, plugged in a USB OTG cable, make sure it has male, and female micro USB and a regular USB female port, plug in the flash drive, then my Fire stick ethernet adapter as I prefer wired eithernet over WiFi for reliability sake / less lag.... and lastly plug the power feed back in and turn it all on... I get prompted to format, so I formatted to device storage.Mind you, this Fire Stick shows 6GB instead of the old 8GB, NOT an improvement, but it supports a 128GB flash drive as device storage but shows 121GB, I figure the new version of FireOS is counting storage funny. Either way I have at least 126 GB of total storage for apps and data. Not going to hold my movies on it, but it sure won't run out of space for apps.The older fire stick wasn't super stable either. Closing apps and opening new ones like switching from Hulu to Prime Video would often crash it requiing a reboot. No instability noticed at all with this one.Operational response such as mentioned above is not only more stable, but noticably faster. I don't know if the specs changed that much, but it sure does seem to run quicker with far less wait / load time for apps.The remote is new as well. Not sure what they did other than more integrated TV control, but the mic for the Alexa remote works much better than previous versions.  But where it really has improved, but has a ways to go still is TV control. I can change volume, and of course bring up the Fire stick, but being able to change inputs, and change channels on live OTA TV is still in dream territory for me here. It is nice however when streaming movies and web shows to not have to dig up the TV remote to change the volume.... And of course the ability to handle this via Alexa is nice too...For my TV I switch between the fire stick a PS4, a Wii (Yeah I still use one of those), and an Atari Flashback, I still need a TV remote. Hopefully some day Amazon will upgrade the remote for this to integrate those controls somehow....",Almost perfect.,Configuration: Fire TV StickVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,2511,486,6530,Public

I opened the package, plugged it into a spare HDMI port, and connected it to power.  The screen indicated it was waiting to pair with the remote so I installed the included batteries.  The remote quickly paired and the next screen was to select my language.  I selected the English default and it then indicated it was checking for software updates.  What the heck?  It never asked me for WiFi credentials so how could it look for updates?  And then it was downloading the update, from I didn't know where.  It installed the update, restarted, and downloaded another update.  At this point I was really confused.  The second software update installed and then it restarted one more time.  And this time, it had my name on the screen, asking me if I wanted to use my Prime account or enter a different one.  How did it know?  I had entered exactly zero user information, zero WiFi network information, and it simply connected to my network and connected to my Prime account.  This was so easy!  But, how could it do this?  It then asked me to try the remote volume control confirm it worked with the TV sound.  It worked.  It never even asked me what model TV it was connected to.  When I clicked the remote power button, the TV turned off.  Again, how did it know how to control the TV?The only thing I can figure is the new Fire TV Stick scanned for other Fire TV Sticks over an alternate WiFi channel, connected to an older Fire TV Stick we have, and retrieved the account and connection information.  If so, this is brilliant!As for the TV pairing, I suspect that while it was transmitting different audio tones during setup, it was transmitting different TV remote audio control commands while the remote microphone was listening for volume changes.  When it sensed a change, it had found the correct TV remote encoding.  Again, brilliant!Setup can not get any easier than this.  It works great!EDIT:  Upon further research, I found that Amazon can save your account and WiFi credentials in the cloud to automatically connect new devices, so perhaps this information was configured into the device when ordered.",Scary freaky simple automatic configuration!,Configuration: Fire TV StickVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,60,16,2241493,Public

Thinking about it further I realized that the WiFi probably was the issue. And I know it isn't my system as I have an enterprise grade Access Point WiFi system. What changed my mind was Prime Video was having issues with slow downs. It never buffered, but the picture would get pixelated. But, on the other hand, the Fire Stick in a WiFi speed test next to two Android TV systems was much slower. So, I don't know, really, if it was a design issue or a defective unit. Besides, I didn't like the fact that the home page wasn't customizable, at all. So, I am returning the unit and getting something else with Android TV. Amazon has a good thing, going. But, they are trying to lock things down too much. If they would make the home screen customizable, I think it would be a nice unit.

The interface looked more appealing to me than the 3rd generation Apple TV I currently own, and it was only 40 bucks so I picked one up.Pros:-Setup is a breeze as long as you have a good network connection.-There is a ton of free content that is advertised to you. This is neat if you like watching free TV.-The remote is fantastic. I have a 1080P dumb TV that has no CEC for its HDMI, so I need an infrared remote to control the on/off for the TV and soundbar. The FireTv remote works flawlessly for this. Kudos Amazon! I can simply hit the power button on the remote and everything powers up or down simultaneously. I could not do this with the Apple TV remote.-The interface in my opinion is easy to use as I was able to learn how to navigate around in minutes. Also, there are a ton of YouTube videos that go over how to use FireTV for anyone interested in watching.Cons:-I use ATT TV for my main TV service. It says it works with live TV, but all I see is an app. I‚Äôm not sure I understand how this works with live TV. Also, for whatever reason some channels load incredibly slow with the ATT TV app. Other apps are slow to load for whatever reason. I checked the network connection and it says it‚Äôs very good. Plus, on my Apple TV which sits on the same stand I have no problems with things loading.-The actual news App which looked promising in the store will not load at all. I‚Äôve updated to the latest update but still nothing happens. Bummer!-The picture looks nice, but can be extremely over saturated. I‚Äôve been able to adjust some of this in the display settings..... but it‚Äôs still a work in progress.Overall, for 40 bucks it‚Äôs hard to beat this thing.

We got this with the intention of just having a few apps that he and the rest of the family can watch.  We were going to have the parental controls set so nothing could be downloaded without a pin, but allow access to all downloaded apps so all family members, (including him) could access different apps without constantly typing a pin.  We went so far as to remove items from our cloud because apparently there is NO option to block apps already in your cloud.  It was all going well until we got to the pre-installed IMBd tv app.For most families, this is a great app.  Free movies and TV shows with ads.  For us, not so much.  The viewing restrictions do not apply to this PRE-INSTALLED APP!!  Why take away the option of removing this from this device if the parental controls DO NOT APPLY TO IT!?The worst part is this Fire Stick would have been PERFECT if this app could be removed form the device and cloud.  Now we're stuck with the options of needing to input a code EVERY SINGLE TIME we need to open an app, or leaving it be and hope our special needs family member with the mind of a child doesn't find it.  I'll talk to my family, but chances are we'll be returning this and asking for a full refund.Bottom line:  If you take parental control seriously, skip this device.  Unless you want to input a pin every time you open an app because someone didn't have the foresight to allow consumers to remove an app with R rated content with no parental control.","If you take parental control seriously, skip this device.",Configuration: Fire TV StickVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,8,18,3598038,Public

On tvs that are publicly accessible i set up parental controls so that my grandkids wouldn't inadvertently or knowingly purchase on line content  BUT there √¨s a problem. Now whenever they want to change the streaming service they are watching i need to go in and change the service with my code. When I contacted customer service i was told that there is no way to restrict the access to just purchases. So now, that the code needs to be entered for all streaming service changes. The problem is that even adults mess up navigation through the system and because we were on a tv with no parental controls we inadvertently charged a show that we didn't even watch! When I called Amazon they were nice enough to credit my account this time but i don't want the aggravation of having to do this over and over again (because it will undoubtedly happen again) not the worry that Amazon might refuse it next time ago because i can't lock out only purchases on my firestick. So my options are: 1) turn on parental controls on all of my fire sticks so that i am inconvenienced hourly or 2) risk being charged for items that are not internationally bought.I am not writing this so much to dissuade using or buying the fire stick, but rather to alert Amazon of the problem with their device software. I hope that they will see this because so far this product seems to fit my needs but at a price!The only other issue is that the feature of connecting to my echo device is very limited on what scrounge it can actually do. I have looked on the app and found several commands that it can do but have no clue how to simply have Alexa did simple tasks like moving the cursor and activating the current highlighted item.

I do not know if there was some lag in the transmission from the remote to the device, or if I have a faulty remote.

This has become more of a problem, as most modems/routers use a combined signal system, automatically switching between 2.4 and 5 ghz depending on signal strength and such, where most Alexa enabled devices require a specific 2.4 channel. (this is changing as more of the accessories are becoming 5.0 capable)  I fixed this by adding a second older router as a hub, that has separate addresses for each network speed.

The first one I purchased when the product was first available. Overall, the device works as a good platform for Prime Video and the countless apps one can get.However, I have experienced frustrating issues with all four Fire Sticks that I have purchased over the years.1. The back of the remote control never stays firmly on. There seems to be a design flaw so that the back cover of the remote control never snaps firmly in place.2. Remote Control Connection Issues:  Most often seen when I select the ""Home"" key on the remote. I litterally have to press this key a dozen times or more before the Fire TV Stick responds and goes ""Home"". This issue occurs often with my older devices and the  new one I just purchased. This issue occurs with fresh batteries in the remote control and when I move the remote within a couple of feet of the Fire TV unit.3. Compatibility with Alexa- I have the Hulu TV  and Netflix apps installed on my Fire TV. With the most recent (and older versions of the Fire Sticks I own), I was initially able to set-up the ""skill"" to use Alexa (via voice commands through my Echo Show) to interract with the Hulu app/Netflix on my Fire TV. But mysteriously after a few weeks of use, the ability to use voice commands no longer worked. Frustrating because if I check the settings on my Echo Show and on the Fire TV device, the ""skill"" for Hulu/Netflix still shows both are enabled.I would like to emphasize that I have experienced all of these issues frequently on the older and newer Fire TV devices I own.

I've been using fire TV sticks since about 8 years now and even the older version that they had I was hoping manure version would be more durable but they all end the same way. I have to replace these probably about two to three times a year even then it's cheaper than paying for cable. so I guess what I'm learning is that I can't just buy one I have to buy several so that I have backups for when the time comes. We don't necessarily need TV but on weekends me and my girls like to cuddle up on the couch and watch morning cartoons and there's nothing worse than waking up early in the morning getting ready to watch Nick Jr not even dressed yet just to find that it's not working I don't want to turn on the first indicator that you have is that it's starting to break is that it starts to overheat I tried to do regular cleanings on it watching how many apps I have making sure as time to be unplugged I have tried everything but they always on the same and they always end up overheating eventually and then just breaking. my oldest daughter has a Roku TV so everything that is on the fire TV stick is pretty much on this thing as well only you never have to worry about it breaking down because it's completely built into the TV and I'm thinking about in the future just getting one of those for the living room instead of continuously buying fire TV stick after fire TV stick they're just not durable whatsoever.,The only problem that I have is that they do not last long.,Configuration: Fire TV StickVerified Purchase,,165,92,78636428,Public

Flawless installation and fast, fast, fast! I also got the Mission Essentials USB power cable so I have one less power wart sucking up the E-juice. I'm using a borrowed Samsung Smart TV and was using with the Amazon Prime Video app - so slow to load the smart hub (3 minutes...), then slow to load the app (2-3 more minutes...), and then some slow buffering at low resolution for a minute or two before improving the picture. Ew. Hit the power button on the remote and the TV & stick fires up to the selection screen in 41 seconds, then it's a little woozy while I navigate down 2 rows and over 3 to Survivor, select that, and at 1:07 I'm watching those miserable people scrambling to survive for a million bucks! There's a little stuttering as it starts shoving data in the buffers, but that smooths out quickly. This is my 3rd Fire Stick, so I'm used to the interface. It's easy enough to find included content, but still frustrating that the search tool only works with a few select apps. Still, there's so much to watch that I can usually find an acceptable show (e.g. Chronicles of Riddick since Pitch Black isn't available, or Hell's Kitchen since no streaming service seems to have MasterChef). Controlling everything with an Alexa-enabled voice remote is pretty easy aside from having to navigate to letters when spelling something (I know, get a bluetooth keyboard, but that's just one more expense).

So, don't need the Fire Stick 'cause the Samsung can run the apps, right?  Well....Right away noticed that the Samsung-native apps loaded SIGNIFICANTLY slower than those run by the Fire Stick.  After some investigation I narrowed it down to Samsung having issues with our router's firewall and VPN.  Tried setting up exceptions for the Samsung but still had slow loads.  Additionally, Samsung's search feature wouldn't function at all unless I turned off our Syfer security.  No bueno!  Fire Stick on the other hand had no issues working through all the techno stuff to run apps and quick searches.So kudos  to Amazon for a decent device.  Not running voice recognition or Alexa integration (love Amazon but there ARE limits), so won't rate them.

Ordered new remote. While waiting for that I decided to see if my Echo (brand new 4th gen) would recognize fire stick. Hooray, it did, sort of. It will turn tv on and off and get me to specific channels but volume control is not supported?!  Finally new remote arrived.  Voice control works but not volume. When I use remote voice control it tells me Sharp smart tv (roku built in) does not support volume control. Well, yuck.)  So this is a half a loaf situation and will do for now.

First off I seen a lot of one-star reviews and I wanted to touch base on those the back of the remote cover took me less than a second to take off it was easy no problem anybody that had a problem has difficulties with electronics period second it is mostly for subscription services it has some or very little free services YouTube Tubi TV etc. TV/cable is not free. Third it advertises if you actually read it it does not support 4K it says that in the description and fourth the person who had it in Spanish and couldn't switch it to English must have been inpatient and was just pressing buttons rapidly at the startup it gives you a language option and it does come with 2 AAA batteries in the description it says batteries sold separately but two AAA batteries came in the box so now that I got that out of the way my own review it works very well I have a smart Vizo TV for my room and we have a regular HDTV for the living room I have to say the fire stick works better and faster than my smart TV loads instantly within 2-3 seconds and there is no buffering of the Video quality the voice command is a cool feature and you can control your TV power on/off and turn the volume up/down with the fire stick remote and the cool part is I didn't have to put in any code for the TV I just had to select my brand of TV üòÅ I can't find any downside to it if I do I'll be back to edit my review but so far it is a great product five stars out of five!,Awesome product!!,Configuration: Fire TV StickVerified Purchase,,0,4,,Public
