Carhartt stuff usually is. I haven't worn it out yet in the cold, but it feels thick and warm for a sweatshirt.A couple of slight cons though that made me drop it one star:Size - I'm 5'6'', 145lbs. I wear a small in most things. This in a small is a bit bigger than I'm used to though. Not to the point I can't wear it, but a tad bit bigger than what I prefer. It's a bit baggy on me, not the fitted/snugger feeling I usually go for. I'll keep it however, instead of going through the process of returning it. I could easily wear an extra small though in this. Looking at what's available though, extra small in this severely limits your options.Color - The image for the ""New Navy"" color on the website does not accurately depict the item. The website makes it appear to be a sort of brighter blue color, when in fact the sweatshirt I received is a very, very dark navy blue. Looking at the picture, it's almost as if I've been sent the wrong color, but I have no way of knowing that because nothing on the tags or labels makes any mention of the color of the hoodie.So overall, not exactly perfect, but I can't knock the item itself.
