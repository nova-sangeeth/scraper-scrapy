I often fall just between medium and large in shirts, jackets, etc.  I am 5'9"", 175 lb., 41 inch chest.  I prefer my hoodie to fit a little snug, not baggy.  I first ordered a large, thinking I'd maybe shrink it if it was too large.  But when it arrived it was so large that I was sure it wouldn't shrink that much, so I returned it and ordered a medium.  The medium fits me perfectly, to my slightly snug preference.  I haven't washed and dried it yet, but I'm confident that there is room for a little shrinking, and that it will stretch back out with a little wearing.

The fit, style and quality are all elevated from a basic sweatshirt. I’ve worn it 10+ times and washed it all without any problems. The fabric is soft, pleasant to touch, and a little finer feeing than typical sweatshirt material. I am 6’0” 165 lbs and typically wear a medium if I want to be relaxed and comfortable. This medium fits that bill. I consider it just a bit loose for my preference at my current weight, but it still looks trim enough and should remain a comfortable fit with some winter weight (commonly flex to 185 in winter). I would consider this a medium weight fabric (though I could see how some would call it lightweight.) It’s fairly thin for sweatshirt material, but warm and cozy - not at all thick or heavy feeling. Should work broadly on cool spring and fall days as well as mild winter days or as a winter layer.2 little gripes: 1 - this color was called “light heather gray.” Other customer images and the model pictures seem to show that color, but my sweatshirt is much more medium gray/gunmetal. I wasn’t thrilled about it at first, but my “fashion experts” tell me it’s a better color than the lighter gray, so I’m good — but it seems there could be an inconsistency with this color. 2. I have a tiny quality control issue I’ve yet to report. There’s a metal cap on the drawstring, but only one end has it. It’s nice looking, but I’m not worried about having it or not... just need to find out if I can take the one cap off without damaging the plastic binding. Or if they could send a replacement cap I guess? Seems silly though - I just want to make the 2 ends match.Giving 5 stars because my concerns are minor compared to the quality and value.

This product isn't perfect, but I am ordering 3 more since I like them.  Below I have listed the GOOD/BAD/UGLY.The GOOD:The material is very nice.  The tag says it is made in Vietnam. 56% cotton, 44% polyester.  Machine wash warm with like colors. Tumble dry low. The material feels very soft and comfortable.  I like the wide selection of colors/styles.  The hoodie I received looks exactly like the one pictured (black/white striped).  The zipper on the X-large measures 25 inches from top to bottom.  I'm a tall guy, and the height is just right.The BAD:The size chart does not match the product.  Looking at the size chart, I ordered the ""X-Large"". According to the size chart, an X-Large should be the following dimensions:Neck: 17-17.5""Sleeve length: 36.5""-37""Chest:  44-47""Waist:  38-41"".However, the X-Large actually measured the following:Neck:  21"". (3+ inches larger than advertised). However, this is a hoodie; it doesnt really matter what your neck size is.Sleeve: Approximately 36"" from center of garment to sleeve. (same as advertised).Chest:  50"" (25"" across bust). (3+ inches larger than advertised).Waist:  48"" (24"" across waist/pockets)  (7+ inches larger than advertised).Not only does the product run larger than advertised, the material is a little stretchy too and can stretch to fit someone larger.The UGLY:The hood itself is huge.  I have a big head, and this hoodie makes my head look like an infant's head.  I can literally put a basketball comfortably in the hood with room to spare.  Not only is it big, it is a deep hoodie.  Maybe I can fit 1.5 basketballs in it.Now that I know I need to go down a size to a Large, I am ordering 3 more hoodies since I do like this product.  For the price, comfort, and styles offered, these hoodies are a good buy.  Just make sure you get the right size!  Giving this purchase 4 stars - deducting 1 star for posting an incorrect size chart.",Don't use the size chart - these hoodies run BIG.

I prefer a bit larger so I have the option of more hood over the forehead, also more hood adds weight which seems to help with preventing the hood from turning and sticking with your head turns, resulting in a half-covered face that needs a hood readjustment.My one qualm that prevents a 5 star is the shedding, after one wash it still sheds on my pants/shirt. When those are lighter color, the fur covering me is like I have a blue short hair pet. Perhaps after more washes these will go away.All in all, I'd probably get another, if it stops shedding, I'd definitely get another.","Good fit, good feel, but good golly that peel",Size: SmallColor: BlueVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,25,27,3418707,Public

These really should be listed as slim fit if they're not already. There's no ""give"" in the elastic, either- the elastic has a row of stitching at the top, in both the waist and the sleeves, that ensures it doesn't stretch much. The fabric itself isn't very stretchy, either. I guess that's nice for helping the hoodie keep its shape, but it adds nothing to the comfort department. Also, there's a rough tag at the neck, and rough inside seams. I have sensory issues and I was looking for sensory friendly clothing that doesn't feel tight, rough, or restrict movement. And this isn't it, unfortunately.Also note that if you have a long torso, these will be short on you. Possibly even if you don't have a long torso. I'm only 5'4"" and an XL sits above my butt, which I've never actually had happen before, and is kind of surprising.I'm probably going to have to return this, which is a huge bummer, because I really wanted to like this hoodie.","Good quality but runs small, and isn't sensory friendly",Size: X-LargeColor: BlueVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,28,39,2465443,Public

I bought this zip sweatshirt so he can adjust his comfort accordingly.  When I first saw the size of the package, I was surprised at how small it was given I’d ordered a size 2X. The size of the package was commensurate with the medium thickness/weight of the fabric.  I usually order an XLT for him but since that wasn’t a size offered, I opted for the 2X.  He is 6’3”, 240 lbs, has long arms, carries his weight in his tummy and has a small “bottom.”  The overall length, the sleeve length and the fit around his chest and tummy are fine. Because of his small backside, the back of the sweatshirt does hang just a little bit. I don’t think that’s a bad thing.  Just know if the person you’re buying for is built like him, it won’t be form-fitting around the lower part.

But according to the label, it's actually 40% cotton and 60% poly. Still acceptable, but not at all what I chose & what I was expecting.Other than that, it's quite nice. I was fretted over what size to get, since everyone says they run larger than normal. And it is perhaps a smidge oversized, but the fit is still pretty much what I hoped for. I'm 6'1"", 185, and the fit is roomy and comfy but I'm not swimming in it. The only bit that's maybe a little too oversized is the cuffs on the sleeves: very large diameter, and I imagine once they stretch out a bit they'll be drooping over my hands.So overall not a bad jacket, but be aware that if you're hoping for 100% cotton, chances are that's not really what you're going to be getting.","The Blue Space-dye is NOT 100% Cotton, but still a decent hoodie",Size: X-LargeColor: Navy Space-dyeVerified Purchase,,282,101,320019,Public

I can get this on and wear it but it's a tight short fit.  I'd compare this to a woman's 2 XL.
