Been buying them for my 8 yr old son for years. But Crocs sizing is annoying! If your child grows out of a pair, ONLY get one size bigger. Two sizes bigger will be huge!! In my first 4 pics, I showed the difference between his last pair (size 11-12c) & his new pair (size 1). The new- size 1 pair is much wider & roomier! Which makes them difficult to stay on. I wish crocs' strap was adjustable, so it'd help to keep new & bigger pairs on a child's foot! They stayed on my sons feet through the summer, but barely! They'll fit better this summer.The last 2 pics are a comparison of these 'classic crocs' & the 'crocs coast clog', both size 1. The crocs coast clogs have 'crocs' written on the top near the ankle. They're more narrow than the classic crocs. BUT, they're slightly longer. So be careful of that. I found the classic crocs to fit my son better. The strap on them held his foot on better.So if you're planning on getting your child a pair, get their current size. These are so big. Or if your child grew out of a pair & you want to get bigger ones, wait till they absolutely can't fit in them anymore & only go one size up!",Perfect kid shoe!

He wears sneakers to school and otherwise Crocs.  I was surprised when he told me how long the Crocs had lasted before he wore through the bottom of them.  Nothing lasts that long with kids.  His old shoes were a size 2 and we wanted a size 3 now.  I was confused by the sizing because ""Big Kids"" starts at a 4 and I assume that he is a ""Big Kid"".  The sizes in order of the pull-down menu are: ""Little Kid 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11,12, Big Kid 4, 5, 6"".  But that is not the correct size order.  I think the correct size order should be: ""Little Kid 6, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, Big Kid 4, 5, 6"".  So, a ""Little Kid"" 3 is larger than a ""Little Kid"" 12.  After thinking they didn't have his size, I finally figured this out and bought the ""Little Kid"" 3.  The shoes fit and are even a bit large.  We are happy, but hope to help others who might be confused.  What is called ""Little Kid"" 1, 2, and 3 are really ""Big Kid"" sizes - that is, they are larger than ""Little Kid"" 12.",Confusing Sizing - But Can't Beat the Durability of Crocs,Special Size: Little Kid (4-8 Years)Size: 3 Little KidColor: Slate GreyVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,10,15,26232346,Public
