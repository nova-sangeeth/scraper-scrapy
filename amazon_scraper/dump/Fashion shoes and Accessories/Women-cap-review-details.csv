The one that I ordered was Shipped and Sold by NYFASHION101 so I thought that I would get the quality that it had previously known for. The beanie looked great on a person with a normal size head. I have a smaller head than an average person and this run small. In fact, it's so small and that slouchy look would suit a baby, toddler or a middle schooler.

You can adjust it to be a little slouchy, or roll it up to be more fitted. It's very warm & chunky (as stated). I've been wearing it during our Florida winter cold snap to cover up my thinning pixie style hair (due to chemo). Those who have lost all of their hair to chemo may want to put on a thin liner cap underneath it. It's soft, but it does produce a lot of heat which may make an already sensitive scalp itchy. It may not be a factor for those who live in colder climates.I still love it as a head covering. I receive compliments every time I wear it. I love that I can stretch it over my ears as well. I haven't noticed any pinching around the ears. It' actually very comfortable. I'd definitely recommend this style beanie (and the oversized slouchy beanies) for any one who is losing their hair to chemo. It would be a great gift.

I went to Amazon to replace my fav CC hat (which was purchased at a small store). Both hats I ordered were fulfilled by Amazon but from two different sellers/prices. Neither hat compares to the CC hat I previously purchased at the small store, that hat was fantastic. Both hats have the ""CC"" logo on the outside, however the confetti hat appears to be a knock-off. The confetti hat is smaller, and isn't as well made, for example the inside of the top of the hat has loose threads and no inside label. The ""CC"" tag on the outside doesn't have the circled ""R"" by the logo. It was also less expensive than the red hat. The red hat fits great, has a CC tag inside, and the outside CC tag is softer with the circled ""R"" included.  The Confetti style hat isn't a bad hat, for the cheap price, but compared to the red one it's clearly less quality. The small size it kinda annoying so I'm deciding if I want to keep it or not. Bottom line is, as other reviewers state, it's a gamble ordering these hats from the various sellers marketing them on Amazon- some are great and the real deal, but a buyer just might get a less quality knock off. For the price it's might be worth the gamble, as many can be returned as well.

I looked at reviews and saw all the positives about them being bigger, slouchy hats and thought, “ok this is what I want”. I ordered two and they just arrived today. (1-15-20). They seem to be made with decent material but the problem is, they are SO SMALL. I’m sorry, I have the tiniest, roundest, head EVER. I am famously known in my family and friends for having an unusually small round teeny tiny head. Mostly due to a jaw malformation I have had since birth. Usually, when I buy standard hats, (even ball caps) they are always so huge on me. And I have never bought a beanie/slouchy hat before, these were my first ones. I WANTED it to be bigger and slouchy. That was the point!!! So I read the reviews and looked at pictures of other Buyers and felt that I was going to get a big slouchy hat....NOW, I see that I was ripped off or received a product that was not as advertised. These hats have NO SLOUCH and they are so small. SO SMALL. For someone who has a normal sized head, these will NOT be beanies or slouchy hats. They will be small bowls sitting on top of their heads. I feel bad for all the people buying these hats thinking that they are going to fit their standard sized heads. Since they are so small on my tiny head, I can’t even imagine what they would look like on a normal head. I’m thinking the reviews I read were all old reviews from years ago when this hat was actually made right or made from a different company. But today, 1-15-2020, I received hats that were not as advertised or previously reviewed. So disappointed!!! I’m not even certain my 7 year old niece would get much of a slouch out of these hats!  With all that said, the hats are still cute for being standard winter hats. They are soft and stitched well as far as I can see. But there is absolutely no consistency on where these are made. Some in China, some in Honduras...looking at all the reviews, I see that we are all getting different products made from different places and to me, that indicates SCAM SCAM SCAM.  Shame on amazon for not filtering their suppliers a little better! If you want slouchy or saggy beanies/hats, go somewhere else because you will not get that from these hats. I will still use them, but my hunt for the perfect slouchy hat is still on. :/","Buyer beware, these hats are TINY!!!!",Color: 2 Tone Black/Dark BeigeVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,48,30,1478999,Public

I like simple styles and colors, and this is perfect in that regard as well.

Also, the violet one was definitely tighter than the other two.As for the colors, they are not as they appear in the photos.

It was already on my wishlist so I'm not complaining. New Lavender is a medium purplish pink, it actually is a sort of mauvey color anyway.

The cap fit snugly on my average to small head but not too tight. The material is soft (100% acrylic) but my skin is a little sensitive so I would readjust it when it starts to feel scratchy on my ears. I just moved to Washington from So Cal so I was not quite prepared for their winter weather. These keep me toasty. I'd recommend checking out the company's website to have an idea of how they look.

I wasn't expecting to find my new favorite winter hat! The material is thicker than I expected- not super soft, but I actually prefer it that way as I have fine hair that makes hats tend to slip off my head if they don't have a little texture to them. It's certainly not itchy or uncomfortable, however.I also have a hard time finding hats that don't feel like they're vice gripping my head (not sure if I have larger than average head or what), but this one fits comfortably with just a little bit of slouch to give it some style. Love that it comes in so many colors...I may just have to order some more!",Cute and surprisingly functional!,Color: GrayVerified Purchase,,64,11,4857252,Public
