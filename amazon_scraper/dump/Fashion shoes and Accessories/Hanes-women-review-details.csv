With that caveat, not bad. They are thinner than expected, but still can be used in 45 degree morning walks without another layer, as long as you keep moving.  The legs were long enough, and the very large was just about the right size for larger hips.  But this purchase made me realize WHY some many sweatpants include drawstrings:  a good fit at the hips may or may not insure a good fit at the waist.  Also, this is another example of what extra large doesn't mean:  the length between the crotch and the top of the waist needs to be longer than it is currently.  If I wanted that much definition of my groin area, I'd wear skinny jeans, not sweats.  They are not as bad as some I've seen, but still, sweats are designed to be loose, not fitted.

I did that. But I didn’t notice reviews saying if you have a butt don’t order these. I put them on and wondered if I had them on backwards because they seemed slightly baggy in the front and very tight and hard to pull up in the back. When I sit down they stretch tighter across my butt making them pull down and the top of the pants sit just barely above my butt crack. This is not what I’m looking for in a comfy pant. It seems they’ve been cut straight down and that the cut of the front and the back are exactly the same. So imagine flipping your pants around and your butt, which sticks out a bit on most people, has very little room and then your front, which doesn’t stick out on most people, has some extra cloth as thought the manufacturers of these pants expect you to have a front butt. The length is great (I’m tall with long legs and they come down to my feet, but not too long). They’re pretty soft. But the cut is so weird it clings to the sides of my hips to show off  all the stuff I never wanted to see and is tight on my butt do shows off all the underwear lines I don’t want to show and sags in the front. Since I got them for $7.50 on super-sale I’ll keep them as back up sleep pants but they’re not good. I don’t like them. Why 2 stars and not 1?

As you sit throughout the day, the material stretches out and I have to roll it at the waist to keep from sagging down. These are long on me as well but me being short, it was already expected.

Still a great price and hopefully these pants will shrink with washing.**Update**I bought three pairs of these pants in the grayish color, ebony, and purple. The purple one was way more stretched out and over sized than the others after the first wear. The gray and ebony fit similarly with some stretch. However, after the first wear the ebony pair had a whole in the leg within just a few hours after putting them on.

I’d recommend for cool weather tho as they are sweatpants but not super heavy. Washed them in cold water and didn’t notice any shrinkage.

If they last only one season I’ll still be a happy camper!I am 5’5” 185#.  Purchased Size Large - I was worried buying clothes online but needed casual warm lounge pants and the sale price was great. Plus it’s Amazon with no hassle returns. I wear a size 16 average and got the large (12/14) as recommended even tho the size chart indicated XL. The pants are medium weight (great for cool weather) and the large fits perfectly. Inseam hangs maybe 2 inches below ankle but doesn’t drag on floor.  I didn’t measure but I’d guess inseam at 29/30 in. I carry most of my weight in hips and legs and often have problems with the legs fitting too tight. These fit good, not tight and not baggy. Waist is a little low for my liking as I prefer high rise and these fit more at mid rise range. I love the wide waistband too. Makes for a smoother fit. Haven’t washed them yet so may shrink but I’m thinking if they do they will stretch back out. Have no idea how they will hold up over time thus 4 stars instead of 5, but for the price you really can’t go wrong. I recommend.

Not sure if truly petite ladies ought to buy these though. If 5’6 132 lbs is a small, I know it wouldn’t have fit back in olden days when I was a size 2-4. One last thing, sizing-wise: I’m completely pear-shaped; if you’re more apple-shaped, then your normal size might be fine. And it’s no big deal returning things on Amazon (and, dude...you know...$7.50).If the second pair doesn’t work out, I’ll amend my review, but as long as you get the sizing right, hell yeah, I’d recommend these.",Great!

Most said the pants were larger than normal so order down a size. Others said they fit just right. Most said they were too long. So I ended up ordering one pair of the L size and one pair of XL. I figured my husband could have the XL depending on how they turned out. I tried on the L pair, haven't washed them yet, and they fit perfectly except for the length. I did end up with a regular fit as petite sizes never showed up for me when ordering, so I expected them to be long, but not as long as they are. I'm 5'4"" and they go down about six inches past my ankles, so I have a feeling petite would have been too long also. Otherwise, the waist is perfect and the fit is fine. They're nice and soft and very warm-feeling. Since they're just to wear around the house I'll roll up the legs and they'll be okay. My husband can have the extra-large, they should fit him just about right. I've worn his 'hand-me-down' sweats over the years, normally size XL, and they've been fine on me if a little baggy. These Hanes pants seem to be men's sizes rather than women's, but with a stretch waist instead of a draw string. Maybe the manufacturer made a mistake somewhere along the line. It's interesting that the L was made in Jordan and is 60/40 cotton/polyester, while the XL was made in El Salvador and is 50/50 cotton/polyester.

I am a yoga teacher and have plenty of yoga leggings, but sometimes I want something a bit more loose-fitting without looking sloppy.  These pants were perfect for what I wanted!

Second, the fit is different.  The waist fits oddly, cutting across my belly in the front and dipping low in the back; this is NOT comfortable.

It's a flat, very wide strip of elastic, and it's not sewed inside the cloth. It's right out there, exposed, and rather rough, and if you wear it next to your skin, it can be uncomfortable. I'm about 5'4.5"", 120--125 pounds, and this is medium size.The length is ok, not long enough to drag. The pants hit the top of my feet, but not by much. This seems the right size for me. The waistband is not too tight on me, but it keeps pulling the pants upward, so the rise often feels too short. I think the waist is poorly designed. Elastic should be narrow and covered by cloth, and this elastic is probably much too wide. That seems to cause the problem with pulling upward. But you might have different results.I don't like the open bottom, but just thought I'd try it. A stretchy cuff feels a lot neater. I'm going back to men's sweatpants with a waist cord that you can adjust, or internal elastic waist, and stretchy cuff at the bottom. Probably won't return these, since it's a hassle. The material is moderately soft and warm, so I'll just use them.I have slightly wide hips, but within normal range, and that may be the problem with the waistband.

Nearly everyone said the sweats run large but to play it safe I ordered both sizes. The mediums fit but are snug enough in the waist to fit like yoga pants. The larges are way too big. The larges fit more like an extra large.
