I was sick of buying 2032 battery’s and being not sure if I bought junk or something good. I had bought some cheaper ones and they had all since expired so it was time to buy more. I figured I would do the usual and read some reviews, weigh in the 4+5 stars to see what present they took up, weigh in the price, and read reviews. So I found what I felt were the top 3 rated and purchased them.Because my son and I are avid remote control car races I have a fairly high end charger that I can trick into discharging these small batteries. Even on the lowest setting it discharges a little high. The low setting was .1 amp discharge. But I used it all the same and looked to see how long they would discharge before the reached a cut off voltage of 1.8v. Plus I recorded starting volts of each battery and end rebounded volts after disconnecting them in a same timely fashion for each. GloFX seem to be the champion by far. Note I only tested 1 of each. It’s on my dime so I only tested 1. See the pictures with the results to make your own conclusions. Have a great day",So I tested 3 different brands... see my results,Size: 6 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase,339 people found this helpful,,,341271,

There's a drug store very near me that I buy lots of different things from.

They want $19 for 6 batteries, or $7 for just one, and I got all 6 for just over $5. How this store can get away with such overpriced items is beyond me. Maybe they're circling the drain of bankruptcy and overriding everything in some desperate attempt to stay afloat I don't know. But what I do know is that id NEVER buy batteries from them. Another big box retailer that rhymes with FallWart is also insanely overpriced. They buy for far less than what I paid here on Amazon yet want 1000% markup profit plus some. From here on out, whenever possible, I'll be buying everything I can online and staying far away from the cultures that call themselves retailers. They are robbing us blind and this is but one example. I love these batteties and this size typically works in everything i need a cell of this type in.
