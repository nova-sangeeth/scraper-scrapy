They feel like velvet, and are unique in that they will keep me warm in chillier months but are airy and breathable enough to wear during the sticky, humid summer months.

These are almost perfect.I will note two small issues with the pants, however. I only bought light colors and they are all semi-see through. The seller has noted (when answering questions on this product listing) that they are not see through so I feel like this is disingenuous of them, because you can absolutely see my underwear through the pants--even white underwear. However, this is not a big issue for me because I plan to wear these pants just to yoga and out for basic errands, where I just don't care very much. I do feel like it's worth nothing through because the seller made a point of the opaqueness of the pants and it's just not true for the light colors. Also, seafoam is depicted in the picture as a cream, off-white color but in person it is more gray and blue, which was not what I was looking for. It's not a big deal and I like the pants enough to order another pair in standard white but again, worth noting.

I don't like my clothing skin tight so I sized up to a 1X. The pants look exactly like they do on the model. I carry all my weight in my butt and thighs and it was more form fitting in both those areas. The rise of these pants is very high on me (well last my belly button) so I will probably end up rolling the waistband down. While the pants are super duper soft they are also very unforgiving of cellulite and imperfections. Any kind of bulge or dent will be seen, especially with lighter colors. The same can be said for the leggings that are also made by this company. I'm not sure if I will wear these out and about but I will definately wear them to lounge around in.

I took it under a light that gives a little more of an orange-y yellow hue so it cancels the purple a little, but it just doesn’t look that pink, it’s too dark.

It’s probably a hassle to return them so I won’t bother because they’re at least soft.Another bit you’d want to know is that the smooth material tends to cling in the butt, so I got panty lines wearing these.

The fabric is super soft,and comfy, like cotton meet... velvet; smooth2. When you think of legging you think skin tight,  not the case with these. They fit just right (around my thighs).3. The length is ideal, and falls just below the ankle, without touching the floor.My con about this item is that as expected, it is too large in the hips. It is too spacious from the seam to the waist. I ended up rolling up the waist. It fit perfect that way. But I don't want to have to roll the waist.I ordered a 2nd pair, an XL in hopes that it would still fit in the leg, but also properly fit in the front, eliminating the space in the crotch.  I will compare both fits and return which ever one doesn't fit my preference.Verdict: after trying the XL, my final decision is to keep (and purchase 2 more) in the XL.",Soft and Comfy,Color: NavySize: 1XVerified Purchase,14 people found this helpful,39,31,2897827,Public

I ordered the black joggers with an orange camouflage zipper and then the black joggers with army camouflage zipper. The same size feels vastly different. The latter is of thinner material that feels softer but is probably a little more prone to wear. The orange zipper one felt like a large (or medium) to me. It’s not tight but it’s definitely more fitted.I’m 5’6 and fairly ‘athletic’ curvy. I have wide hips and thighs and a butt so I wanted these to be loose fitting without compromising style and length.The pro is that I really love them both. The army camouflage zipper joggers, I’m less likely to wear out in public because they’re so thin that I’m a little wary of them but for lounging at home they’re perfect and comfortable and feel lovely. They’re high waisted so for my purpose it feels flattering.I’m just frustrated that they haven’t had the XL in stock for either style in months.

On the plus side, the fabric is the same inside and outside the pants, which makes them very pleasant to wear. The synthetic polyester fabric also retains your body heat, which is nice in the fall, winter, and early spring when it's chilly because they'll still keep your legs warm. They're also surprisingly opaque for how thin they are, which means they are actually okay to wear outside the house so long as they arent too tight in the bum. The construction is adequate - nothing special, but no holes, but there were a few loose clusters of threads that had to be trimmed. As for the downsides... they're extremely thin and clingy, so though they are plenty opaque, make sure you're wearing appropriate underwear because the outline will be visible. The pattern, probably not, but the shape will be. The polyester fabric also means that they don't breathe as well as cotton or other natural fiber materials, meaning they can get very warm in the summer or if you're a warm sleeper. I also find that the drawstrings are pretty short, and I've had to rescue them from being swallowed by the casing a couple times, but the elastic is robust enough that the pants stay up fine without it. Overall, great warm-ish pants for inside or out, if you have lowish standards for what pants you wear in public like I do.","Cheap and synthetic, but still pretty nice",Color: BurgundySize: X-LargeVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,87,48,1462337,Public

These are a little on the thinner side, but so soft! So they may show panty lines, but that's an easy fix, don't wear any! If that is important to you, I would size up for a looser look to avoid the lines. Or get your usually size in a dark color and a go up a size in the light colors. I will probably by the rest in a Medium. I saw some reviews saying these are baggy in the crouch, they are NOT. They are meant to be worn high waisted, over your hips and rest on your belly button. If you wear them down past your hips, of course they will be baggy. My one tiny super small complaint is the pockets, they are too small to be functional and b/c of the soft fabric you can see the outline of them in the pants, which is one of those small pet peeves of mine.

I think they look sharp enough that they don't look silly with a nicer knit or woven shirt and cardigan if I have to be on an unexpected video call (not that my pants matter as much). I am 9 months pregnant now and still wearing these, I just sized up a few sizes. My pre-pregnancy measurements were 31"" waist, 41"" hips, and 2 months ago I was measuring 36"" waist, 41.5"" hips (I bet I have grown in the belly since then!). I can pull them up over my belly (which is very cute <sarcasm/> but it's nice to have the option) or wear them below and the elastic will keep them up (much better than some much more expensive ASOS maternity sweats I have and never wear because they refuse to stay up). They are intended to be high waisted, so they sag in the crotch by about 4-5 inches when I wear them under my belly, but whatever.They wash decently, they have a little bit of wear on them after just a couple months of weekly wear and washing, but you have to look close to see it. They haven't shrunk that I can tell, and I dry them in the dryer.I have thick thighs and a big booty in and out of pregnancy, so my one caveat is that I recommend getting a dark color. My undies show through some in the yellow color (I have the bright yellow, the dark gray with rainbow stripe, and the deep forest green). They're also not real forgiving in the department of concealing lumps and bumps in any color; if your drawers are too tight, you'll be able to see it for sure if you have a bigger booty and these aren't sagging on you. They don't show cellulite on my upper thighs though, which is nice. Overall, I'm happy with them and they're working for my purposes.

I love the pockets, I love the shape, I love that they show my booty but are still comfy sweats you can lounge around in, they're perfect and I get a lot of compliments on them.

I like the way the large fits better but the XL works on me. Maybe they're supposed to be more snug, and I like them a little on the loose side because they are not leggings, they are joggers and I want them to feel like loungewear, I don't know. I am a yoga teacher and kind of figured these would be my yin pants (slow, long hold stretching yoga.) However, I have actually taught a couple of power classes (fast paced lots of moving about) in these pants and they worked great, weren't falling off or coming out of place any more than a high quality legging like lululemon. Not to mention, I have had several people assume that they are lululemon and ask what they are called so they can go buy them from lululemon. uh, WOW, what a deal!Women's sizes are awful; its so confusing when you wear an XS in some cases and an XL in others. Which is why I value reviews that state a women's typical size, her height and weight, and what size she purchased/how she felt about the way it fit. Pictures also help of course. So if these are ever available at the same great price again, I will be buying them in every single color lol.

I bought the medium size and they are a bit lose around the waist. I don’t mind but if you want a tighter fit go a size down. Also, I am short and the bottoms are super long on me. I’m used to pants being long on me but when I put them on, they completely cover my feet so, something else to consider.

While hand washing (for a total of about 15-20 minutes) the joggers bled this dark purple pigment. My hands didn’t get stained and neither did my bathtub. But they did bleed a lot of color. After washing I kept rinsing and wringing the joggers until the purple faded to this really light grey color. Then my hands got tired to I wrung them using a towel (orange) and it didn’t stain so that’s good. Overall, really cute and comfy!","Comfy, cute & worth it",Verified Purchase,,,,62593673,
