For the sake of the review I felt it was important to clarify that I am a woman.I purchased two packs of these in different colors. First, it's important to note that these are not all the same material. One pack I received was polyester and the other was cotton. I thought I was receiving polyester per the description. I just went back to check the listing to make sure I didn't miss anything and apparently I did. If you select a different style/color, the description of the underwear does NOT change until you ALSO select a size. This was an oversight on my part but was also a bit misleading. I like to be pretty active and I'm not a fan of how cotton underwear tends to stretch and get baggy throughout the day so I returned the cotton ones. The polyester ones are a cheaper itchier material than what I am used to. Especially for the brand. Not bad. Just OK. The size was also smaller than I expected. I usually wear an XL and have even lost 10lbs recently but these are a bit tight. Still wearable but if I were to order again, I would definitely go up a size without fear of them being too big.

Second is the cotton crotch isn't affixed in the front and sometimes rolls but isn't a deal breaker for me.

Cotton is lovely except that I like slippery fabric that allows pants to slide on and off easily.  I've returned these, exchanging them for another color in the hopes that a silky fabric arrives the next time. Since my original set bought at Sam's Club sometime back came in standard panty sizes (5-7 or 8) I can't comment on fit.  The first set are my all time favorite panty, fitting perfectly, covering butt and crotch with a sleek stretchy fit no matter what contortion I'm stretched into so I'll keep trying.Update: I loved these Warner hipsters after my first purchase at Sam's Club. After my first Amazon order came in cotton instead of the nylon I ordered, the exchange was done quickly and correctly.  The sizing is accurate although next time I will return to ordering a size up as I do most of my panties in order to get comfortable coverage.My details, for comparison:  I am 5'4"", 105 pounds, most of my pants are 4.  I prefer a tailored but not overly tight fit in general.  When sizes are listed as 5, 6, & 7, the charts tell me I am size 5 but I buy 6 to avoid crotch cutting and skin overflowing elastic.  These are listed as S, M & L with S showing it fitting sizes 4-6.  I decided to try S to see how it worked.The fit: First I held up the new S against a pair of the older size 6.  The crotch width is virtually identical.  The width from side to side differs by about 2"" which makes these a traditional size 5.  The new ones fit fine with no muffin top, as promised, although leaning over allows some skin bulge.  I live in jeans so this is not critical.The fabric: These body of the new ones is 90% polyester & 10% elastane; the older set is 81% nylon & 19% elastane.  The new ones are thinner.  While I prefer the richer feel of the older set, there is nothing wrong with these and I'll keep them.In the future: I will look for a different fabric in search of the original & order a M to size up but these are exactly as described and fit appropriately.",Update after receiving correct fabric,Size: SmallColor: Black/Pale Pink/Dark Gray HeatherVerified Purchase,,14,12,6504092,Public
