Nobody has complained yet so maybe it's like when you try to open the door quietly and think the ""creek"" sounds like a shrieking hawk all of a sudden.

If the same complaint is mentioned over and over in different reviews, it doesn't really stop me from purchasing. It just helps me make adjustments in my purchase (if that makes sense?).So saying: Do yourself a favor and read multiple critical reviews before buying.  Had I taken the time to read the reviews before I clicked on BUY on these slippers, I'd have bought one size larger than my usual.My review:PROs:* The inside sole is very, very cushy.* The bottom sole is the same as my slip-on tennies.  It's a firm, hard, rubber-type material with excellent traction; making it far less likely for you to slip on slick flooring or a wet spot on the floor.I wouldn't recommend tromping through mud or going on a hike while wearing them but, you could easily wear them to pop into the store for some late night snacks (I might have done this once or twice. Maybe.).* The material the slipper itself is made of is thick and soft; making me believe the slippers will last a good while (if you don't wear them to pop into the store EVERY night).* The material that covers the outside of the slipper has tiny ridges and looks like it would repel liquid if you spilled something on them though I haven't tested this theory.* The colors--inside and out--are bright. I chose the neon green/black and the colors are very pretty.  Although the neon green looks more neon yellow-ish than green, to me.CON:  I've only found one CON but I'll explain in as much detail as I can here; in hopes that it helps you decide what size to buy.*  The size is not a true fit.  I wear a size 12 women's which translates to a size 10 men's.Size 12 in women's shoes is difficult to find so I have most always just bought men's shoes when it comes to slippers, flip flops or boat shoes.  Size 9 or 10 in men's has ALWAYS fit well, if not just a tad loose when I buy a size 10.So I thought (assumed...) these slippers in size 9 - 10 would be just right.  Wrong!  These slippers fit more like a men's size 8 1/2 or, at most, a men's size 9.First few times wearing them I had to force my toes up into the top of the slipper.  Which, was SO not comfortable but the slippers stayed on even though they felt a big snug.I've now had these slippers for a few weeks and they still aren't as comfortable for my toes as I would like.I find myself taking them off a lot, merely to wiggle my little piggies around.  I am sure the slippers will stretch out and be perfectly comfortable with a bit more wearing.  But, I also suspect I'll wear out the cloth of the slipper covering my toes faster than normal.So saying:  These are very nice slippers but if you wear a 9 1/2 or a solid 10 in men's?  You would do better ordering a size larger (rather than the 9 - 10 here).Here's hoping my review has helped you buy the most comfortable slippers for you!",WARNING: Size is not accurate!,Size: 9-10Color: Black/LimeVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful

Thousands of people bought them and rated them above four stars.  They're not kidding.  These slippers are great!First off, they're Memory Foam and your feet immediately feel the difference once you wear them when new.  The cushioning is better and softer than even expensive outdoor sneakers with air, gel, or Memory Foam inside.  The entire bottom is made of Memory Foam, not just Foam for the toes, arch, or the heel, so you get full foot support.  The thick layered comfort lasts for months.The top fabric is thick and strong; it wraps nicely around the feet, and adds a degree of warmth (especially in the winter) unrivaled by many other half-open slipper brands.  The dark colors prevent stains and dirt from discoloring the fabric.The rubber soles have grooves although I wouldn't say they're for grip for hiking on trails.  The soles work best on carpet and do not leave behind black scuff marks or deposit dirt.  I don't wear these slippers outside; I only wear them indoors.  Do note that wiping the black rubber soles will leave behind black color on the paper towel so I don't advise wearing these slippers on wet surfaces.  But the soles can indeed be wiped clean on the occasion you do step outside.Eventually, the top fabric covering will lose its tightness and expand to the point that it's no longer warm and the Memory Foam will get flatter. These occurrences will probably happen before the rubber soles wear out so that's when it might be time to replace the slippers.One disadvantage of these slippers is that when walking on tile or hardwood flooring, they tend to clop like a horse trotting down a cobblestone street.  This clopping noise can wake people up at night when going to the bathroom or kitchen.  These aren't silent slippers on hard surfaces because the black soles are made of hard rubber.  But inside a house with carpet, these Memory Foam Slippers are excellent for everyday use.",I can see why that this is an Amazon Best Seller Item,Size: 7-8Color: Blue/MaizeVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

This isn't an issue at all for me, I wasn't really planning to wear them with socks, but KEEP IN MIND TO MEASURE YOUR FEET WHILE WEARING SOCKS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO WEAR THESE WITH SOCKS!  Will save you the hassle of ending up with a pair that are just a bit too snug.Now, the reason I was looking for slippers in the first place was because I have two ferrets, one of whom will bite any socked feet he sees within seconds, so I've either had to go barefoot or put a pair of Crocs over my socks while in my bedroom to avoid getting my feet chomped on!  This pair looked very thick and sturdy and seemed like they could stand up to the occasional chomp from a playful ferret.

First, it was really confusing when reading the sizes to determine what to get since I normally wear 10.5 Wide shoes. The company had suggested to someone in the questions section to get a size up to allow for wide feet, and so that is what I did. I immediately wound up returning that pair because they were oversized.Trying to give the benefit of the doubt since it was very easy to trade that pair back ( which is why I gave two stars instead of one) I decided for another smaller-sized pair. After a week or so now of wearing them for less than 5 minutes at a time only inside the house a few times a day, I have to say this is the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn. They are completely flat, have no arch support and are really loose around the sides.

I don't know how long it will hold up before losing its support, but right now the cushioning is very nice. The material that is on the outside of the slipper, however, is a lint magnet.

Wearing them around the house for a few hours, however, they are again covered in dust, lint, and threads. I have no idea where it's coming from since most of our floors are either ceramic or wood and are cleaned regularly, but these slippers collect a lot of lint.Next is the sole material.

I have but one vote among the 20k+ and average 4.5 stars.  However... I'm leaving this note for anyone that might read it.I bought these slippers on a lightning deal in February.  They were 4-5 stars for the first week. I really liked them.  However, over the next few weeks, they flattened out just like any cheap pair of slippers do.  Finally, less than 2 months later, one of the slippers split up the side, so I contacted their customer service.It took 3 emails to them over 2 weeks before they answered, and only when I mentioned that I would reflect my experience so far in a seller/product review.At first, they told me to ""go through Amazon for all after-sale inquiries"" which is incorrect, since Amazon only handles returns within their standard window.  When I referenced the part of the product description that says ""...24/7 US-based support team ready to take care of all your after-sale needs..."" They were quick to say that they evaluated my situation and were denying me any support.  Their wording was spiteful which was very much unappreciated.  A pair of slippers with 20k+ reviews should last more than 2 months.I liked the slippers at first... but they wore out quickly and finally split open... then the RockDove customer service had absolutely no remorse or support for their own product.  Apparently 20k other people have not had the same issue that I did.  Or, they left positive feedback within the first week of wearing their slippers, which is far more likely.If you buy these slippers... keep track of your return window from Amazon, and check them over for any rips/tears in time to return them.  Otherwise, you will be throwing them away because you'll get no support from their customer support team.","Comfortable for 1 week, split after 2 months, apathetic customer service would not replace them",Size: 10.5Color: Dark Gray/BlueVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Because of the memory foam, when you first slide your foot into them they might feel snug and comfortable but even within your first use of them the foam will compress and your foot will no longer stay in them easily and they will feel two or three sizes too large. I would recommend sizing down.However, there are much more critical issues.The interior cloth becomes pretty irredeemably stained and they look permanently dirty after a few months simply from dust/skin accumulation. Repeated washings and light stain removers haven't done anything to resolve this and I would be hesitant to use anything stronger given the rubber soles and the intense colors.  I tended to only wear these in the mornings after sliding out of bed and to/from the shower: it's not like I was coming back from romping in mud. I got the black/green colorway, but given that all the interior colors are light I believe its a fair assumption that it applies to all colors.The foam becomes very much ""un-foamy"" after only a short time. After a few months of daily use, the foam really does have a memory and just becomes thin padding between your foot and the sole/upper. They are still relatively comfortable, but not due to the foam and certainly nowhere near as comfortable as the first time you slip them on.And lastly: the flaw that prompted me to write this and toss them in the trash. Those would all be relatively forgivable and just chalked up to wear. But after just under a year the lip of the sole started to crack. It was only on one side and not under my foot so I wasn't too concerned. I mostly assumed I just wore them in weirdly. But today I was cleaning and noticing this crumbly black dirt all over my floors and it kept reappearing no matter how frequently I swept it up. I eventually realized it was the sole of the slippers. Barely over a year of use and the sole of one of the slippers has completely cracked and broken to the point that it's now crumbling and disintegrating.These could be fantastic slippers if they behaved the way they did when you slip them on. But sadly they are not and you'd be better off with a pair that's half the price that will probably last just as long.","Great out of the box, downhill fast",Size: 11-12Color: Black/LimeVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

It's not terrible, but I do have to be mindful when walking in them to keep them on my feet... but I guess that's why they call them slippers right!?!  I don't know, I think they could have a little taller rear or tighter top band to hold your foot better.

Because of the ""half foot"" style, all this will cause them to fall off your feet very easily, even just normally walking around the house.On the bright side, they are high quality; after a year of wearing them constantly, they are still in excellent condition. If you like this style of slipper, & order them 1 size smaller, you will probably like these slippers a lot, which is why I give them 5 stars even though I don't personally like them.

But I tried two sizes, based on reading other reviews and Q&A here, for my standard-size-12 feet, and neither works. I started with the 13-14 and they were just too loose; they felt like they were falling off as I walked. So I went to the 11-12, and they aren't as loose - but they are still a bit loose - but more important, they aren't long enough. The back edge of the upper is more under my heel than behind it, which makes walking uncomfortable. It's worse if I put socks on. The ""best"" case is if I take off my socks and cram my toes into the front - then the heel isn't so bad, but the toes are crammed (and the mid-section is still too loose).I've seen comments from the seller about the sizes being based on standard shoe sizes, but that doesn't matter - without a real heel, there's nothing holding it snugly on the foot. So then they should adjust the width / upper to hold better - and they haven't. These just aren't designed to be walked in comfortably, regardless of what size they claim to be.I don't really want to return these again, and with COVID shipping delays, getting a better pair seems like a challenge, so I plan to keep these.

Given that information, I am not sure why memory foam is used in shoes at all. I have high arches so the support in these slippers falling so quickly is a real disappointment.

Oddly the sizing for Deer Foam ended up being larger than expected which I don't typically come across with a size 13.

I have decided on keeping the ROCKDOVE slippers and returning the Deer Foams as there is a significant difference in how hot the Deer Foam's get while wearing and I'm currently in one of those months that are tolerable in AZ and know I would be miserable trying to wear them year round :-p.I gave the ROCKDOVE slippers 4 stars ONLY because the back isn't tall enough to stay on the heel. If they came with some kind of elastic strap or some way to have it go over the back of the heel to keep it from slipping forward and falling off that would be 5 stars as a perfect product.ROCKDOVE was great and advised me of another model that has a higher back but not in two tone and it would be too hot for my location.

However, after about 3 months I experienced the same problem as other reviewers.  The stitching and the soles are still OK, but the memory foam broke down.  As a result they become, in effect, a larger size which causes them to come off your feet at inopportune times.  Worst case scenario this instability can be a trip hazard however, mostly it’s frustrating to continually retrieve a slipper that has come off from backward or sideways movement.  I must emphasize that I had this problem only after the memory foam no longer held the slipper on my feet.  I’m not sure what the intended service life of these slippers is and they may be OK for light minimum use but they didn’t work for me.

I ordered size 13's of this slipper since no 13.5 was available and it's definitely still on the larger, loosely fitting side. The length isn't far from being right even though there's still a bit of a gap between the back of the shoe's heel and my own, but the width is definitely too wide and something I would expect from ordering a shoe size advertised as ""wide"", creating a lot of horizontal wiggle when walking that occasionally requires a curl of the toes to the shoes from sliding off. If you have wide feet, these may be perfect for you, but I'd recommend most people to buy a size 1.5 smaller than they think they need.","The ideal pair of light slippers, but make sure to order a size 1.5 smaller than you need",Size: 13-14Color: Dark Gray/BlueVerified Purchase,

I needed to call an exterminator, and I needed to get some comfortable foot protection or I would never feel relaxed. Sure, I could wake up every day, lace up my Docs, and tromp around thoughtlessly smushing the little buggers until bed time, but that sounded like a hassle.The reviews on these seemed pretty solid, so I pulled the trigger. And called the exterminator.Couldn’t be happier. They’re super comfortable, fit right, and let me shuffle around the house without worry of surprise wasp stings.They’re kinda stylish too. Went with the grey/blue combo and am happy to report I haven’t gotten any funny looks when answering the door. They almost look like slip on walking shoes. Sketchers for staying in. The exterminator didn’t even notice I wasn’t wearing standard kicks.They are pretty warm, which is a bonus right now (mid-February), but might be an issue when the sun comes back.They seem solid enough to wear outside for things like checking the mail, but I haven’t tested that theory yet since I’d like to keep these clean and spiffy. Also they may protect from stepping on a wasp stinger, but I don’t think I’d tangle with a snake or bobcat while wearing these. Probably not suited for yard work either, but one can dream.A note on fit: I’ve seen some complaints here about sizing being too small. The slippers came with a note about breaking them in. When I first put them on they did feel pretty snug. Heel was in danger of falling out the back. I wore them for a couple days and everything relaxed. I’ve had them for a few weeks now and they’re amazing. Not too loose, and not too snug. I forget I have them on while conked out in the recliner. Love em.",Super comfy. And wasp proof.

A couple weeks later after the newness wore out the foam had crushed on the inside of the slipper and they tended to easily slide off my feet but they still keep my feet warm during the winter months so that was okay. Now I am 4 months into ownership of them and as you can see on one of these slippers it is split on both the inside and outside of the sole on the right slipper. I know these aren't the most expensive slippers out there but I certainly expected them to last more than 4 months.

These slippers are by far the best of any I’ve ever tried. Living in MN slippers are not only an absolute must but something you buy sometimes 2 times a winter due to the far below 0° temperatures we have for 2-3 months straight. My husband and I are addicted. I have purchased 4 pair so far. Never disappointed. We have a pair to wear in the house at all times and a we use our old pair to wear outside to get mail or whatever and slide back into our new clean pair when we come back in. I won’t lie and say both of us have accidentally wore our slippers to the store more than once because they are just kind of attached at all times lol. They also are very honest and correct with sizing. I thought the first pair was to small but I listed to the email they sent warning me of this and give it a couple days. With in 2-3 days they fit like the coziest socks you could imagine. I just bout 2 new pair and am actually considering an additional 2 just to keep at the end of the bed for those moments you forget wear you took them off. 2 thumbs up and highly recommend.,Nothing better in my experience.,Size: 9-10Color: Black/LimeVerified Purchase,
