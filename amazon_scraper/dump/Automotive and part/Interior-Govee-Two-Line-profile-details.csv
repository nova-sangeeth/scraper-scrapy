Obviously I started doing some research on which model to buy since there are so many to choose from. And if you're still doing your research and you came across this review, let me make it easy on you. But this!First of all, the price point is excellent. Second of all, it's an RGB led strip with Bluetooth connectivity that can play in tandem with the music you're playing in your car. 3rd of all the installation is as easy as plugging the power plug into the cigarette socket in your car!Okay to be fair, the installation took me longer than expected: around 45 minutes total. But to be fair, I spent the majority of that time to figure out how to best install the strips and to hide the wiring so that it's not going to be all over the place.I purchased a cigarette lighter socket splitter (www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SF63PP7) so I can plug the led strip into one socket and still have another functional socket for whatever.After figuring out how I wanted to install these lights, I ran the strips and the wires through the center console of the car (where the socket is), down under the front seats, to the sides and tucked the wires under the plastic cover by the floor of the door, to the front.I made sure to clean all surfaces with alcohol before sticking the strips and control on it to make sure that the adhesion will be strong.Once all that was done, all I had to do was download the app, created an account, and connect the led strips to the app via Bluetooth and now I have a party car!All I can say is I'm super happy with this product. And for only about 15 minutes (unless you're like me) and a little over $20, I think you should definitely take the time to install this in your car as well!!","It's a Party in Your Car!

In general the product is nice looking, well built, materials seem to be decent including the labeled 3M tape (I question authenticity) . The LED brightness is on par with other LED products in this price range. Overall it is an average LED RGB lighting product. I cannot tell you about the Bluetooth function or app, as I never did make it that far. My experience with this product stopped at the installation! Why did I stop there? I have the double side series 4 light kit. The biggest issue is how these lights are wired, even with two lights per wire, they are wired in series making installation extremely difficult if you like the wired to be hidden and no bundles of wire stuff or crammed into one spot. I originally wanted to do locations under the dashboard and under the front seats of my F150.  That being said, if you want to feed the wires through and under dashboard or console parts you cannot do that, as the wires do not disconnect which means you would have to fish the entire LED system through LED lights, controller and power point. So hiding your wires is impossible! Next, having the lights in series on one side each means you are running double wire on your furthest LED light. The controller is nice, it is a mate black plastic housing with three buttons power, color and music mode. The power plug is big, but does have a switch on the back of the plug for turning off and on. The included hardware ie., screws are useless for vehicle installation, you would be lucky to ever get them into any type of plastic to secure your lights. The 3M tape is generic looking tape with white background, there is no trademark on the tape I suspect it is fake 3M tape even the 3M logo is halfway cut off which is not how 3M tape comes, with the included screws and the tape, my opinion is that the screws are useless inside a car, the tape will not last long in the summer or hot areas of the south and mid-west. As with any inferior tape product for inside the car the heat will loosen these light pods and in time they will fall off. With all that said, I cannot recommend this product for vehicle use. There may be a more useful application for this product with some modification such as on a boat, in a house, or the bed of a truck. If you do not mind wires all over the place and a sub par installation, you could get this product to work. I think overall you will be dissatisfied with the installation, the fake 3M tape will not last long and you will find yourself heading to the auto parts store for real 3M tape. Overall - do not buy, you get less then what you are paying for, this is import junk cheap product and you will only end up replacing it, or never installing it like me.","If you expect to do a professional installation, and do not mind fake materials!",Verified Purchase,45 people found this helpful

They have started sending constant notifications advertising games and JUNK and have made it so there is no way to turn it off.

Quality is top notch, I've used many other LED light strips for non-car related things and these are much higher quality than others I've used. The only thing I wish it had was a bit more length in wire from the base to the first set, and a tad more between the first and second set. I have a small car and it had some trouble reaching.as for the app, it's nice to use but it's not required at all. Using the controller is very easy to use.

I recommend everyone to purchase this product. It’s amazing for a inexpensive price to pimp out your ride, lol.... Check out my dramatics in the video of excitement when I finished installing it and observed the effects. It only took me about 25 minutes to install it. I watched a YouTube video of a person installing a similar product in their vehicle to get the idea how to install it in mine. The bright LED lighting, music and talk features of the lights reacting to sound is hottttt.... I love the mobile app that allows you access to more control features such as creating your own lighting features and changing the special effects. I love the fact how I have the ability to present a light show of my vehicle interior with the vehicle on and off because it’s plugged into the cigarette lighter that powers the source. I recommend everyone to purchase this affordable product. Btw if your contemplating between purchasing this product or the newer version that is $20 more, in my honest opinion, I would suggest you stick with this product that is cheaper. After my own research of doing a cross analyst of the products features, it’s basically the same exact functions. So why pay more where you will have the same effect of the this product version at a lower price. Also, when purchasing the product make sure you do a test run to see that’s its working properly prior to installation, that way you don’t waste time. I read some reviews that had that as an issue. You can create your own club scene in your vehicle with great music and your hot LED lighting show. I love how I didn’t have to use any screws or zip ties to properly hold the lighting strips in place. The adhesive tape that is attached to the lighting strips is effective enough. I was able to successfully hide the wires by stuffing them under the vehicle panels along the sides of the vehicle. My minor issue is that I wished when I started the setup that I would have ran the wires differently from what it was displayed on this site advertisement such as running the wires alongside the gear shifts on both the drive and passenger sides towards the rear. This would have prevented a piece of the wire being shown in the front of the vehicle which isn’t that noticeable, unless your zooming it. Other than that, I am totally satisfied with this product and happy that I was able to totally do it myself without any assistance. Check out my video upload, I must warn you I was really dramatic and excited with the results of the product as it’s shown and shouting out my Bestfriend.

I fell for the fancy holographic packaging. The kit was flimsy. The light strips crumbled after 9 months. The adhesive came loose and the plugs absolutely sucked and constantly came disconnected from the strips. Out of constant frustration over tinkering with them I just ripped them out and threw them away.I really missed having lights in my car and was extremely apprehensive of this brand I've never heard of and the price it was offered for. After reading the reviews and remembering Amazon's return policy I figured what the heck and ordered it.These things are in a class of their own. They are bright, the adhesive is SUPER strong (and it comes with tiny screws if you'd rather do that) and the app connects quickly and is quick and easy to use. The strips themselves are stronger and more durable than the TypeS ones I originally had and the LEDs are enclosed entirely. The best part: all of the strips are permanently connected. No more frustrations with loose connections! The wires were more than long enough to reach my backseat as well! I would recommend using velcro in the back if your seats aren't plastic underneath. I hard-wired these directly into my fuse box using one of the ""add a fuse"" kits sold on Amazon to hide the cables and mounted the control switch directly under the dash by my steering wheel. The switch is easy to reach, but hidden as well. I use the app for all preference setting, but can still reach down and turn them off quickly if I need to. The ONLY thing I miss about the TypeS versus these is the ability to independently control the colors per strip (have blue under driver side, pink under passenger, etc). Other than that, it is super cool having such a wide variety of color schemes, the ""create your own"" scenes, brightness adjustment and their reactions to music playing is on point and responsive. Installation took less than 30 minutes and thats only because i didn't properly secure the ground wire and it took me 10 minutes to figure that out.

I think the colors could have been of better quality. The orange is more like a yellow gold. The green looks yucky.2 - loud bass throws off the beat of the lights when you place it in “song mode” where the lights chance and flash to the song.

I had to use zip ties through the rubber ends and one around the middle of the light bar to attach it.

They are really bright and they work really good it goes exactly to the beat of the music it’s actually really phenomenal at the price point the only reason I give these a four star instead of a 5 is because it’s a pain in the butt to install depending on your vehicle if your car has carpeting all throughout the lower part of it where the lights go it really doesn’t mix the adhesive does not stick to any plastic or carpet only metal actually the airbag Storage compartment underneath the driver side – what is metal so the adhesive stuck to it the rest of them had to be screwed in to the carpet and to get the tiny little screws through the Hole in the light it’s really a pain in tight spaces but overall it’s pretty easy to install if you know what you’re doing. Also I’m not sure what to do with the one that is sticking to the metal because the adhesive is starting to come off and you can’t really screw through metal in there is no carpet in the area so might have to figure out something but overall it is very nice and the adhesive is still holding on that one so when you do get this I suggest screwing it in if you have an option. Also make sure to hide the wires inside the panels as well as you can they just left right into the corners of the plastic on the side of my car door very easily so that was really convenient but sometimes they tend to pop out every now and then and when you get in the car you forget about it and you go to press the gas and you pull the wire with your foot then you yank the light off of the top then you have to reinstall but I tried to watch for it as much as I can different cars are different set up so they might be better in those web for Chrysler vehicles or Dodge or jeep or anything like that Mopar I know for sure that that will happen overall I do suggest that this is a very good product and I would invest in it for the price point.!,Amazing but could be a bit improved and use patients when installing.,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

Legit. These lights are so great! I just got a new car (legit just a box) for college, so I wanted to spice it up with something (also, quarantine, i'm bored out of my mind). Ended up getting these lights, cutting the cigarette lighter off, hardwiring it to the fusebox, and it turned out perfectly.I had no idea you could adjust the brightness with the app. But still, I was more than happy with the turnout. The lights were bright, but not SUPER bright like some reviews had. I came back to write a review and I saw that some people were complaining that they were too bright, and that's when I realized YOU CAN USE THE APP TO ADJUST IT. My mind is blown. I turned the brightness all the way up this morning, and you definitely can appreciate the lights during the daytime.The app is super easy to install. Create an account, pick the device, and that's it. You can pick ANY color from the colorwheel they give you, you can set your own modes, choose custom colors and custom speeds, you can have it cycle or blink or whatever. For example, I have mine set to 3 colors that I picked out on a slow gradual cycle.My car only had one cigarette lighter, and I needed that for the phone, which is why I had to hardwire mine. I would expect that if you have any newer car, you probably could spare a cigarette lighter for these babies. The cords are pretty easy to slip under the trim parts of your car,ALSO, did I mention that they provide zip ties AND screws for you already.ALSO, regarding the 3M tape, I didn't get a chance to try the 3M tape on the lights (I found the zipties easier), but I did use the 3M tape on the back of the control panel thing, and it stuck super well (although it's only been one day). In fact, I had to reposition it, so I stuck it twice and it's still on there. I was expecting to use gorilla glue anyway, so if the adhesion of the tape is your holdup, it's REALLY not a big deal.MUSIC MODE. you can change the sensitivity on the app. I didn't try it, because the sensitivity was fine when I brought it out of the box.

I have one strip on each side pointing at the floor and one strip running up the bottom sides of the dashboard, illuminating the rest of the floor, the sides of the doors, and some of the seat edge.They are nice and bright for what they are. The colors are pleasant, and while you can switch colors manually with the little control box, I installed the app to connect to them and change it to a rainbow effect that alternates with music. Once set, though, it seems to keep the setting even when the truck is turned off, so it's not like you need to keep the app on your phone if you're not going to use it. I'm not sure if changing out the battery of the truck will set it back to default or not, though. I'll find out when I change the battery later on.So far, the adhesion is working fine.

You can download an app to your phone and personalize all the different colors, patterns.... turn them on remotely and other stuff. it's crazy i love it!!! they also work great with music because they pulse with the beat!!Couple things.... it uses the 12V outlet... and in my car it's in the center console armrest so i had to get creative where to place the control panel for the lights. Also i didn't think about where i was going to attach the lights so that was quite a process to plan out where they were all going to go, but was definitely worth the challenge.  There are only 2 places where you can see the cord (coming out of the armrest.... and on the front passenger side floor,  because it wasn't quite long enough for me to tuck under the side panels for where i needed to install the lights), otherwise it looks like they were installed in the car.

I had to use the included zip ties for the back seats since it was only fabric, no metal or hard plastic for adhesive to sick to. Zip ties worked great.

Reading these reviews, I had hoped this would be possible given this affordable set of LEDs. It seems that would be possible - but not without having to manually reset the color/program when these turn on and not without a three-color cycle upon the lights powering up.If you turn the lights off and then on again via the app or the ""control box"" while power is being provided to the lights (ie, while the car is running), they will turn back on to the same color they were displaying when you turned them off. They do have a certain degree of a ""memory"" function.BUT - if you interrupt power to them via the switch on the cigarette lighter, or by turning off the car, they ""forget"" the color you had chosen and default to a sound-sensitive red light at medium brightness. Furher, they cycle through Red, Blue and Green upon powering up before defaulting to that default red color.I wanted to put this info out there for fellow DIY-ers and shade tree mechanics.

If you typically have different passengers, you can quickly switch the lights from a multi-color fade to a static color without fumbling through your phone app. The screw holes are an excellent idea because the adhesive on these types of lights always fails over time. I feel like they should have made the screw holes hard plastic rather than rubber though. The rubber easily gets damaged.",Great lights with many bonus options,Verified Purchase,

I actually flipped the lights facing the bottom of the seats to tone it down. You can adjust the brightness easily on the controller or app but I'd rather not accidentally blind myself.

Routed this t tap to a cigarrete lighter under the center console and through a hole I created inside of the center console. I routed the led lights through the same hole and under the carpet to ensure no visible wires. This kit even came with a little flashlight. The app is way better than imagined.

I do understand the fact of causing a distraction to you and other drives but would like the option to brighten the lights a bit more when the car is stationed and with friends and family listening to music.

The lights have no problems turning on and they are decently bright.

I had to zip tie the lights against the car / make holes and make holes into the back seats so I can properly secure them. If your just relying on the tape holding the lights it will not work and when you zip tie it make sure its super tight so it does not hang when the tape falls off. I know nothing about cars but I was still able to manage. Computer nerd <=. You will need a drill for the lights though.

I was concerned they would be too bright and thus distracting as driving, but really it's not because the ideal place is under the seat areas. It doesn't seem to strobe multiple colors, just one at a time. Not sure why there would be two on/off buttons. Seems redundant, but whatever.

They make my car look so cool and I always got compliments on them as soon as someone would enter my car. I have a 2017 Altima with a reverse camera and unfortunately having these lights plugged in caused my back up camera to go blank. I took it to the dealership and they told me that often times they see that LED strips cause a shortage and you’re only left to go without them if you want your electrics back to working condition. Luckily after a week of unplugging these lights from my cigarette lighter, my reverse camera has regained its full function. Besides this, these lights really are nice and super easy to install.
