Yesterday when I was getting my oil changed I mentioned to my service rep that the 12 volt outlet stopped working while I was using the vacume but I already changed the fuse and it still didn't work. He did some digging around and replaced a different fuse that neither of us thought to change for a while and it started working like a charm again. Bottom line, awesome customer service but do be aware that these devices can and might just blow a fuse in your car. If you don't know what that means it might sound scary and discourage you but it's as common as the common cold. It's an easy $1-$3 fix and if you take your car to the dealership or an auto zone they'll do it for you might even do it for free.",Stopped working after about 3 or 4 uses.

I was expecting it to be the size of a lot of the cordless household ones, but this is much smaller.  Because it is small, the attachment hose and other attachments it came with clog easily with things like dry pine needles. You can shake them out, even while the vacuum is running because the suction is non-existent.  More on that suction issue in a bit.It is also made out of cheap plastic.  You would want to treat this like it is glass because it would probably break if you were to set it down roughly, or set something on it on accident.  The plastic is thin and just garbage.  It's just absolute garbage, not made out of quality anything.I missed the fact that this was also corded.  Not a deal breaker, just wasn't expecting that.  I would have been willing to hassle with the cord if it worked.This vacuum's suction power is non-existent.  It is a gutless wonder.  It does not want to suck anything up (including dirt), even with my car is running.  They advertise that this vacuum will work better with your car running, so I started off using this with my car running.  If that is the best it has, it is terrible!!One possible contributing factor in the lack of suction (besides a small motor and the poor quality materials used to manufacture this thing) is how it is designed.  It is designed with a plastic flapping ""door"" near the mouth of the vacuum where you suck up stuff which probably accounts for some of the lack of suction power.  The vacuum has to suck the door open in order to suck anything up!!!  I do not understand that design at all, as it probably greatly reduces the sucking power, which would explain the lack of suction.  Heck, it was not even able to suck open the door!! I had to shake the vacuum around in order for the flapping door to move, hoping there would be a brief suction.  Yeah...terrible!!!I know that my car is dusty with dirt.  It has not been vacuumed in a long time. But the vacuum was pretty much clean after using this vacuum.  Very little dirt residue was inside the vacuum because the suction is just that bad.  The air filter?  Hardly dirty at all from my trial vacuuming my car out.  There are no words.  Really.  This vacuum does not work. Period.I will be returning it for a refund.

With all of the positive reviews for the ThisWorx TWC-01 corded Car Vacuum It seemed like a simple choice for a small 12v vacuum to keep in the car for quick cleanups. I realize it is a small 12v appliance but was hoping for much more than the suction this one was providing. The cord seems to heat up a bit too much when using for more than a minute or so. Suction is nearly non-existent. It does pick up loose light items but there is no power behind it at all. I have used older home cordless vacuums (nicad) that had much more power than this corded model that I received is providing. I specifically sought out a corded model to try to get a more powerful unit than what most cordless models can provide. I do like the longer cord along with the hose attachments which makes reaching some areas fairly easy, and the carry bag that keeps it compact, easy to stow away and ready to go. Not sure if I possibly received a defective item & I will have to try another outlet and/or vehicle to see if there may be a power issue in my car before adding this to the pile items of that would have been nice to have if it would have worked as intended. I will update my review if I discover there was another problem not with the product itself that was contributing to the diminished function.*****edited 4-1-2020- I have to say that the seller/company has been one of the best I have encountered. They reached out to me and were willing to go out of their way to satisfy their customer. Although the first product I received did not meet my expectations (which may be too high for such a product) they offered to send me a replacement so I am willing to give the product another try. I have been a little busy since receiving it but will update my review when I can try it out.*****edited 4-29-2020- I have since updated my rating to 5 stars. The company is still willing to go out of their way to satisfy their customer.I have now had the opportunity to test the vacuum on another known good 12v socket. While it does not perform as well as a 115v unit, or a much more powerfully designed 12v or more vacuum can (meaning much larger & bulky = very much less convenient) it does however perform much better and as well as a mini 12v vacuum can. The outlet on my other car must not provide adequate power for this type of use and/or length of cord so I cannot fault the vacuum itself.I do love the filter design making it very easy to empty and clean. The extension hose and fittings, and the extra long cord makes this unit easy and ideal for using in the car. It is powerful enough to clean the inside of the car if you are not in a huge rush (which is one of my bad habits/faults) s.I would recommend this unit if you are specifically looking for a corded option so as not to have to deal with batteries that do not last or especially can never take the type of heat they would be subjected to in the southern US no matter what anyone claims.",ThisWorx for TWC-01 Car Vacuum - corded,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,64 people found this helpful

The length of the cord is great and allowed me to reach most of my Ford Explorer from one end to the other without having to plug into the rear power outlet. BUT the suction of this vacuum leaves a LOT to be desired. It does the job for relatively light touch-up cleaning. But if you have to pick up anything larger than grains of sand--like pretzel bits left by your kids (or you), you may find yourself picking them up faster with your fingers.I also found that it had a hard time easily dislodging stuff from carpeted areas without MULTIPLE back-and-forth attempts. The clear dirt reservoir looks like it will hold a lot, but the suction power decreases rapidly as dirt collects in it, so I found myself emptying the cup way too frequently, as well as cleaning the tiny filter. (You will need to clean the filter several times during use to keep the suction decent.) It's easy to do, but the frequency I had to do it was annoying.  Small threads and fibers caught in carpeted areas also are not easily vacuumed up. This thing just doesn't have enough power.Although it comes with lots of accessories, every time I would attach something, it would reduce the suction by 30%.

Well I Hadn’t bought a car vac in 20 years cause the ones that actually plugged in the lighter never seemed strong enough to get the job done. So... now I know why I stayed away from these. Ok ... it looks sleek and stylish but other than being a art piece as a car vac it doesn’t suck (literally). It’s fine for getting fine sand/dirt particles and the occasional straw wrapper that falls between the seats. But if you want the “just detailed” look... it’s not here. I’ll stick to my trusty house vac with long hose attachment to get everything out of the carpet and floor boards. I guess it will be fine for some that wants the portability and doesn’t mind it missing the things in the fibers of the carpet. I haven’t tried many but I really don’t think the market has one powerful enough (still after all these years) and that plugs into lighter that has the juice to do the best job that I’m wanting.

As I was vacuuming, I had to remind myself that this plugs into a 12 volt cigarette lighter port and that a regular vacuum has about ten times more wattage.

I did have to work diligently with it, but it did a very good job on my car and it's much easier than dragging out my bigger vac and the 100ft extension cord I have to use. The power is much better if you turn on your vehicle, but keep in mind that if you're going to do that and vacuum in a garage, make sure you have plenty of ventilation.The attachments are great; I love the brush, and the clear crevice tool worked better than the one on my bigger vac. The cord on the vacuum is solid, not flimsy at all, and is a good length. I have a subcompact car and had no problem going from the front of my car all the way into the trunk. Also, it is designed so that once the dirt goes in, it can't come back out, which I think is a great feature. The on-off button does seem a tad cheap, but for this price point, it's still a very good vacuum. The manual is super easy to read and understand and the company that makes this vacuum (Orythia Inc.) definitely gives the impression that they have integrity and are customer service minded, so overall, I'm happy with this purchase.","Overall, Very Satisfied",Color: BlackVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

I just got a new car with black interior, so as you might imagine, I can see every little speck of dirt etc.  Using this car vacuum, every speck quickly is taken care of.  The cord is long enough to reach every part of my SUV, and the attachments are all useful for different areas of the car interior and floorboards. The filter is easy to remove and is replaceable with the free filter provided. There’s also a little brush included to help dust any debris getting caught in the filter. You may also wash it by hand. The suction power of the vacuum is pretty strong and with the attachments, it makes the job even easier. I use the brush attachment to get my seats and areas with cat hair, and the hose type attachment for little cracks in the doors, console and between/under the seats. Using the vacuum without an attachment works well for my rubber floor mats as well as other areas. Finally, this vacuum, all the attachments, extra filter, filter brush and super long cord all fits neatly into the zippered canvas case. As a whole, this vacuum is something I love so much that I’ll be ordering a few more to give as Christmas gifts this year.",I love it!!,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,10 people found this helpful

The vac came when promised and the post follow up customer service has been a nice added extra mile from the company. I'd certainly buy from them again. As far as this vac, here are my thoughts...First, you can only use this vac while the car is running so that is a big thumbs down for me. What if I want to clean my car in the middle of the evening in my garage, running the car is not an option. So I guess the maker of this product assumes busy moms will just pull the car over immediately after a spill, whip out the vac to clean up the mess and then carry on down the road singing kum ba ya to their destination...not gonna happen. Also the hose is make of extremely cheap material. It worked but felt flimsy. Also, I wish there were additional pieces included that could get into tighter spaces, between the seat and the console, places like that. Last, the suction is just OK. would be nice to have another setting for higher suction.

So far, it's not a bad little vacuum. I wouldn't expect it to do any major heavy cleaning that a proper shop-vac could do, but for a weekly general cleaning, it's perfect. The suction is great for the size and power limitations and it feels sturdy in the hand. The motor used sounds very healthy, properly sized and adequate for the job. I recommend emptying the container after each use and dusting the element filter out to keep suction strong.PROS:* Portable (Small enough that I literally leave it in my car at all times.)* Super long power cord (I didn't even remove the tie wrap. This thing could be used on the largest of trucks.)* Multiple useful attachments (Although I do wish they had a narrow suction attachment for real hard to reach places.)* Suction power (For the size, the power is great. Comparable to a well-charged modern Dustbuster.)* Overall mechanical quality (The vacuum sounds smooth and mechanically well built. Not like the other vacuums I've tried that sounded like nuts and bolts in a blender. I would assume this thing has a well constructed brushed DC motor.)CONS:* Cheap plastic chemical smell (Although the build quality is sturdy, the plastic smells cheap)* Accessory quality (The clear extension tube is made of a polycarbonate type of plastic which can crack easily if you're not careful.)* Portable carrying bag just a tad too small (While I wouldn't consider this a con myself, I find that the carrying bag is just a tad too small to fit everything comfortably.)Overall, 4 out of 5 stars.

It comes with a short hose, a brush, crevice tool and extra filter.  It also has a nice loooooong cord - unless you drive a limo, the cord will likely reach from your dash to your trunk.It isn’t a powerful vacuum - I have a dog and it sucked up most of the dog hair but it doesn’t compare to one of those industrial vacuums you’ll find at a car wash.  It will pick up cracker crumbs from sloppy passengers but you won’t detail your car with it.  I ran it for a few minutes (7-10 minutes...) and it never got hot - it was a cool day (~50* f), so that may have helped but the point is that you can run it for a while without worrying about burning it out.I didn’t buy it as an inflator, however some folks use their shop vacs for this purpose - this machine will not do that without modification.  For me, this isn’t and issue - I bought it to clean crumbs off my floorboards (comment provided for review - I don’t know that anyone would buy this as an inflator but someone may ask...).I like the little storage bag and the apparent customer service (I hope not to need to repair/ replace this during warranty) - there’s a lot of documentation on and in the box to tell you how to address any customer concerns you have with their product - this is a nice touch.Ultimately, I received what I paid for (a $20 car vac to spot clean my car between trips to the car wash....).

Its hard to knock this vacuum at the $30 price point.I bought this vac for my mom for Christmas. Its job is to clean up after her 11 year old child who doesn't seem to understand (or care) that my mom would like to her new car looking clean outside and inside. So we are looking to clean up the cookie crumbs, potato chip crumbs, grass and dirt she tracks in everyday while being dropped off and picked up at school.Pros-----Suction: Suction is ""good enough"" for messy little kids or responsible adults. Its not like the house vac or going to the vacuum at the local car wash. Sometimes I have to pass over that piece of grass three times before it will pick up. It will pick up crumbs, dried up grass, and dried soil.Filter: The extra filter is cool.Clean Up: Very easy,  just push the top button, pull off the cover, pull out the filter and tap in on the ground a few times. I also took a fork and cleaned in between the paper folds.Price: Its $30Cons------Suction: If I were to use this for irresponsible adults who leave like a quarter piece of cake, or a bit piece of hamburger, then no this vac would not get the job done, I would have to take the car to the car wash or get the house vac.Sound: Its a little loud!Cord Length: If the cord were just 1 foot longer, I could vacuum the center of the trunk, as it os, I can only get the sides.The Bag: My BIGGEST complaint is the orange and black carry bag, it too small to carry the bag AND the accessories. I'd rather just not have a bag and store it in the box it was sold in. And then make the box a little bigger because I'm not going to be able to pack it as well as the manufacturer packed it. Also, the bag is kinda cheap looking and feel, it kinda takes away from an otherwise good unit.Summary: Its a good maintenance vac for a car that's not too dirty.

I have children, whom often express their talent of putting more crumbs on their seats than in their mouth, and my goal was to have a way of quickly cleaning the mess. With that being said, this vacuum does an excellent job at doing that. As far as removing dirt that is deep within the carpet, this vacuum simply doesn't have dyson-level suction. However, because of the quick-clean ability, there is a much higher chance of avoiding the dirt that gets deep within the carpet.I have a 12V plug in the front of my car and the back but the extra long cord was one of my primary reasons for buying this.

I am not the best about reading directions for a seemingly common-sense product so I might have missed that important direction if I just plugged it in and turned the car key without turning on the engine.  So make sure you start your engine when you use the vacuum in order to have full suction power.I have a messy 2-year-old that snacks in the car on a daily basis so when I got a new vehicle and he smashed Goldfish crackers into the floor mats, I knew I had to buy a dedicated car vac.  I have literally only used this once but I'm super happy with it.  The attachments are so well thought out and the suction power is GREAT!  I used to lug my Dyson outside to vacuum my car and this little thing honestly does a better job and is a million times easier to use.  The only downside, which they CLEARLY warn you about it in the directions, it how hot the plug gets when you use the vacuum for even just a few minutes.  I put it under my arm for a second while wearing a tank top and I jumped when it hit my skin because it was so hot.

Attachments are usefully functional. READ THE BOX and READ INSTRUCTIONS. It will work pretty good without your engine running but the suction power is dramatically increased with the engine running. This is the perfect vacuum for the “new car buyer” intending to “keep this one cleaner”.I DIDN’T want a full size battery type hand held vacuum for double duty in the house. I tried that.

It also didn't pick up as much as this one did. It worked great on picking up all the small stones and dirt that was on the floor of the car because of our gravel driveway. I am though still figuring out how to get the fuse in the plug Incase if that ever needs replacing. I also like the fact that everything fits in the bag that came with the vacuum. I'll be using again this spring to clean out the car and put it to the real test of a full clean of the car. Even though I should have gotten the model with the light but I got my phone so I can just use that. Now like other people have reported if the vacuum does not work before saying the vacuum doesn't work check for a blown fuse in your car. Try other devices in the AC Port. It can happen on basically anything plugged into the port. If yours is like mine I think it had a little yellow 15 fuse they're pretty cheap to buy being less than a $1 for one a pair of needle nose pliers can get it out unless you have a fuse puller. But check that first if the vacuum doesn't work it might have popped the fuse which isn't a big deal it's a simple fix,Pretty great for the price I would recommend,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,

We live in Minnesota where it is inevitable that the winter enters your car all season long. Sand, salt, snow. There is no point in vacuuming your car on a regular basis when there is wet sand and salt always on the floor. So most of us wait until spring time. Usually I get my car detailed in the spring, but because of COVID-19 I have been unable to, and our car washes and gas station vacuums have been shut down as well, so I looked on Amazon and got this one. I am pretty happy with the results. Not as clean as it normally would be bringing it somewhere, but it leaves our cars very presentable.  I highly recommend this product. Cord is really long, the attachments are good quality. It comes with an extra filter. Really light weight as well.

The other thing is the cord, though it reaches the back, gets caught or snags on things a lot.

Though I'm not sure if this is the one they got, I figured this was perfect due to the already great reviews received, and boy was I right.  Once I took it out of the box I was in business.  I love how the vacuum was able to suck up the debris left behind from going in and out of my vehicle.  I also love the ease of use and the attachments that come with it to handle the tight spaces in between the seating of the vehicle.  The cleanup is easy with just one click the debris is disposed in the trash.  There are two filters that come with the vacuum, which is also nice.  One thing I would say I dislike is the construction of the filter and how removal of debris is difficult with the tight pleating (not sure if this is the correct word, but it will do) at the base and the top of the filter.  Though the vacuum comes equipped with a small brush it does helps somewhat with the removal of debris in the aforementioned areas.  One would need something like a toothpick or something smaller to completely dislodge what is stuck.  My only other gripe is the carry bag not being big enough to hold the two filters in it.  Minus the issue I have with the filter and the size of the bag, this is a great product whether you live in a house or an apartment , and don't have a long enough extension cord to vacuum out your car with the house vacuum, or don't want to go to a gas station or car wash establishment that has vacuums with hoses that have been damaged overtime and attachments are worn to the point it can possibly scratch your seating (if you have leather) as result of contact.

I recently got my car back after a bad accident and it was filthy inside and this really helped to clean it up. The brush does a phenomenal job at getting grass and dirt out of carpet.My only gripes with the vacuum are that it’s not super powerful and the door to keep all the dirt from falling out doesn’t really shut. I found a lot of times when brushing that the vacuum didn’t have enough power to pick little twigs up or even leaves (even when they were small enough to fit into the hose). There were frequent times where I would have to pick things up and toss them out because the vacuum couldn’t pick them up.  It seems like the attachments do a better job then the vacuum itself does. It’s most likely a defect on my model but the little door that’s keeps things from falling back out never shut, even after and cleaning and when the vacuum was off.All said it’s good for it’s price. You get a vacuum with a 12v plug so you don’t have to worry about extension cords and can clean where you are.

I sometimes feel like people steer you away from buying a great product, as if they don’t want anyone else to have it as well lol.My review:The vacuum came perfectly packaged! It was inside a box with bubble wrap and inside of another box that was wrapped in plastic. It was protected from any damages that could have occurred during shipment. The suction is GREAT for a 12v. The cord is EXTREMELY long. I don’t let my car get too dirty so it works VERY well with getting up my small messes. It also came with a nice scented air freshener! I love everything about it! From the packaging to the accessories and the warranty. Thanks!",AMAZING Vacuum! Worth the money for sure!,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,

It did work in my Nissan, but the suction is very weak. Very disappointing. I asked to return, but Amazon says I must take it to an UPS Store to do so. The nearest one is 37 miles away from me.

While this little vacuum isn’t perfect, it does the job just about as well as the big vacuums at the local car washes. It would be nice if it had a little more suction, but it does the job adequately. The cord is really long, and you can easily plug it into any outlet in your car and vacuum anywhere inside unless you happen to drive some giant stretched limo. The little hose and nozzle attachment is really good for getting into tight spots and it seems to work the best for sand. Overall, this is a good little vacuum for your car. It is a little loud, though, and the plug and cord will get a little hot.",Nice little vacuum,Color: BlackVerified Purchase,
