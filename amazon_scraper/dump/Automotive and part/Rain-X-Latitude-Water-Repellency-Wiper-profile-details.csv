I have purchased probably 8 sets of blades for my Honda Odyssey  and every single ""beam style"" blade I have purchased has missed the edges of the window (Where it curves around).  Happily these seem to actually touch the entire window.  They have mostly eliminated streaking and the ""missing"" portions when running the wipers.  I prefer the beam type as they seem to streak less and do way better in ice and snow than the traditional framework style blades.I think these are solid wipers and I would recommend them but can't in good conscience give it 5 stars since I don't know how long the water repellency will last.I will update this review and possibly adjust the rating once I've used them for more than a week.Just my thoughts,AK","Solid wiper blade choice, not sure how long the rain x will last though...","Size: 26""Style: Pack of 1Verified Purchase",159 people found this helpful

Even worse, the mounting point also shifted the center of the blade slightly to one side, which meant that the blade exerted more pressure on one side than the other, so the water removal was poor on one side and I had terrible streaking.

I tried to close it with one thumb, one thumb over another thumb, wearing a glove, pressing it with a quarter, pliers, and lightly hammering it without any success.  An Amazon customer replied to my question and said that it was difficult for him/her too and you have to really make pull the plug back snuggly.  I pull it back as much as I could and tried all different ways to close without success over a period of two days.

However, they should think about changing the design to include a longer strip for leverage to make it easier to close it.

These blades simply do not wipe well, they leave streaks in several spots and where they don't leave streaks they do not wipe the water completely clear from the window, they more-or-less smear the water off instead of wipe it off.As other reviews have stated, the blades also have a pretty severe flaw that lets the rubber blade slip out of the blade track. There needs to be an end-cap to prevent this. I somewhat fixed this myself by adding a small bit of Sugru at each end to prevent the blade from slipping out of the track, but I shouldn't have to do this.The water repellency did seem to be applied to the window, so as long as I left my wipers off in the rain I could see better, but this only works in a good rain. The treatment is unfortunately not that effective in light rain or the mist kicked up by cars in front of you, so you do have to use your wipers every once in a while.Rain-x is unbeatable when it comes to their window treatments so I will continue to use the normal liquid treatment, but I cannot recommend these wiper blades to anyone.",Streaky and the blade has a chance of sliding out of it's track,"Size: 26""Style: Pack of 1Verified Purchase",2 people found this helpful
