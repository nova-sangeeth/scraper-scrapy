I was specifically concerned about it fitting the back bench seat which has a 60/40 split.First allow me to address the bucket seat covers. Well they fit over my seats they interfere with the operation of the seat adjustments controls. My passenger seat does not have electric controls and instead has levers. The seat cover on the passenger side interferes with the lovers so they do not operate.The back bench seat cover has issues as well. My Equinox does not have removable headrests so the very first thing I had to do was cut holes in the back part for the entire headrest to go through which meant very large holes instead of small holes for just the poles. The directions show attaching some silver clips to the elastic straps and then clipping them to the back of the seat but I have nowhere on the back of my seat to a heat them. I have no way to attach the bottom elastic straps to anything underneath the bench seat. I am unable to connect them to the other side of the bench seat elastic straps because of the design of the seat there's nowhere for them to go through. The back part along with the extremely large holes for the headrest also do not fit evenly around the bottom of the back rest. So the sides specifically the lower Corners Bunch up and then the entire bottom wants to pull off of the backrest.Overall this is the worst $23 I have spent. I would like to return it but I cut holes in it so it is no longer resellable. I would strongly recommend that nobody purchase. I think I would have better luck sewing a sheet and making my own seat cover.Again, per the Amazon website this would fit my car but it does not.",Worthless,Color: Charcoal GrayVerified Purchase,509 people found this helpful

Try to find a review for the type of car you have before purchasing. There are a lot of negative reviews on these covers because they are ""universal fit"", but they obviously won't fit every type of vehicle perfectly. If you can find a review that is on the vehicle you have or a similar model, that will greatly benefit you before buying these.I purchased a set for my 2011 Ram 1500 pickup after I saw another reviewer has success with these in their 2012 Ram 1500. I really only wanted the front seat covers for my bucket seats, but decided to get these since they included the 2nd row seating too.The front two seat covers worked perfectly, 5/5 stars on that part. They are fairly easy to get on, but they do require a little bit of time and effort. They fit snug which makes install a little harder, but the snug fit is good in the long run. The headrest covers were easy to install as well.The 2nd row seat covers is where they lose a star on the review. The cover for the back of the seat has a zipper to accommodate different types of seats (40/60, 50/50 split), but the bottom seat cover does not and is all one piece. Depending on the vehicle this may work, but in my case it didn't. The back seats in my pickup are a 40/60 split, so you can fold one seat up on the driver's side or two seats up on the passenger's side. If I were to put this cover on it, I would have to fold the whole row of seating at once. Because of this, I decided not to put the covers on the second row seating.One other minor complaint: the front seat covers do not have a hole in the back of them to accommodate the back-seat pockets that are on the backside of the front seats. So if you like to use those for storing maps and such, they will be difficult to get to.Overall though, these are great seat covers for the price if they fit your particular vehicle.",Great seat covers - do your research first.,Color: BlueVerified Purchase,339 people found this helpful

The back seats in the legend don't fold down and attaching the cover correctly would take considerable disassembly.

It covers the front, but not the back, so some of the seat shows through. Our bucket seats have levers, so I had to really shove the covers down into those. That wasn't a huge deal. The back seat cover was the real pain. Our back seat has an area on each back corner where a metal plate is located. You cannot stretch the cover around that plate. It is also very hard to get the cover through the bottom to the back with the top portion. And, without being able to lift the bottom portion, I really had to shove the cover in the back and tuck it. I'm sure seat covers specifically made for my car would be a similar deal, but I mean these were just not made for my car, which was obvious.The only plus was how they looked after I installed them.

One strap broke.The fit is t great. The head rest pieces fit the back but not the font.

I assume the vendor stated it would as well. Will not be returning as it will serve the intended purpose but I am a little disappointed just the same.As an added note, I am a ride share driver and simply bought these to A. protect my existing interior fabric (not in the greatest shape but worth protecting just the same) and B. Give the interior of my car a fresh look vs. the 6 year old look it had.Isntalling the bucket-seat covers was a little frustrating but achieveable. The airbag tag is in the proper place, the seat cover covers the front of the seat well. It was a little arduous to get the cover over the seat back as the foam padding wanted to grip the seat fabric. The rear of the seat cover does not go to the very bottom of the back of the seat, annoying but not terrible. The ""pull bar"" that is meant to be pulled between the gap in the seat to tighten the overall appearance was a bear to push through the passenger side and absolutely impossible to get through on the driver side. Running the straps on the actual seat portion under both seats (wires for air bag sensor on Pass. Side and electronic controls on the Drive. Side) was a challenge but I managed.The bench seat was a whole other animal. One of my draws to this particular set (other than the attractive pricing) was the ability to maintain use of the rear seats center armrest. This is doable, however these covers seem to have been intended for a car which allows the entire back of the seats to fold down vs. the inserts (the impala has 60/40 seating but only the centers of the seats fold down, not the entire ""seat frame"" as it were). I managed to get the top portion to slide over the Impalas back design in a ""good enough"" way but my cars original interior cloth on the backs of the seats is still completely exposed on what could be considered the ""trim."" The bench was also easy enough to apply the cover to, it was actually the easiest to install.Finally, the headrests. The headrests covers DO NOT accurately fit the 2013 impala (and basically any impala between 2006-2013 if memory serves) the rear covers are OK but only because you can't see the backsides of the head rests. The covers for the front headrests ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FIT PROPERLY. There are small tears in both of my front headrests covers right on the elastic band where I had to stretch it to make it fit the headrest. The material began to show ""runs"" (think pantyhose) on the sides where I had to stretch the material to fit, they do not cover the headrest all the way to the bottom.It has improved-ish the look of my vehicle interior and I appreciate the low pricing, I'm disappointed that the overall fit was not a match for my vehicle regardless of Amazon/vendor saying it was.",Does not accurately fit 2013 Impala (or other year models of the same design).,Color: Solid GrayVerified Purchase,

The front 2 seats fit great. No issues at all with those. The backseat however was not as expected. First, you NEED to have an actual BENCH seat, where you can reach all the way underneath. The backseat covers are split into two different pieces. There is one piece for where you sit, and one piece for what your back rests against. It is held together by straps that wrap around the seat. This is fine and all, IF you can reach underneath the seats. My car (2016 Subaru Forester) does not allow that. So, I had to settle for tucking the edge of the cover as far into the crack as I could. It still fits and looks fine, but it's not secure at all, just kind of resting on top of the seat. The second issue I had with the ""seat"" piece, was there were no holes for the seat belt buckle to come through. I had to lay it over the seat, then take a razor blade to cut a slit into the fabric so I could pull the seat belt buckles through. The backrest piece fit easier, as I was able to fold the seats forward and pull the strings through the bottom to attach them behind the seats, however this piece didn't have the holes for the headrests to fit through. But after taking a razor blade to that as well, I was able to push the headrests through. Again, the front seats were great and had a slit for the headrests, the back seats did not.Overall, I am really not that upset, as these were only $22 seat covers...but I still feel it should only deserve 2 stars as it did have quite a few flaws and wasn't what was expected. $22 is still $22.

It's high time Amazon start clamping down on shysters making claims that products fit certain makes and models of car because, by even the most liberal use of the word, these do not ""fit"" this make and model. After a couple of hours I was able to MacGyver these into place, but to say they fit is stretching it. (While we're on the subject of stretching it, beware!)Ok, the front and passenger seat covers are straightforward slipovers. They don't really cover the seats adequately (see above picture) but are passable given the price. Be careful when trying to pull the covers into place; some of the seam joins looked as though they might not take much pulling which is why I settled on the above.For the rear seat, ah yes, this is where the fun and games begin! The only way I was able to get this even close to fitting was to remove the seat bed from the chassis. You'll need to release a pair of front seat clips at the lower front edge of the seat bed, and then reach down the back of the seat bed, between the bed and the back, while tilting the seat bed backward to release two metal hooks; there is one on each end of the seat bed. Subaru might have a diagram on their site to illustrate this maneuver. If you haven't done it previously, a helper might make it easier although it can be done alone.Cover the seat bed with the cloth cover and use the small wire hooks on the elastic loops to fasten the cover onto the seat bed.  Here is a helpful hint: the first time I did this, I covered the seat bed, joined the hooks and then replaced the seat bed. When replacing the seat bed, several of the hooks came apart and I ended up starting over. So, to avoid this frustrating situation, I used a pair of long-nosed pliers to bend the hooks around each other (see above picture.) I considered using small cable ties which might be a good alternative.  Also, be careful when stretching the elastic loops. Some of the stitching holding them on to the cover is very weak; several pulled away (yes, tore off completely!) during this fitting process (see above picture.)Once the seat bed is back in place with the cover attached, I noticed a major design flaw.  The seatbelt locks were completely covered and could only be exposed by stretching the rear edge of the seat cover forward, thus exposing the rear edge of the seat (sea above picture.) Slits for the seat belt locks may have prevented this.The rear back was probably the least well ""fitting"" part of all. What the designers didn't know or take into account was the lower trim of the rear side of the Forester's seat. This severely limits how and where the elastic loops can be poked through. The ""fit"" was also quite loose for this seat back even after tightening up the mass of entangled elastic loops and hooks that covered the rear side of seat back. The upper edge did not allow for the uprights of the headrests and there was no cover that fit the smaller, center head rest.Overall, the materials and workmanship are poor, the design is poor. Not catastrophically poor -- it's possible to get them to sort of fit --  just poor.

The seams and craftsmanship might have been worth the effort if the foam and fabric weren't so thin and fragile. To be clear I purchased this for my Toyota Corolla which is a real vehicle, the quality of this product belongs on a childs toy. I bought two because I thought this was a great value, but I wouldn't pay for something of this quality so I sent them both back.",.99¢ store quality,Color: Charcoal GrayVerified Purchase,

The material lasted years.  The old ones did not have zippers on the rear seat backs.The zippers in the vertical rear seat portion are of extreme poor quality. They are there to accommodate rear split seats. They failed every time a person sat in the rear. All three of the zippers failed at different times.
