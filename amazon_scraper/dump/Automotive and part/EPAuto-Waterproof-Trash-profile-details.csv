It doesn't fit well in my car though. I have a Chrysler T&C and the strap doesn't fit around the center console. So I looped it through one of the arm rests. The strap isn't long enough to fit around both arm rests, so it's a little wonky. It fits nicely on the floor behind the center console but since it's only attached on one side, it tends to flop over if kicked or bumped. I have kids that are constantly in and out of my van, so it's always getting bumped. Fortunately the lid keeps it from spilling the garbage. I also wish the flap on the lid was a bit longer. I like to put trash bags in the can to keep it clean, and there's not much room for the bag to fold over the top of the can with the velcro holding the lid on so close to the top. I hope this all makes sense. Anyway overall it's a nice trash can.

Some reviewers mention it is easy to clean the inside and I am certain that it is, but I wanted a liner.  I could not find anything online, so I used a plastic grocery bag, held up by an inner support brace that I made from the box the shipment came in.  I cut a half inch strip of cardboard and bent it to form the corners of the mouth of this container.  I used a couple of staples to join the two ends, then inserted the plastic bag into the container.  The top of the bag was wrapped over this rube goldberg support brace, and the brace is held in place by a couple of small binder clips, which also help to make the sides of the unit a little more sturdy.  PROBLEMS? . They are minor - there are instructions, but they are vague, would like to see more words to accompany the drawings.  Two side strips are provided, and these are intended to give some rigidity to the edges of the bag.  After looking long and hard for some pouches to slip these into, I realized the intention was simply to have these tucked behind the side straps; the plastic inserts are long enough that you sort of have to wedge them in there, so I imagine the manufacturer is expecting that to hold the black plastic support inserts in place.  We'll see how that lasts over time, but it would be nice to have loops or a pouch to actually hold them in place.  Not a huge deal though - this is a great buy and I am going to order a 2nd one for my other car.",GREAT PRODUCT  |  GREAT VALUE,Color: GreyVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

I work at a busy warehouse fulfilment center so I'm hangin out in my large SUV for breaks/lunch, thus creating plenty of trash, lol. This trash can is a good size and I love the color options so u can match it to ur interior. In my case I got dark gray and have it hooked under my center console lid. The strap length adjuster sits where the console lid hinges are so I have to fiddle with it to get the lid to close without breaking anything. Idk, maybe velcro instead of the plastic slider would fit better in these tight spaces? Anyway, as I said I drive a large SUV, the back middle seat where the trashcan sits does not have enough legroom. This is fine for me but fyi to those with smaller SUVs/sedans who use the backseats where this will go. It seems to be waterproof like it says but I line mine with grocery sacks so haven't tested. Wish it was designed to allow bags to fold around the whole top but u can only fold the sides over the way its designed but grocery sack handles are perfect for this. Those are small things that I see could be improved.The reason for 2 stars overall are the issues I already mentioned and the fact that mine arrived broken. Both front and back sewn in plastic supports were snapped in several places each. Its holding its shape but idk, something about buying a broken product that I dont really care for.

I had a similar size bag hanging from the passenger side headrest and people who went to sit in the back seat would always close the door and go to the other side.

I put a small white plastic bag inside (bathroom waste bag size), which stays when I shut the lid of the black bag. It does not need a white trash bag inside, since the inside is a nice shiny plastic that will wipe down well. But since my parking space at my condo is by the dumpster, I can just open the lid, take out the full bag, tie it and dump it. And truth be told, I am usually too lazy to wipe anything down often.  I need to put spare white bags in the storage net at the side of the black bag. I am getting confused at all the ""bags"" and so FYI, ""black bag"" is the item just bought. I do not put food items in the black bag - just drive-through receipts and empty water bottles. The black bag does look like an insulated lunch bag, but I will not use it as that, since I live in Florida and the heat index outside now is 107 and no ice cube or ice pack would withstand that for more than ten minutes.

There are little canvas straps that go across the unit, and the plastic support rods go in, horizontally, and need to be bent (curved, really) and slid inside of those straps.
