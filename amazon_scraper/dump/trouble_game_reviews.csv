The board is warped so every time you try and pop the bubble all the pieces go flying unless all 4 players constantly hold down their sides with their hands. The pop bubble CAME BROKEN. It was in multiple pieces and now only works if I carefully put it together every time and hold the board down while we're playing. What a piece of junk. Hasboro made me think this was the original version and it's total crap. I'd like to just pay the couple bucks more to get the good version but I had no idea there was a difference when ordering and this version is just a joke.

Here's a suggestion, download the classic instruction sheet from 2002 off the internet. Just search for ""Trouble Game Capital"" and there is the perfect PDF of the good old rules you remember. Box is thinner than a cereal box and opens with tuck in flaps, so get a zipper bag to store the pegs in. By the way, the box is not shrink-wrapped, just sloppily taped shut, so use a knife to slit the tape before opening. They've cut every corner for this game to keep the price low. It's dollar store quality, cheap and cheerful. Ignore the red numeral 1 on the dice, it's for some stupid new rule. Likewise ignore the ""Warp"" and ""XX"" markings on the board and just play by the old rules. Better yet look for a vintage set at a thrift store.

I saw that there was a 'Retro' edition which I remember as the design from my childhood, but it was a lot more expensive than I thought the game should be. I saw that Hasbro had updated the game  and it was really inexpensive. Since this was going to be a bit of an introduction to board games for my kids I didn't want to spend a ton.That should have been my first clue - that the ""retro"" one was almost 3x the price. The product that arrived is so flimsy and cheap on so many levels. The box it comes in is a thin card stock that barely holds its shape. The game board: there are two components that you need put together yourself for some reason. The plastic part is very thin and very wobbly. The card stock insert (which is the same thickness as the box, by the way) is flimsy. Even the playing pieces feel cheap; There's no weight to them at all. They don't stay on the pegs all that well (the original had holes for the pieces to stand in). I can already see that playing this is going to be a bit of a hassle all around. I know that kids get excited and will end up bumping the table or the board, and the pegs are going to go flying off their location because they have no weight to them nor anything to really hold them to their places. The original board and its pieces were very hefty and an incredible quality when compared to this updated version.The only positives I can give this version is the addition to some variant rules, which will come in handy when the kids want a change, and the dice popper functions rather well. I think I might spring for that ""Retro"" version after all.",Lacks In Quality All Around,Verified Purchase,19 people found this helpful

A lot of complaints especially regarding how the paper-thin board graphic sits on top of the thin plastic base. It's important to note that there are two small plastic lips on opposite sides of the plastic board that should hold the graphic in place.  Once I ""installed"" the graphic correctly, we never had issues with it coming off and messing up the board.  It's still fairly easy to knock off the pieces if kids aren't careful, but I see it as a good hand/eye coordination lesson.  I was a bit disappointed with the quality, but had no issues with it once the game got underway.  It's just going to get trashed anyway, especially with young kids.  If they get older and still love the game, spring for a more expensive one, but I assure you, my kids weren't complaining of a cheap game.  They were too busy having fun.  If I had to change one thing, it would be the box the game is stored in.  If that were a little thicker, it would be better.  I don't see it lasting very long and then I'll have to figure out where to keep the board and pieces.

It has some extra gimicks to it, but the game play is essentially the same as always. I loved the game as a kid and was excited that my oldest was ready to play it too.However, Hasbro has really cheaped out in how they're producing the board to the point of making it almost disposable. The game consists of a plastic board with a paper overlay (yes, paper not even card stock) for the board which the pegs fit through. The paper board overlay is, well, thin paper. Mine came already ripped/crumpled in one corner, so was returned. The board is fairly thin plastic, though the pop-o-matic bubble seems to be of reasonable quality (actually hard for a little kid to press). However, since the pieces sit on top of pegs (instead of in cups as in older releases), any time the board is bumped or jostled the pieces are likely to fall out.So still a good game... but if you can find the older boards, it's probably a better bet to go for one of them.

The cardboard insert that forms the playing surface was a little tricky to get in, but once done it stays there.  The die popper works is the same as the old one. I wonder if Hasbro made a better quality one for around $20, would it sell as well?The game has a couple of new twists that make it more interesting, but you could always ignore them and use the old rules. The new board includes re-roll spaces and warp points which jump your piece to the opposite corner of the board. The result is that even if you appear to be a long way behind you can catch up quickly. We played so you always get another turn if you roll a 6 or land on a re-roll space, so you can actually come out of home and get to finish in one series of rolls.Overall a fun twist on an old game, with both the random element from the die-roll and tactical decisions to be made, it works well for all ages.",Cheaply made board but surprisingly sophisticated game play,,

There are a couple of new features compared to the original version I played as a kid.  I think the warp spaces are new.We started playing and I noticed right away the popper does not effectively pop the dice enough to make it randomize enough.  As a result we will continue to pop the same number consecutively which gets really boring and frustrating.

The game pieces are cheap knobs of plastic and the pop die is flimsy but functional. After pulling the board out of storage I found one of my kids (all young kids) must've put it away without the care needed and the game board (if you can call a sheet of paper that) had come loose from a tab in the base, caught the edge of the box on its way in, and became folded--creasing down the middle of the board. The pieces now risk falling off the bumps when we play.Good option for a Tavel game where you're not looking to bright it back with you.

Furthermore, the card piece that fits into the plastic and makes the marked out playing surface does not lie flat (even when tucked under the tabs) and the pieces are so light they don't push the surface down.
