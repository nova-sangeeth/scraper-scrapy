It has saved me so much time on my home improvement projects (which basically means putting furniture together and drilling holes in the walls to mount things). The battery is great and honestly, I can't say how long it lasts because it has never run out while I've been using it. Granted, I only use it for about an hour at most and then I stick the battery back on the charger, but it seems to hold a charge very well too since there have been times when I haven't charged it for about a month, put the battery in the drill, and it still worked as if the battery was full.The drill bits that come with it are standard sizes although I wish the sockets came in more sizes. They are too small for most things I want to use them for.

My issue here is with the quality and durability of drill bits provided as accessories with the item of purchase. As mentioned in product details, I have used it on wood and metal surface drilling. The 3/16 inch drill bit broke off while drilling a wood surface. The tip of 5/16 inch drill bit broke off while drilling a metal surface. Additionally, I drilled on a ceramic surface and that's when the 5/32 inch drill bit broke off. I do understand that ceramic surface wasn't present in product details, but considered it would since the drill works with metals. These incidents didn't happen during first use, but took place within 6-8 months after my purchase as I did use them for multiple jobs at home. Also, the drilling wasn't on bare surface, as I did make a dent with nail before pointing each drill on surface. To ensure this still wasn't because of my naive drilling skills, I purchased a second drill bit set from DeWalt a little less than year ago and used it for the same incomplete tasks at home. However, I don't see a repeat of broken drill bit incidents here. Hence, my review comes at roundabout 1.5 years post my purchase. It's fair to expect that the drill bits coming as accessories with this item should have run longer. On checking the Black & Decker 2-year limited warranty for this item, it appears that accessories aren't part of that limited warranty. As a result, it wasn't a wrong decision purchasing a separate drill bit set. However, an option should be made available to either include accessories (like drill bit) in the limited warranty or not providing them with the item at first place. In that way, customers can purchase this item for a price minus that of accessories and use drill bits of their choice that run longer. But the question about quality of the drill bits offered as accessories on this item still continues to be open for me. As proof, I have provided pictures of the affected drill bits with this review.",Drill bit accessories ruined within first year of purchase,Style: 20V Drill/Driver KitVerified Purchase,10 people found this helpful,10,1,62593673,Public

I had in mind to hang my new 49” TV and assemble a bookcase I bought from Amazon. I saw a review on here that told people not to listen to the reviews of amateurs, but since this drill seems to be marketed to amateurs, I think our opinions do count. I wasn’t expecting to drill holes in my sidewalk or build a house with this sucker—I just wanted a basic handyman’s drill.Full disclosure: I did not charge the drill before first use, so I may not have had full power when attempting to hang my TV. That said, the drill seemed to have trouble driving the included bit into the wall and the wooden stud behind it. Then in reverse, the drill did not seem to have enough torque, even on the maximum setting, to pull the bit out of the wall. The bit kept coming out of the chuck. So my television remains un-hung.The next task I put this drill to (after a full charge) was to screw together the panels of a new bookcase. Keep in mind that the holes were already partially pre-drilled by the bookcase manufacturer, so it should’ve been a piece of cake. Well, it wasn’t terribly difficult to drive the screws in, but the bit kept coming away from the screws, which caused a few little marks on my new bookcase. By the time the screws were installed properly, many of the heads were partially stripped, and what’s worse, there were little metal shavings deposited on the bookcase. I’ve used other people’s power drills before and never encountered this issue. As I was assembling the bookcase next to one of my cats’ dishes, I had to toss the food and wash the bowl out just in case some metal shavings had fallen in—better safe than sorry.I honestly can’t recommend this as either a basic drill or as an electric screwdriver. I’m returning this and will be saving my money up for a Milwaukee or even Ryobi at the hardware store.",Inadequate Even as a Basic Tool,Style: 20V Drill/Driver KitVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,213,56,252377,Public

Though it is a 20V Drill, it is about half the size of any other drill I have ever owned - some that are even less powerful than this one claimed to be. I will be honest, I was rather skeptical of how well it would work just by its size. I guess size isn't everything though. After using it a few times, I started to get a feel for it and I was willing to use it for more heavy duty projects. I have found that this small drill, which is an amazing size to keep in a compact carrying case, is very powerful, while also remaining pretty quiet. The chuck works very smoothly as well, no issues holding the bits, breaking, sticking, or falling out. The size and weight make it VERY easy to use and that is something I am thankful for. In the past, I have stayed away from my husband's tools because of the size and power, but this is a drill for everyone. I am not 100% on giving this drill 5/5 just yet, but after a few more major home improvement projects I will let you know, our next one will be putting it through the ultimate test.","Lightweight, compact, quiet, small but powerful!",Style: 20V Drill/Driver KitVerified Purchase,26 people found this helpful,3442,326,2624,Public

I purchased it when I began a long-term home renovation project two years ago and have used it extensively since then.  To date, it has been used to install numerous fixtures (lights, fans, etc.), drill and assemble custom built shelves, fasten over 2,000 square feet of drywall, fasten cement board for tile floors and backer board for custom showers, and many other tasks.A few specific notes:1.  The battery life is great; however, you may notice a bit of a battery drain when performing heavy duty tasks like driving self-tapping screws into backer board (which is extremely dense, so the drill has to work very hard to complete this task).  Even when performing this task, I did not find myself running out of battery power in the middle of tasks.  I typically charge the battery every few days, but I found myself needing to charge the battery on a nightly or semi-nightly basis (which is still not bad at all) when taxing the drill heavily.  I have never needed to purchase a second battery because one charge easily lasts through a full day of consistent use.2.  This drill measures up very well against other cordless drills of the same class.  When people have helped me to hang drywall and backer board, their drills have not been able to accomplish the tasks as easily as this one.  I have handed my drill to other people on numerous occasions so that they could drive screws the rest of the way after their cordless drills could not complete the task.3.  There are some natural limitations with this drill, but that is to be expected with a cordless drill.  For example, I can use this drill with large hole saw bits; however, it is significantly faster to use my 6 amp corded drill for this work.  Similarly, when using a spade bit to drill through multiple 2x4 headers, it is much faster to use a more powerful drill.  This drill can do the job, but it will take more time since it is simply not the right tool for that particular job.Summary:  If this drill is used for the right tasks and is treated well, it will perform better than many drills that occupy higher price ranges and it will also last for a very long time.  I have put this drill through its paces many times over in the last two years and it has never disappointed me.",The right tool for the right job(s),Style: 20V Drill/Driver KitVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,115,110,244413,Public

Drywall? anything harder? Click Click Click Click Click. No power. I got halfway into studs on a full charge and couldnt sink the screws into the drywall. They went in, but didn't sink down.

At first, this little drill started to sweat. I was thinking buying this was a bad idea... but... I didn't give up. So first off, I made sure the battery was fully charged... which by the way, takes a LONG time to do, upwards of 3-4hrs. Well, it got fully charged, and boom, huge difference.Also, you have to make sure you're using the right drill bit... there's three types: The multi-purpose drill (which is what you should use for metal), the masonry bit, and the carpenter's bit (forgot the name).

Be careful, since it's really easy to accidentally press down the button that switches the spin to reverse . So, now, with:1. Full battery2. Appropriate drill bit3.

I've done fence repairs quickly and painlessly with this thing. Battery life has not been an issue for any of my projects thus far. And it comes with a decent array of bits!

After 30 minutes of unsuccessfully trying to make the holes and having to patch the wall with wood filler, I gave up and got an extension cord. 2 minutes later, there were 2 perfectly straight holes made in the wall by the plug in drill. After screwing in two long screws into the 2 holes in the studs, I thought I would test this electric screwdriver to see whether it could unscrew them. Shockingly, they could not.Unfortunately I had to return. I hope they edit their Amazon listing to be more accurate so customers won't be misled.

I'm used to having to charge up a battery before using the drill with my old Black and Decker drill I bought a long time.  Charged pretty quick right after I got it, didn't have to charge it over night like my old 18v drill.  That was great because I wanted to use it right away.  I looked around Amazon for other Black and Decker stuff that uses 20v batteries and it looks like a ton of other power tools and garden tools can work off the same battery.  I'm definitely going to check out more of the 20v garden tools for my yard this spring!So far after a month of using this drill around the house I've been very pleased because it has been able to do everything I've needed to do.

Not Lexus-quality, but Toyota-quality.  My earlier, lower-quality drill has quite a bit of wobble and play in it.  That gets magnified if you use a long attachment.  That meant many times the drill jumped-out of the #2 screws I mostly worked on, or it damaged the screws a bit by the time I was done.  This drill is built to much tighter tolerance and it seems to jump-out of the screws a lot less.  Also I see less (but still some) metal residue on the bit after turning a screw.Lots of torqueExcellent speed control.  You can turn a screw at exactly the speed you want.  This is very helpful in avoiding over-torquing and having the bit jump out of the screw.I do small projects around the house, so still on my first chargeNice weight.  Not too heavy.*** Cons:No strong negatives.  I looked at much much more expensive drills and wished for some extra features, so sharing that just FYI:1] Many drills have LEDs that spotlight your work area.  This one didn't.2] Built-in horizontal and vertical level would have been nice, though I never used the ones in my earlier drill.3] I much prefer drill/drivers because their stubby snouts make them much more handy to maneuver into tight spots.  This drill has a traditional profile.  Now add a longish bit to get into a tight spot and you've got something that's nearly a foot long!4] Top-of-the line drill/drivers costing 3-5 times more, are brushless.  That means much longer battery life and no carbon brushes to wear-out.  If you're willing to pay extra for quality, it might be an idea to look at brushless drill/drivers as well.  I could have bought one of those myself, but in the end felt my very light use didn't justify such an expensive tool.*** ConclusionEvery product offers a balance of price/performance.  This drill is excellent for its price.Highly recommended at its price.","For this price, it can't be beat",Style: 20V Drill/Driver KitVerified Purchase,222 people found this helpful,285,38,78610378,Public

I'm not doing any voluntary DIY projects, but hanging pictures, fixing door handles, putting together furniture (you get the picture) is normal for me.After reading through different reviews on Amazon and watching youtube videos I decided on the Black and Decker and I'm very happy with my purchase.Pro's- The battery life is great, I've never done anything where I needed to stop halfway through to charge the battery (plus you can get spares). I think another reviewer said it lasted him around 4 hours. - The torque is great. I've never had one problem drilling or removing screws. - Hard to explain, but I feel as if I have more control over the speed / power im putting out vs my old dewalt drill. -  Relatively lightweight and ergonomically designed.Neutral - - The accessories are decent. The bits seem like cheapish steel to me, but the assortment is nice to have / I saw it as a bonus anyways.Cons - - There are no glaring cons, assuming the fact that you treat this like the starter kit it is. But It's not the most powerful drill, isn't the most complete kit, doesn't come with a drill case or bag, etc.The one thing I didn't realize was they didn't include any allen bits, which stinks because I specifically bought the drill to put together an IKEA desk. (which I find very odd as they included Robertson bits) As a side note, I ended up getting the baker and bolt allen bits and they are incredible quality. https://www.amazon.com/Baker-Bolt-Wrench-COMPLETE-Magnetic/dp/B07GVSV5R7/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=baker+and+bolt&qid=1576546921&sr=8-2 - I highly recommend those too.All in all, this is a great drill kit for the value.

I am surprised. It has built a lot of stuff since I have bought it. I probably have over 50 hours of operating time behind it now. It has helped me build some beds, desks, storage boxes, shelves and a garden. My only complaint is that it only comes with one battery - make sure to order a second one so you don't end up being forced to take breaks - ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PUNCHING THROUGH METAL OR HARDWOOD/COMPOSITES!I did notice that the drill can get quite hot. I read a few reviews that say units burn out. I think if you do not pay attention here you can kill the drill if you are not careful, the good news is, it does not get hot often, and when it does it does not take long for it to cool back down with the way the vents are set up.My advice is - if you want something really heavy duty you may want to get a brand better known for that. Dewalt for example - will be a much sturdier drill than this. However, if you want a cheap drill that can get you through projects - get this one. Pay attention to the heat like you should with anything and you will be happy.",Great for prototyping engineers - bad for job sites.

I bought this drill months ago, I've been using it sporadically for about 4 major projects and a few minor uses here and there... I have not had to recharge the battery once! What?! That is incredible.I don't often leave five star reviews, but the battery life is just killing me. I'm so impressed. I decided, after MONTHS of use, to charge it today just in case (but actually, it has lost zero power in the drill as most drills do when the battery is low.)
