These are not the best filters you can buy - but I will tell you for the money - they work great.  I have a friend in the industry that told me to stop buying the crazy expensive filters - and just buy cheaper filters and replace them more often.So after using these for 3 months - I have found them to perform as good as the comparable brand that I can buy at the big box store.  And I really like that I found ones online that I like, so I can just order them from Amazon.I think these are a great value - they compare to ones that cost a bit more -and do a great job.I also run my fan in the house all the time.  24/7.  I do this because it keeps the house balanced better.  Winter and Summer.  Now there is a great debate about leaving your fan on AUTO or ON.  You can read that debate and decide for yourself it its worth it.  But just know, I run mine 24/7 and use these filters.

I saw a review saying they weren’t the right size, but ignored them as I was in a hurry and figured they messed up ordering the wrong product. Clearly, they were correct. I can’t believe they sell these as one size and then list a smaller “actual size”. Um, I’m sorry, this isn’t a product that needs a lot of tolerance. It should be the correct size or very slightly smaller. There is so much room that the filter won't do anything as the air will just go around this. I managed to wedge it in the side, but am throwing the other 3 away. I wish I had just returned them.Let’s be honest, these filters sole purpose is to protect your furnace, not to be a whole home air filter. If you’re using it for that, you’re doing it wrong.

Here is what MERV 8 is designed for:MERV 5 – 8Most commercial applications and better residential buildings75%-85% of all particles in your air would be trapped in the filter. You can also going higher MERV ratings which will increase particle collection. The MERV rating goes up to MERV16 which traps 95% of airborne particles.These filters are perfect for residential use. Hope this helps a little bit to better understand these acronyms and what filter is best because I had no clue until doing a little research. Also the filters edge is easy to bend, thus I warn to be very gently when installing. I would start with one sides edges first.

I don’t know how other houses are set up, but our returns in our house (the area you put these filters) have bolts and screws on the inside, so I used to have to really wedge in filters that were the “true” size. It always took 5 minutes or so of force before with older, bigger filters to force them in, but these just pop in.The actual quality itself is great. It’s a MERV rating of 8 (more than enough for most residential households) and quality wise it’s better than comparable priced filters you’ll find at other department stores. We actually got a new HVAC system installed and I asked the technicians about these and they said they were great and not to overpay for other brands (unless you REALLY need a higher allergy rating or other specialized filter for pets).Overall - highly recommended.

I usually purchase the mid-grade filters (that are comparable to this one on paper) or the next filter grade up from that. Their performance was fine, but the prices have been going up. Like many things before this, I shifted to Amazon to save some money. After looking at the good ratings, I concluded that the Silver grade FilterBuy filter would meet my needs and I bought a 4-pack in the 16x25x1 size.The good:  The filters arrived quickly and undamaged. They looked like the other good-quality filters I’m accustomed to. While all other filters I have purchased for this furnace have been slightly bigger than the slot and a struggle to install and take out, this filter has slightly smaller dimensions all around and slid right in without a fuss. I was off to a good start.The bad:  A few weeks after installing the first filter in the Fall, I noticed dust was accumulating on our flat surfaces faster than usual after dusting. I didn’t think much of it at first, but over the course of three months I suspected the new filter wasn’t doing its job. My suspicions were confirmed when I pulled the filter to replace it.  Having lived in my house for 25 years, I know what to expect in terms of dirt on the filter when I change it at the end of December. This filter was nowhere near as dirty, meaning it wasn’t stopping the dust effectively. When held up to the light, where my prior dirty filters would show only the faint sign of light, I not only saw a lot of light but also the fixture itself through small holes throughout the filter. Unfortunately, the experience with the second filter I changed at the end of March was no better. While I’m sure results will vary depending on furnace, ductwork, environment, etc., in my case the FilterBuy Silver filter did not perform as well as the other more expensive mid-grade name brand filters I have used.  If their higher-grade filter is less expensive than the other mid-grade options, I may give that a try.",It's not stopping the dust,Size: 16x25x1Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

The filter is about half a centimeter short in both dimensions.  I've attached pictures to illustrate.  For comparison is a (dirty) 20x30x1 furnace filter of similar MERV rating bought at an orange store.  Two pictures show the gaps in both dimensions between the old filter and the new FilterBuy product.

You can count the number of pleats in the medium of each filter for yourself.  There are quite a few more pleats in the old filter.  I believe more filtering medium produces cleaner filtered air, given the same MERV rating.  Furthermore, you can see there is more cardboard material securing the medium in place.  What you can't see is that the old filter is also better secured in place by that criss-cross cardboard pattern:  I plucked at a cardboard strip on the FilterBuy product, and it separated from the filtering medium easily.  This did not happen with the old filter, and I pulled at its cardboard strips much harder.I'll use these filters, but I won't buy them again.

I do not have the issue as many do about the size. I have 25X25X1 inch filters. To address the build quality-- I am sorry but these were questionable to me as soon as I held them in my hands. I did not feel confident at all.  I have deduced that these are restricting enough air flow to by coils that it is leaking water on the filter. And that is bad for these specifically as they immediately warp with just a minute amount of water. Water is dropping from my coils on top of the filter and as a result it is inhibiting aire flow and results in more water at a faster rate.

While you may hear that dirty filters clean the air more, filters that are overly dirty block airflow and significantly reduce the overall filtration effect.  If the air can't get through the filter, it can never be filtered!  So, care about your air quality and change your filters often: let the filter do what it is designed to do.  Furthermore, be careful about installing a higher MERV than your system is designed for.  Higher MERV filters generally have higher resistance which can reduce the airflow of your HVAC system and cause a number of operational issues with your system including reduced heating/cooling performance, poor air distribution, fan failure, alarms, etc.",Change your filters regularly!

Instead of having the tight fit of the filter hold it in it's place, the metal cover / grate keeps it from falling out of the ceiling. When the fan turns on, the filter is sucked up to where it should always be, and it makes the expected noise of a filter being seated in it's intended place. When the fan shuts off (every time), the filter then falls back down (due to the absence of suction holding it in place) on to the metal cover / grate, again making another unexpected noise (and will probably cause contaminates to drop down on to my desk below, once it starts to get dusty).Seemed to be a great value, and a decent quality product, but because they don't fit they way they should (because they are not truly the size they are advertised to be), I definitely won't be buying more.Lastly.

One minor complaint - filter is slightly smaller than most others. The 24x14 is actually 23.5x13.5. Most other brands actual size is 1/4th inch or less smaller than the advertised size. The consequence is that the filter is NOT held in place by the friction tabs in the frame. Even bending them out was not enough. When the fan cuts on and off the filter shifts in the ceiling return making a tapping noise. A shim made of thick corrugated cardboard remedied that.
