Like all hair catching devices some hair does get through into the pipes.  The video advertising shows ALL the hair being caught, but that is not 100% accurate.  My wife has long hair and with this product I still have to use a drain cleaner from time to time, and use a hair pull-out tool to remove hair that went straight by the TubShroom.  I stopped using it, because over time mold started to grow on it.  I could bleach it to remove the mold, but I opted to go back to one of these for $5.00 which works just as good.(https://www.amazon.com/Danco-Bathroom-Strainer-Microban-10306/dp/B004L04X5S/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1515778106&sr=8-4&keywords=tub+drain+hair+catcher).

I see my life divided into two distinct periods centered on one singular event: the gloomy, pestilent dark ages before TubShroom, and all the glorious, magnificence days thereafter. No amount of glowing, favorable adjectives will ever do justice to the magnificence of the TubShroom. These are but feeble, limiting words, which by their very nature, cannot capture the richness, splendor and transcendent power that is the TubShroom. In the search for truth, the world’s greatest mathematicians, physicists, and philosophers have all skirted around the wisdom of the TubShroom. In its form perhaps lies the Theory of Everything, a unification of the quantum world with gravitation.  The Freemasons, the Illuminati, all secret societies cherish and hold the principles of the TubShroom to the highest honor.

Then you have to empty it while the shower is already running, potentially washing more hair down the drain while you pull it out to empty it.

The TubShroom only works if you have an open drain. If you have an attached metal stopper, then you will need to remove the stopper. Most just unscrew from the drain.Most drains have a metal cross across the hole just a few inches or less from the service. This stops large items from going down the drain but also helps secure the stoppers in place. When we use the TubShroom that metal cross only allows the the Tubshroom only to go down about halfway.Because of this water flows easily around the device and hair and other debris collect on the TubShroom. If your drain does not have this metal cross Only install the device halfway. This will keep your drain flowing freely.I would suggest cleaning the TubShroom after each use or at least once a day. It does collect a lot of hair.

It's a older tub but didn't realize it would stick out that much.  Pushing it into the drain, the bottom rubber gets bent in all weird ways and it starts leaning to the right/left of the drain, although it is in there.

I wish it was a bit shorter for the older types of tub/drains.  I did measure it and it seems to be the right size opening, but I think mine is one size on the opening and then starts to get a bit smaller, plus there is a bar there that prevents this from pushing in more.I'm a bit torn between the giving it a 3/4 star because overall it does what it was intended and a great idea, but just not the right size/style for my tub.

The shower drain would get clogged every month or two. I would use products like liquid plumbr that would help but the problem would come back in about 1-3 months. I bought this product in Sept. 2018. It worked great for about 6 months. It caught all the human and cat hair from going down the drain. It also catches a lot of soap scum and at times can slow down water drainage because of this. Doesn't happen with all soaps, but certain soaps and shampoos kind of get stuck in the holes and cause water to drain slower. I noticed back around May/June of this year, my drain started clogging up/draining slowly again. I think it's because all of the disgusting black build up that is on the inside of all the holes and the entire bottom of the TubShroom. I think this has slowed water drainage enough for me to notice a puddle while I'm showering. As time has went on, the build up has gotten worse. I would clean this every week  why is it getting so black everywhere? There is no way to clean off this black grime, I've tried, and it's disgusting. I think i'll be replacing this with a metal hair strainer instead. While it works for a time, the amount of time it takes to clean this thing in order to avoid build up isn't worth it in the end. It is that reason that I would not recommend this product.

A simple wipe with some paper towel or toilet paper and it's clean. Occasionally I do wash it with soap as it gets slimy and gunky.Cons:~ Perhaps it's my drain size being too small or me pushing the tub shroom in too deep, but since the tub shroom fits so snuggly in the drain the water pools around my ankles. It's not just a small amount either it literally goes up past my ankles if I take a 30 min shower. It's something I can live with but my boyfriend hates it.~ Because of the water pooling there is a lot of soap scum that is left from the water draining through the tub shroom; all around both the tub and the shower curtain. This means more running water after I leave the shower to rinse off the tub.Other notable mentions is that I have had to clean it in the middle of bathing the dog and cat simply because it gets so clogged up.I would post a picture but no one wants to see that nastiness.

Because those are IN the drain, it's not a huge deal or eye-sore, it's just the knowledge and frustration that they are there and cause it to back-up so much faster.

It’s a great product & does exactly what it says it does. But i honesty can say i’d pay $14 again for another one when I can get a cheap couple-dollar metal hair strainer from Home Depot. I’m not sure how long this rubber will last either vs I know a metal strainer will last a lot longer. It does catch my hair & it’s totally cool how they thought to make this product. It can move a bit to the side if you accidentally hit it. On the positive this strainer does catch lots of hair while still allowing the water to flow freely so you don’t have to take the hair out of the strainer for a few days if you want. For me one shower & it’s about 1/3 full of hair. It’s easy to remove & install. The hair is also pretty easy to take out (some pulling is required). Overall I wouldn’t buy this again unless you’re looking for a strainer that catches hair with free flowing water & don’t mind the price.,Good concept but not for this price,Color: GrayVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,147,101,116050,Public

I got one of these hoping it would help prevent the drain from clogging. We've been using it for about a week so far, although it was easy to install, I'm not entirely sure that it works any better than our standard drain cover. I seem to have to clean it at the same rate and remove a similar amount of hair. We have not had the issues of water pooling like others have, but we don't use heavy body wash or hair products.One of the things I really don't like about this device is that in order to install it I had to remove the chrome drain cover and in our tub there is no hardware underneath, so the gray silicone just sits on top of a grungy looking unfinished metal drain (see pictures but forgive the dirty tub). I know this is more an issue of tub installation, but there honestly is no reason that the area under the drain cover would be aesthetically pleasing, so all of the product pictures are a bit misleading. Unless you have a stopper plug on your tub, there is a good chance what is under the standard drain cover isn't too nice to look at. Our bathroom was renovated and a new tub was installed less than 2 years ago.If anyone knows where I can buy a cover for the ring in either chrome or brushed silver color, or white plastic or gray silicone to match my tub or TubShroom, please advise.Update May 4, 2017: This think gets gunky and nasty over time and will also stain/discolor. Also, when I remove it from the tub there is hair/gunk clinging onto the little metal cross piece in the drain. I like to think that it is still helping more yuck from getting down the drain, but I'm not really sure. It's easy enough to clean but we need to wipe it down a few times a week and then clean it thoroughly (stretching out all the holes to get the gunk unstuck) on a weekly basis. We have definitely experienced water backup, but not when the TubShroom is clean, so I think that's more of an issue with how much gunk is getting caught and less of a device flaw.Super big thanks to dweezil who figured out what that part of the tub is called - it's a tub strainer body! I'm going to have my partner look into them and see if we can install one to make our tub look prettier with this installed.

I have used a few other tub drain strainers in the past and they did not work as effectively as the TubShroom.My wife has long, thick hair and I have an above-average amount of body hair. As a result, I used to have to use an powered auger to snake my main sewer line about once per year (keep in mind... this would happen after it backed up drains and flooded our basement) and a small velcro snake for my tub drain about once every three months, and since I started using the TubShroom I no longer need to snake my drains.

So, I ask these consumers: ""What would you rather deal with - a little puddle in the tub everyday or hiring a plumber to unclog your drain on at least an annual basis (which will cost you a minimum of $200)?"" For me, the answer is obvious!

It worked great and did it’s job. It collected all the hair and I had to clean it out after every 2 showers because the water wouldn’t drain. After 2 months of having it, it broke. The top part just popped off and it wouldn’t go back on. Not going to but the metal one again. So I was really disappointed because it was kinda expensive so I got the flat drain covers that you just lay over your drain. It was meant to catch hair but after a week of using it , it hardly caught any hair. So that was basically a joke. I did more research and I found this rubber tubshroom! I was a little skeptical to buy it because my first one broke. So I ended up buying it anyways because I really liked my last metal one.Review :  This one is definitely  perfect ! It’s all rubber so I don’t have to worry about it breaking ( the top part coming off ) and it’s easy to clean. It catches my hair, my hair length is medium to long and I have been shedding like crazy.  I also gave my dog a bath and it caught his hair too.  I highly recommend it. This is the way to go if you don’t want hair going down the drain.

I had put in one of those push down stoppers that allows you to fill the tub and had to unscrew it to install this which isn't really an issue since we never really take bathes. If you have the old style drain with the handle on the tub to close the drain I think you would just have to remove the screen from the floor drain to install this which would still allow you to fill the tub and catch any hair.

I shed more than any human should. I thought I was being clever with my questionable hair-art projects on the shower wall. No way I was letting any hair escape to the drain. Our tub had to be clogging because of all the car liquids and gunk my mechanic husband was washing away. Life went on.I avoided mechanically clearing that clogged up drain for so long. I was still processing the first time I did that. It was at my first ever ""I'm an adult now"" rental. Y'all... I have a strong stomach for grossness. I gagged the whole time I was pulling that hairball out of my drain. I was CERTAIN it was a dead mouse.It wasn't. It was hair.Finally, this year, it was time. Like I said, I was prepared to scoop grease and grime out of the drain, courtesy of the husband....yeah. No. It was all me. One giant hairball. It had to be close to sentience. For every hair I caught before it hit the drain? There was another that slipped by. And another. And another.Bought the tubshroom that night. Bought the cover for it, because I can't be giving up those long soaks in the tub. Got the drain nice and clear. Got the tub nice and clean. Popped the tubshroom in. Haven't had a single problem since.Sure, it's a little yucky to clean the tubshroom.

Sure, it'd take some time, but once it did it was a huge pain.  I can't really use any stronger pipe cleaners due to my home's mix of different pipes, the softer ones never worked properly, and my snake access pipe only lets the smallest snake heads through.In short: The drain clogged yearly, and every time it was me spending a couple hours cussing at it before calling a plumber and paying for that instead.I'd tried other solutions; mesh baskets, rubber coverings, etc. but they all had issues with water flow.  Sure they caught hair, but it required weekly if not daily cleaning, and even on the best of days I'd still have issues with water not draining fast enough and standing around in the water.  I'd bought this almost solely due to it being something, anything different to try and it was relatively inexpensive.Imagine my surprise when I found it works *perfectly*.  The top of the ""stalk"" sticks out an inch or two from the bottom of the tub.  The bottom of the stalk forms a watertight seal against the sides of the drain.  This means that water all has to flow through the stalk, and hair invariably just accumulates around the sides of it.  Fresh out of the box or after cleaning I have zero issues with standing water while I shower.  Cleaning it isn't *quite* as simple as the advertising may have you believe but it's commendably close.  Grab a couple sheets of toilet paper, pinch off the hair, repeat, then throw away.  You'll know you need to when water doesn't drain as fast, which in my case is maybe once or twice a month.As such this product is one I felt compelled to review.  Not only is it inexpensive but it works nearly flawlessly.","Buy this, and forget about your drain clogging going forward",Color: WhiteVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,11,9,2742412,Public

The TunShroom is the first hair catcher that actually fits into the drain. It has a little lip on the bottom that seems to catch every strand of hair, preventing it from going down the drain. It's made of a flexible silicone that won't rust and washes of easily. It serms to be very thick and sturdy.After a few showers, I decided to pull out the Tub Shroom to see how much hair it caught. I was pretty horrified at how much hair was wrapped around it in just a matter of days! It was actually pretty gross, to be honest. I was able to quickly and easily grab the hair off with a Kleenex, give it a quick rinse, and stick it back in the tub.I am extremely pleased with how well the TubShroom works.

My hair is thick and extends all the way down my back to my rear.  Needless to say, I have to wash my hair every day.  Prior to purchasing the TubShroom, I used the regular hair trap that can be purchased in any local store.  The problem with the old design is that it does not create a seal so hair would inevitably wind up down the drain and would, over time, build up within the drain and have to be pulled out.  Yuck!  With the TubShroom, this does not happen.  The hair wraps itself around the center and is very easy to remove.  I place the TubShroom in the drain before showering, remove it when done, remove the hair and throw it away, and then I place the TubShroom on a hook to allow it to dry.One of the reviews that I remember reading complained about mold build up.  Well, wherever you have water, you will have mold build up if you choose to leave it immersed in water.  Removing it from the drain and setting it aside to dry prevents this from happening.  I have used this daily for two months and have never had an issue with mold.If you have long hair, I highly recommend this product.

Hair warrants drain issues and quite a ton of snaking if you don’t commit to hair preventions.Better than competitors.I tried to buy a standard drainer that catches hair similar to the one I use in my kitchen sink. Only issue is that the soap that runs through it eventually hardens and clogs up any water from passing through the net. It then acts like a shower plug. So every wash, I had to clean it right after or else it would clog up my bathtub, and it was difficult as it needed a thorough scrub to clean every small hole of the net.TubShroom was 100X easier - no joke! Because the holes in the tubshroom is much larger (and doesn’t impact its ability to catch hair due to the design) it filters the water without any soap clogs. This means I can shower as many times as I want without worrying that my shower will turn into a gross bath during my shower.When I do clean it, it’s literally grabbing the bottom part of the tubshroom to remove any hair caught - easier than cleaning my hair brush by far because it slides right off. I do appreciate how flexible the material is and how easy it is to clean!Also, keep in mind - I didn’t even measure the bathtub hole, and I rent so in terms of this fitting the standard bathtub, I can verify this will fit and will satisfy your need.Overall I’m pleased with my experience and will continue to use this product until I need to replace it!",Easy to Clean & Doesn’t Water Clog!!,Color: GrayVerified Purchase,,20,7,6839877,Public

It says it catches every single hair every time which is true. However, let’s talk this through. If it catches every single on of my hairs as I shampoo my mid length hair and then soap up to wash, the water backs up into the tub because it can’t filter through the clogged up tub shroom. Now my feet are soaking in grimy water and my bathtub has a stubborn stuck on soap scum ring. And yes, I do clear it after each shower. It is slimy with shampoo, conditioner, and soap.

Most of others I know catch hair not so effectively and slow down drainage at the same time because caught hair  clogs holes.

It is not a  big deal : I just take a piece of paper towel to remove hair and after that clean its holes of soap accumulation under hot water's flow from faucet. Tubshroom is very soft - just bend it under water flow and you are done in several seconds.Not completely sure it catches ""every single hair"" as manufacturer claims but very close to that.

All the hair that had gone down was indeed caught and very, very simple to remove from the spool. I grabbed tissue and just ""peeled"" the hair off and threw away the trash. Voila!

Once a month I used to have to use chemicals to declog our shower drain as the amount of hair coming from my long hair and my teenage daughters made it so the shower would clog up and provide us with three to four inches of standing water. It was a real pain in the butt, a constant added expense, and made the tub constantly feel and look dirty. I bought this hoping it would catch the hair as advertised causing the drain to not clog. This tiny little device is a true miracle!!! We've been using it for almost 3 months now and I have yet to need to use chemicals 2 declogged pipes as we have ZERO clogs!! I do have to remove the plug everyday to remove the hair that has collected otherwise the tub will not drain. Cleaning the plug is a nasty job as you can imagine hair soap scum Etc. The only true negative that I have found is that the in side of the plug is hard to clean as the soap scum collects to it and using a tissue simply won't clean it. About once a week I have to go in with a pipe cleaner or bottle brush to clean and sanitize the inside of the plug cylinder.***update*** its been about 6 months or so and I just purchased a new poo be. The original got too nasty. These are really hard to clean and clog up with soap scum, body fluids etc quickly. After a while its time to toss and replace. Still even with replacing 2 times a year its a bargain compared to using chemicals 4 + times a year! Product works great and I still give it 5 stars.I just wish it was easier to clean!",AMAZING!

The genius is that the hair and scum get wrapped around the tubular part that sits - invisibly - down inside the drain.  Yes, your drain will get slow after about 10 showers or so and you need to remove the hair, clear away as much of the gunk as possible.  But you don't have to worry about getting it all, just most of it.  Why spend time and elbow grease really cleaning something like this just to avoid having something ugly down in your shower?  This takes care of it; the top stays clean and it's all you ever see.  No offensive soap-scum.  The lower part may get stained, but you only see it when you're cleaning it.I found that this does NOT slow my drain appreciably when it has been recently cleaned.  I love that it's soft and doesn't hurt toes if stepped on or kicked.  I love that I only have to clear away hair and not worry about cleaning the thing for presentation's sake; I can just wipe the hair away and put it back, done.

Provided it gets emptied every other day or so, water is able to flow freely down the drain where it belongs. The only real drawback is having to reinstall the drain plug whenever we want to take a bath instead of a shower.If you do put off cleaning the device, it can start to grow mildew and mold.

Earlier this year I was having hair thinning issues from an autoimmune disease I have, and since my hair was about 8-10"" long, it was miserable washing my hair, both for me and my tub drain.

I also have an old tub with a weird drain size, so it was a relief that it fit so well.The only non-issue that I have is that I had to unscrew my tub stopper to use this, which means I have to screw it back in if I want to plug the tub to fill it, but with how well this tub shroom works, I have zero problems with that.
