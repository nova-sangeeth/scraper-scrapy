We just got our echo a few months ago. I’ve been a prime member for over 10 years so I’m familiar with how amazon has changed life as we knew it (for me anyway). I saw the amazon smart plug when I was searching for any brand smart plug that had Alexa control with it. It’s been in my cart saved for later for at least a month! I finally decided to just pre order it so that I could review it and hopefully help other people that are like me and have fallen way behind in the tech field. For reference I’m an almost 34 year old mom of 2. This means that my 8 year old stole my iPad, iMac, and I haven’t had a computer of my own in about 4 years! So I do everything from my iPhone. I’ve had some weird issues with our echo and my Alexa app that it will just randomly pause a song so I’m not sure what that is about.ANYWAY! I received my new amazon smart plug the day it was released (so glad it’s not like a new iPhone or PlayStation where people camp out ahead of time or do people still do this??). It was easier than I expected but harder than was described in the listing because my Alexa didn’t just recognize it.Setup:Since my Alexa didn’t recognize it on its own, I had to unplug the smart plug and quickly scan the code on the back of the plug, then plug it back in fast so that when it scanned for it it would see it plugged in. After that it was very simple. I was able to plug in my baby monitor and then tell Alexa to “turn off plug one” and it turned off! It is so cool!Future:I think homes will end up being built with these right into the electrical system. Maybe they already are.Comparing:With so many different brands offering smart plugs with Alexa integration I can’t see myself buying any more than 1 for $25.  Too many are 2 for $20. While it’s nice to have the amazon support backing this up, I just can’t afford to fill my home with them at such a high cost comparative to other brands that do the same exact thing.Overall:If you can afford to fill your plugs with these then do! This smart plug is easy and awesome! But if you’re on a tight budget like I am, I would try a different brand first and see if those will work just as well.Every time I purchase something online, I always check the reviews. I count on others to help me choose the best option. My reviews are always my honest opinion and I try to include photos if possible.If my review has helped you in any way, please click the ""helpful"" button below so that I know!

They've worked ok and rules are easy to set up BUT, like any other smart plug, WeMo requires users to manage smart plugs using the WeMo app.  The WeMo smart plugs were relatively easy to set up with Alexa, however, the moment there was a power outage, reboot of router, etc. they have been a royal pain to get back online.I received my new Amazon Smart Plug today and the setup was very easy and took minimal time.  This was so much easier dealing with one single app (Alexa) that I will now be replacing all of my WeMo devices.  I would have given it 5 stars but using the scheduling option (days and times) in Alexa required too many steps.  Users should ideally be able to add start times, stop times and days when creating a schedule versus creating separate schedules for start and stop times.  Perhaps a lower price would be good.  Not just because I want a less expensive product but more importantly, many people have already invested a lot of money with their current smart plugs.  For example, over the past years I've added (7) WeMo plugs at an average cost of $30 each and $210 for all (7).  Personally, I think it would be a wise decision for Amazon to drop their price so that they can win over customers like me at a faster rate.",Best Plug for Echo,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,"2,025 people found this helpful",2063,22,119554,Public

I plugged it into an outlet and within a few seconds the Alexa app on my phone recognized it as a new device, prompted me to give it a name, and I was all set!  Awesomeness all around.This may seem obvious, but it you are already an Alexa user, this may be the best smart plug to get simply because it integrates so easily with Alexa.  It's really nice not to have to install another app on my phone for a different brand of smart plug and then link that app to Alexa -- eliminating that extra layer of complexity means one less thing that can go wrong.Like other smart plugs, there is a single button on the side which allows you to turn the plug on and off manually.I have just a few complaints:- First, the plug itself is very large, especially compared with other smart plugs on the market; it projects over 2"" out from the wall and is over 3"" wide.  Surely Amazon can make these smaller?  Please?- Second, the plug is on the pricey side as smart plugs go.  $25 is steep for a single plug.

I was hoping that with their own ""made for Alexa"" smart plug, Amazon would hit a home run in the home automation space.  However, I've been disappointed with the Amazon Smart Plug.While setup is supposed to be ""plug-and-play"" with the Alexa app handling all the heavy lifting, I found both of the Smart Plugs I purchased had problems connecting and I had to (repeatedly) go through a manual pairing and configuration process.Connectivity has been marginal, as both plugs occasionally lose connectivity and require power-cycling to restore communication. This is despite the fact that I have a mesh network in my home with terrific coverage, as well as 9 Alexa devices. So no matter how the Smart Plug needs to communicate with Alexa, my infrastructure shouldn't be a problem.Reliability in operation is problematic, too, as Alexa frequently and unpredictably informs me that she can't turn on one of the Smart Plugs right now, and to try again later.  Frustrating!Finally, there's no compatibility with home automation apps like SmartThings or Stringify, and the Echo app doesn't provide basic capability such as the ability to turn on a plug/light at sunset or off at sunrise.Overall, a disappointing purchase.  Hopefully a Gen 2 Smart Plug will offer more compelling capabilities and performance.  If you're looking for an Alexa-compatible smart plug today, however, there's definitely NO advantage purchasing this one.",Disappointing,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,710 people found this helpful,775,29,162215,Public

First of all, I HATED the app because adding a plug was so cumbersome. Plus, one of the plugs never did show up on the app so I couldn't really control it. It was in a room upstairs and I thought it must have been out of range of my WiFi router. I do not have a WiFi extender and almost bought one due to this issue. Had to send those plugs back.I was excited to see Amazon was coming out with their own smart plugs and pre-ordered them right away. Controlling everything through one app is way preferable. As a huge bonus, my upstairs plug that I previously could not control with the WeMo plug and app now works flawlessly with the Amazon plug and Alexa app. I guess it wasn't out of range after all.Pros:1. if you're already tied into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem this just makes sense, and you keep things under control with a single app. And easily controlled with your Echo device if you wish.2. Really easy to add a plug via the Alexa app. Alexa will recognize it right away and you just scan the back of the plug to add it.3. Shorter and less bulky than the WeMo plug.4. Smart plugs that may have been non-responsive on my network before are working flawlessly now with the Amazon plug in use instead.Cons:1. A bit pricey. I wish they offered multi-packs for a lower price per unit. This will probably happen later.2. Adding a plug to operate on an on/off schedule was NOT as easy as with WeMo. It took too many steps, was not straightforward, and should be more streamlined. Basically, you're creating what they call a ""routine."" You have to add a start time. Then go back and do it all over again to add an end time. So I had to create two routines to get my coffee maker to start on weekdays at 6:45am and turn off on weekdays at 7:45am. That was silly. I did eventually figure it out, but they should really work on making it involve less steps and be more intuitive.I will buy more but will wait until the price comes down or they're on sale.",works perfectly,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,686 people found this helpful,789,38,355053,Public

I’ve used it for awhile now and here are my experiences.  The plug was not as easy as described to setup.  It was not as plug n play as Amazon indicates.  I agree with most that it is pretty bulky, more so than I figured Amazon could design.Only supporting 2.4GHz Wi-Fi has been pretty standard, though you’d think Amazon has the resources to develop a 5GHz model (as well as a smaller footprint).  And I’ve experienced several brief ‘glitches’ where the Alexa app could not manage the plug.  If that is a typical issue then this is unacceptable.  I’ve expected better performance on this product given Amazon’s resources and entering the smart plug business late in the game.And then there’s the price.  I think this unit is overpriced regardless of the issues I’ve mentioned.  Being a long time customer and often a fan of Amazon, I expect them to be able to do better on size, performance and value.  This product, as is, is not innovative.  Make it smaller, stable, support 5GHz, and lower the cost.  Also consider lowering the cost further on multi-packs.  If customers like this product they will likely buy multiple.  Right now, the competitors are still as good.Having said all that, the plug does generally work, with the drawbacks listed, and I would likely buy additional units if Amazon lowers the price.  As it is I don’t see any advantages to this product over certain other manufacturers, at present.  I’m hoping that these plugs show up as Black Friday deals and will be looking out for them.  Though the release so close to a holiday, and I suspect low startup stock levels may preclude these items from BF deals.","Generally works, with issues, not innovative and has a high price point",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,125 people found this helpful,940,201,12458,Public

I bought the smart plug to pair it with Echo dot, and both of them see to work smoothly. Once the smart plug was paired with Echo dot, it works like a charm. I can issue voice commands to Alexa and the plug works as expected.This plug is aesthetically pleasing with rounded corners. The manual power switch for the plug is installed as a small dimple in the side which doesn't protrude out sits flush with rest of the body. This plug is wide but not tall, because which it doesn't block the sockets next to it on the wall plates. When the plug is turned on or off, it makes a small clicking noise, that is probably the sound of internal relay opening or closing the connection.This looks like a well-built plug and works reliably, with rare instances of not working and when I asked Echo dot to turn on the plug it would tell me that the plug is not responding. In such instance, I asked Alexa to turn the plug off (even though it was already off,) and then asked it again to turn it on. That seemed to fix the issue. However, if your switch seems to be unresponsive then I would recommend resetting the plug by removing the plug from socket and wait for 10 seconds. Then press and hold the power button on the plug. And while holding the button, plug into an outlet. After this step, try to pair the device again with the Alexa app.There is a small LED in the front which doesn't light up when the switch is off and turns to blue when the plug is turned on. If there are any issues with the plug or when the plug is initializing (after being plugged in), the LED turns to orange.By default, Alexa adds the smart plug as ""First plug"". The name of the plug can be changed in Alexa app (shown in the Video of my review)SETUPWith Echo dotThe setup with echo dot was extremely simple. As soon as I plugged in the Smartplug, Echo dot recognized the plug and responded that it has recognized the ""first plug"".Without Echo dot or if Echo dot cannot detect the smart plugI have shown how the setup process works in my video review.1. First, put the plug into pairing/discovery mode by pressing the power button on the side of the plug until the LED in the front starts blinking between blue and orange.2. After that open the Alexa app, and add a new device of type ""plug"". Plug type is Amazon.3. Alexa App will try to connect to the plug. At this step, we have two options. Either scan a QR code that comes with the plug (it is also printed on the plug as well.) If scanning the QR code is not possible then the app can also try to connect to the plug with Bluetooth.4. Once the App connects to the plug, it configures the plug for Wifi by asking you to select the Wireless network. After this step, the setup is done.OPERATING THE PLUGWith Echo dotWith echo dot I can simply say ""Alexa, turn on first plug"" and it turns on the plug. After I changed the name of plug to ""Christmas tree"" in the Alexa app, I could simply say ""Alexa, turn on christmas tree""ManuallyThere is a switch on the side of the plug as well which you can use to manually turn on/off the plug. The switch gives a tactile feedback when you use it.THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PLUG1. This plug supports current up to 15 Amperes, which is good enough for most of the appliances.2. Alexa adds the plug as ""First plug"" by default. But you can change the name of the plug in the app.3. This plug doesn't remember the state it was in if you remove it from the socket. If you remove the plug from the switch while this was on and plug it back in, the plug will be turned off. I think this might be because of safety issues and I prefer this behavior.",Works like a charm with Echo dot,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,46 people found this helpful,4664,86,4281,Public

I had a not-terribly-old (<2 years) dual-band router.  The setup for the plug through Alexa was painless....or so it seemed.  The plug would never hold a WiFi signal.  None of my timed routines worked.  Every time I came home, the plug was blinking red because it had lost the WiFi signal, and attempting to control it via Alexa I would get ""Device is unresponsive.""I read various articles on this problem, all of which seemed to involved unplugging/resetting my router repeatedly...which is stupid, since my router is working perfectly well with every other WiFi device in my home (a phone, two tablets, and two Rokus), and having to reset my router repeatedly is also not an actual solution; it's what tech support tells people when they want to get rid of them. Others had me going in and changing my firewall/port settings, or having to assign static IP addresses to the plugs, which I refused to do out of principle.  I can accomplish these tasks, but these devices are supposed to be made for your average home user who thinks a ""port"" is a place to dock a ship, and has never heard of ""DHCP"" or a ""static IP address.""  If it requires going into your router settings just to get a plug that turns off and on at set intervals, that's a poorly-made device.But, I had been meaning to upgrade my router, so on the off-chance the problem was with the router, I bought a brand-new one, with automatic band-switching between 2.4 and 5.0 GHz networks.  I once again went through the setup process...and the plug literally lost the WiFi signal within 5 minutes of being setup. ""Device is unresponsive.""It's not a question of reception -- the plug is no more than 15 feet away from the router, in direct line of sight, with no walls between it.

I thought simple setup with the alexa app would be easier than account linking with Kasa (what I primarily use) or WeMo (what my brother uses).I could not have been more wrong.My parents each have Fire HDX tablets, how was I to know that the most recent Alexa app in the Amazon app store for those tables would be from 2014?  The operating system was updated in September 2018 but the Alexa app is from November 2014.  That's four years old!!!  That ancient app has no devices tab, and cannot install Amazon smart plugs.So, tried Mom's phone. The Alexa app required my mother to put in a captcha which took multiple tries and finally the help of my son. Then the app failed completely with bluetooth detecting the plugs. It always failed the first wifi attempt as well, which I learned to recognize by watching for the wifi icon to turn off and back on (which is required to switch networks). Sometimes it failed wifi detection multiple times. ""May take up to 1 minute.""  Ha ha! How about up to 3 minutes each time?It took 5 or more tries to get the first outlet to reach the point where I could select the wifi network to attach. And it took multiple tries at that point before it would successfully connect to the network instead of failing as soon as I tapped continue after entering my password. Hint to amazon: your multi-digit failure codes need some explanation, assuming there is anything I can do to possibly make the next attempt succeed.Hint to anyone else struggling at that point: I suspect timeout entering a complex WiFi key. Enter the key elsewhere, e.g. a text message and copy it into the paste buffer so you can just paste it into Alexa app when prompted.Finally after over 2 hours, I have 2 plugs controllable from Echo and the Alexa app.I suspect bugs in the Alexa app, perhaps compounded by my Mom's LG phone. I have done literally dozens of Kasa devices and even more generic chinese ""smart life"" aka Jinvoo aka Tuya devices with WiFi setup on my phone and with my Fire tablet. Nothing has caused the pain and frustration of these Amazon smart plugs.Notes to Amazon: Update the Alexa app in your App Store for your own tablets. Please!

It literally takes less than 2 minute to add the plug to your network on which Alexa is on by using your Alexa app.  You can also name it to your liking and Alexa recognizes that plug according to that name.  For example, if you plug in your nightlight into the smart plug and custom name it, ""My Light Stand"", then Alexa will recognized that plug as ""My Light Stand"".  The app also lets you categorize what kind of device is plugged into the smart plug, such as lights.  The reason for giving 4 stars is that even if you connect the plug and categorize it as ""light"", you cannot dim it by voice control - you have to do it yourself using the remote control to that device.  It may be nicer if one can associate what product is connected to the smart plug and amazon can extend the function of that plugged in product, like dimming or switching to different colors, rather than just turning on and off the device.",Simple to add to your Smart Home network,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,14 people found this helpful,166,108,232277,Public

Pretty cheap plug -- certainly cheaper than the competition.  I wanted to replace my defective Wemo with this Amazon Smart Plug in hopes of turning my coffee maker on at a set time every morning.Installation was pretty straight-forward.  I simply opened the Alexa app and it discovered the plug right away.  You can also just go to DEVICES on the app and add the plug.The plug works perfectly!  My coffee maker turns on at a set time.

Under ADD ACTION go to SMART HOME -> ALL DEVICES -> and select your newly named plug. Click NEXT9.

I am a tech geek and I had to go on the Internet and find instructions on how to set this up.Of course, you can tell Alexa to turn on or off your device as it is now integrated with Echo systems.The plug is very well built.  It works extremely well.  I am surprised that Amazon priced it so affordably.  If you can put up with the more difficult process of setting up a routine, I would recommend this over the Wemo.

When they work. You can get two in most outlets, over/under kinda thing, if you have to. They work with alexa without a third party app. Simple enough idea. Hey alexa, turn on the light. Turn off the fan. etc. Great. BUT... I've ordered three of these and two of them needed to be returned for replacement. They won't set up. I asked alexa to find the new device. She didn't. I went to the web page and clicked ""discover"" new device. It didn't. I used the app on my Kindle Fire tablet. It couldn't read the QR code and couldn't set it up by looking for it. This has happened on two of the three I've bought. I contacted support both times assuming they would think of something I didn't. But both times it was necessary to send me a replacement. Both times I got the replacement to work and when they work they're great. Some observations: Initially, just plug it in and activate whatever system you're going to use for set up. It will blink a blue light. If the app fails to read the QR code, then hit the button to make it blink blue and red. I tried three different outlets with the two different light color options and it wasn't ""discovered"". Be advised that there is a ""reset"" mode on these plugs. Press and hold the button for 12 seconds. I didn't know that. It didn't help in my case but good to know.Be aware that in some places a smart plug is a ""device"" and in other instances a ""device"" is only an Echo, Dot, and other Amazon things, not a smart plug.Be aware that they, for some reason, call the QR code a bar code. Bar codes are what they scan at the grocery store. The square one is a QR code so don't waste your time looking for a bar code.It would be nice if all ways to set it up, (vocally through alexa, the web page on a laptop, an app on a phone or tablet, etc), were all set up the same way and used the same terminology. It makes these more difficult to set up when icons are in different places, on different pages or called different things.I like these plugs when they work. I now have three that control different lights etc that are inconvenient to reach. I just ask alexa! They're expensive at 25 bucks each but it is possible to catch them on sale. That's the only time I get one.Jan 2020 update....after a month this last (third) plug stopped responding. I tried re-discovering it myself. Setting it up again, etc. I contacted tech support and they walked me through several different processes to get it set up anew. Different blinking light colors, by voice, by QR code, etc . Tech support finally conceded defeat and they are sending me yet another one. I don't think I will be buying this brand again. I love not needing a third party app/account etc just to use alexa but apparently amazon does not have their act together when it comes to these smart plugs.April 24 2020 update.... another one stopped working. Since its already ""in the system"" it can't be discovered or set up. There is no ""re-discover"" option for when these things quit. The serial number is on the plug and its box but not the paper with the QR code so keep them together or write on the paper which plug it goes to. You can disable it but not delete it. I thought if I deleted it and then added it anew that would work. Due to quarantine most help is unavailable now. ****Was able to to phone customer support the next day. After 45 minutes we got it working again. They had to un-register it so that it was a ""new"" device. Then the system (in my case a fire tablet) was able to set it up again. These really should be easier to trouble shoot on the user end. A rediscover option or something. Having alexa tell you ""the light is not responding"" doesn't help. What do I do now???****Bottom line... DON'T BUY THESE. the lack of reliability/quality far out weighs any benefits.May30th 2020... AGAIN third plug is unresponsive. Nothing I do can get it to reset. Unplugging re-plugging. Flashing colored lights. QR codes or discovery. Will have to call CS when calling is available. These plugs suck.!!June 4th 2020... CS is sending me another one. You can delete the device from its app page but apparently that's not enough to make it new again. Deleting it did allow me to get further into the setup process but in the end, still unresponsive.

As the X-10 devices have aged, some have become unreliable.  They turn themselves on when they feel like it.  Others turn on but won't turn off when you push the button.  Twenty minutes later they turn off as directed.  Frustrating, but they are pretty old, after all.So I figure perhaps it's time to upgrade to one of the voice activated switches/plugs.  Being heavily invested in Kindles (7), Echos (9), and Dots (5), it seemed like a ""no brainer"" to go with the Alexa operated plugs.  So I settled on the Amazon Smart Plug.  I now have 38 such plugs.  In theory and operation (mostly) the Amazon Smart Plugs work as desired.  No more random turn-on's, or failure to shut off, as with the ancient X-10's.HOWEVER, and this is a BIG however.  Seven or eight Amazon Smart Plugs, for no reason I can figure out, have disconnected themselves from the Wi-Fi or Internet.  Alexa announces it can't find the plugs, or no such device exists.  The Alexa app says the plug is ""unresponsive.""  Huh?  More than a half dozen plugs are no longer available?  After a LOT of frustration (all these plugs are physically located in hard to reach places requiring furniture to be moved and other things unplugged and moved), the plug can be retrieved.  I've found the only way to reset and use the plugs again, is first DELETE the existing plug in the Alexa app (trash can in the upper right corner) then go through the complete set-up process like when the plug was first set up.  I don't have a bar code scanner so the button on the side of the plug must be pushed and held until the light flashes red then blue and continues until the setup progresses.  This DOES WORK.  The plug is now usable again.  (Until the next time?)  Now go back on the floor and reconnect everything and move the furniture back in place.  So why did the plug lose it's ""connectivity"" with Alexa?  For $25 apiece, I kinda expected better from Amazon.  Not frustration every couple of days.Another irritation.  In my case the Internet (Windstream) went down for over 12 hours this past weekend.  It seems the smart plugs turn dumb as a brick when there is no Internet.  I guess the ID information for each individual plug must be stored on the Internet, and Alexa must communicate with the ""cloud"" to complete the Smart Plug usage.  Thus--no Internet, no Smart Plug operation.  Yes--IF you can reach the location of the Smart Plug on the wall, you can manually press the side button and turn ""on"" the plug.  But in my case, the plug turned itself off, after 8 to 10 minutes.  Was this a fluke?  Dunno.When these Smart Plugs work, they are wonderful.  But life living with them CAN become frustrating.  Be prepared.  Good luck, RIC",Sometimes they have a mind of their own,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,135,141,192687,Public

It's great when it works?  I preordered one of these plugs to try when it came out.  I've had the plug for less than three weeks and it has become unresponsive three times, forcing me to delete it and re-add in Alexa.  THEN, I have to re-add the couple of routines I set up for it...Alexa remembers the time settings but not what is supposed to happen.  Also...the Alexa app is ponderous and aggravating as to how it handles scheduling of activities.  There seems to be a different screen for each step.  Why can't the steps be reduced to one or two screens....and it's slow.  I found the Meross and Tuya apps to be more user friendly, and the plugs don't give me issues.  I might return the Amazon plug.Update - 11.01.2018:  Amazon apparently pays attention to these reviews.  To their credit, I received a call from Amazon yesterday, inquiring about the problem I was having with the smart plug, stating that they were going to replace it immediately and that I would be contacted by their Labs to arrange for the return of the problem unit for analysis.  I have been informed that my new plug will be arriving tomorrow and have, indeed, been contacted by the Lab to arrange for the first one's return.  Based on this level of attention to customer satisfaction, I'm bumping up my rating to three stars and might go higher if the new unit does not give me any issues.  Thank you for your attention, Amazon.Update - 11.14.2018:  Thank you for trying, Amazon.  I installed the replacement plug you sent on 11/03.  Now it's the 14th, less than two weeks, and it has become unresponsive, too, for no apparent reason.  I'm sorry, but I don't want to spend the time dealing with it and I don't like the idea of worrying about when it's going to give out again if I do.  I'll be sending it back.

That or at least being more reliable and straightforward.Turns out this was not the case, as explained below.PROS:- Compact, space saving design. You're able to fit 2 of these in a regular outlet.CONS:- Pricey, compared to most of the competition (although you can find them for lower prices in deals and bundles).- The button for manually turning it on and off is very small and recessed. That makes it harder to press if under a table, behind a desk; etc.- The setup process is not very intuitive and sometimes troublesome. The instructions are not very clear (keep in mind I'm a tech-lover and setup new products often).- They don't offer local network controls when the internet is down, like most of the competitors do; and,most importantly...***- THEY TURN OFF AFTER 7-10 MINUTES OF BEING DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET!***Now, everything else is tolerable: The price becomes very good when there's a deal or a bundle, the setup process is frustrating, but usually done only once, most of us will control them by voice so the button will be rarely used, and the internet is usually up most of the time so local network control is not a necessity all of the time for most.What is not tolerable to me is that these plugs are NOT reliable because the TURN OFF on their own when they lose connection to the internet. Even when still connected to the WiFi, if you internet is down, they turn off after about 7 to 10 minutes of losing connection.If you turn them on again manually (using the button), guess what? THEY WILL TURN OFF AGAIN AFTER ANOTHER 7-10 MINUTES!!!I have found many users online who have this issue but no one has come up with a solution.All other smart plug brands I've used are capable of maintaining their current state when they become disconnected. Even after a power outage, they maintain their power state (on or off) when the electricity comes back. Some even let you choose in the settings if you want them to stay off or turn back on after an outage, whatever the previous state was.This Amazon Plug doesn't let you do any of this and it is VERY frustrating that it just gives up and turns off.I have 1 in my office, in the company building where I work for turning my desk (lamp, monitors, fan; etc) off when I leave for a meeting, bathroom; etc.Sometimes due to network bottlenecks or server maintenance, the internet will be down for a while. This will TURN OFF MY COMPUTER MONITORS EVERY 7 MINUTES, even after turning the smart plug on manually. I just end up unplugging the smart plug and just directly plugging my desk's power strip to the wall. This doesn't happen because of an overload as I measured the current to be way under the 15 amp limit. And it only happens when there's no internet.Similarly, at home, I have another one connected only to a Wyze Cam (great cameras, by the way), so I would be able to reboot that camera remotely if needed. Every once in a while I would find that the camera is offline because the Amazon Plug turned off on its own.CONCLUSION:The inability of the plug to remain powered on makes it useless for my purposes. Having said that, if you need a smart plug and you have a 100% reliable 24/7 internet connection, then this becomes an option. Specially if you can manage to buy it in a bundle (for as low as $5 sometimes when bought with an Echo).Otherwise, I would recommend you buy another brand that offers more functionality and reliability, like TP-Link Kasa Mini/Lite plugs (which I have also found to have some issues as well in some network configurations), or brands that use the Smart Life app.Hope this was helpful.Happy shopping.",THEY TURN OFF AFTER 7-10 MINUTES OF BEING DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET!,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,10,3,62593673,Public

Tellingly, Amazon doesn't bundle 2 smart plugs for a discounted rate; instead, they bundle other 'smart' devices with a single plug.Just how useful IS a smart plug? From what I can see, it'll be useful only with items that use a two-position mechanical switch - on or off, like non-dimmable lights, or a simple coffee maker. I intended to use it with a floor lamp with an inconveniently located mechanical switch, but now that I'm looking closer, I see that Philips Hue is offering a 4-pack of Echo-compatible, dimmable 60-w bulbs for $40. That seems to be a much better option that the $20 for the smart plug that is only on/off, especially since I already have the bridge unit for smart lights.

I plugged the device into a power strip and use it for my computer charger so it doesn't overcharge my laptop. I don't know if they've made improvements, but connection worked out great so I've upgraded my review from 3 stars to 5 stars.Thoughts:1. I wanted to try using this as a plug for a power strip, but it doesn't work because there must be some safety feature.2. If the Echo/Alexa has trouble finding your plug, don't panic. There is a button on the side of the device that you can press for the light to flash and for the plug to be ""discoverable"".3. The plugs are named in chronological order (ie. First plug, second plug, etc.) and you can't edit the names though you can group devices on your Alexa app. So keep track of which plug is which.4. Again, I don't believe that this device should be used for life saving equipment as it is dependent on your wifi connection and Echo/Alexa adds an additional command step to the sequence of using a machine.I would recommend this product!Previous Review:I waited to review this plug because I wanted to try it out with different devices and at different distances from both Echo/-Dot and my modem.Devices: I tried the plug with a space heater and with a laptop (to avoid overcharging). I plugged it into a power strip with no problem, but do note if you're using a space heater with an automatic shut off, the plug is going to be shut off just like the rest and you have to turn on the strip and then tell Echo to turn on the plug separately. I've decided that the automatic shut off is enough of a safety feature and the Smart Plug is best used for devices that are capable of utilizing a continuous stream of electricity without emergently overloading and need the plug to monitor the usage (e.g. a laptop). ***Please take note of my exception at the bottom of the review!Now for the big item issue: Connectivity.I believe the key is that your Wifi connection needs to be optimized to get the most out of this plug. If you have slightly unreliable wifi (e.g. I live out in the country with plenty of winter storms), plug the smart plug closer to your modem and minimize the distance from your Alexa. I don't know if this is a must, but it worked for me. If your internet shorts out in, you don't have to re-setup the plug, but the plug lights might get thrown off for a bit (it will stay red even when it's on and flash blue at random points). Ignore that. If your Echo/-dot is flashing red as well, the plug is going to be down.Just give the Wifi a second to settle down and you should be set to go. The irritating part is that the Echo resyncs with the Wifi much faster than the plug. I tried to reset it up/give it time and it took hours for it to sync up again, but maybe that was because it was further away from the Echo/modem. Either way, just know that once your wifi has been signed in, as long as you haven't changed the password, your sign in is set.Other reviewers are correct: the set up instructions are easy to overlook. Either have the instructions next to you so you have the set up password or be near an outlet.1. You go into your Alexa app2. The top left corner has the three lines3. Click on add a device4. Choose plug5. Brand is Amazon,6. Click ""Next"" to agree to the conditions of use and terms7. Scan the barcode on the back of the plug or from the instructions (You have to get the little box with squiggly lines to be lined up in the sights of the screen) and then follow the instructions. It's okay if you have to unplug the smart plug for a second to scan the 2D barcode, just plug it back in quickly.8. It will tell you to press the button on the side till the lights flash red and blue (keep pressing till that happens) and then make sure to follow the instructions for signing into your Wifi.***IMPORTANT and MY OPINION: I really wouldn't recommend that you use this plug for life-saving/emergency equipment even if you think that you have the best Wifi in the world. A plug with a timer or any regular plug is reliant on electricity, but, as aforementioned, this plug requires an extra step of being turned on by Echo/-Dot. If your electricity goes out momentarily, you lose the time waiting for the lights to turn back on, but with the plug you have to additionally ask for Echo to turn the plug back on and/or resync with your wifi.",Useful and Upgraded (Edited Note),Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,492,136,38264,Public

The power went off in my house for just a couple of minutes this morning.  Three of these plugs forgot that they were in the ""ON"" state when the power went off.  When the power came back on they decided to be ""OFF.""  This is not acceptable to me.These plugs do not require a hub and in fact CANNOT be used with a hub.  That's too bad because there is no way to get around the limitations (so far) with the software controlling the plugs.  I switched from an IRIS smart home system to these plugs.  Amazon smart plugs have only rudimentary functionality.Pros:  Easy initial pairing setup.  Fast response time when given a command. No hub required.  Pretty reliable.Cons:  Setting up routines to turn lamps on and off on a schedule is a bit cryptic until you've done it a few times.  More problematic is that there is NO WAY TO LABEL A ROUTINE for a particular device.  So if you have 10 devices, each with routines for start and stop times, you are left with a page of on and off times that are not organized in any way.  It makes it difficult to change the on and off time of a particular device without hunting through the page for the on time and then the off time for plug you want to change.  Lastly, there is NO SETTING THAT AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTS ON-OFF TIMES FOR SUNRISE OR SUNSET.  With the (now defunct) IRIS smart home, I could set a lamp to come on 30 minutes before sunrise and turn off 1 hour past sunrise.  Or I could have a plug turn on 1 hour before sunset and turn off 3 hours after sunset.  So the plugs would automatically adjust to the changing sunrise and sunset times over the course of a year.  This is NOT possible with the Amazon smart plug.If Amazon would address those two issue (labeling routines and the ability to set times based on sunrise and sunset) these would be world class smart plugs.  Of course the ability to control these plugs with a smart hub (if desired) would be a bonus.  Right now, these plugs are pretty stupid.  They perform only very basic functions.",Easy set up but only rudimentary abilities,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,98,34,1773254,Public

This is a 16x14 room that is dim even in natural light. The room has no overhead lighting, so I depend on lamps for lighting. I am in and out of the room frequently throughout the day and evening and often have my arms full. Repeatedly turning the lamps on and off (vs. just toggling a light switch with an elbow if necessary) as I entered and left the room was a major hassle. Before I got the smart plugs  I typically just left a lamp on in the room after dark so that I didn't trip on something before I reached a lamp to turn it on.The smart plugs have solved the problem. I just tell Alexa to turn on/off plug 1 or plug 2 as I enter or leave the room to accomplish the task hands-free. I instantly have just the amount of light I need when I need it and am not burning electricity when I don't.The plugs are not inexpensive but is was a cost effective investment for me vs. paying an electrician to change out my ceiling fan for a overhead light fixture controlled by a light switch on the wall (a light kit for the existing fan isn't an option).  I already had the Echo Dot but you could control the lamps with the Alexa app on your phone, tablet, etc.An added bonus: When I'm falling asleep the slightest movement can stimulate me back into wakefulness, so I LOVE being able to simply ask Alexa to turn off the lamps just as I'm falling asleep.I tried cheaper smart plugs that I ordered off Amazon and they connected with my wireless but Alexa kept saying the plugs were unresponsive.

It turns out my issue was with our profiles, not the plug. There is a lot happening behind the scenes with the Alexa smart home. I had to add the device to my wife’s account instead of mine and everything works fine now with voice control.Of note, I got a call from Amazon after I submitted the initial review to help me troubleshoot my issue. I hadn’t contacted them yet so this proves they do read these reviews. I had already got it up and running by the time they called though and they weren’t sure why my fix seemed to work because all of my other Alexa devices are registered to my account and profile. In the end, they said if it works just go with it so that’s what I’m doing.Positives: Amazon product easily integrates with Amazon smart home (when set up properly), easy setup and excellent Amazon customer service.Negatives: No dimming, no HomeKit compatibility (or Google, etc). Pricey for what you get.For me, having Lutron Caseta products in my home, with the requisite hub, their plugs have many more features I use at the same price point.Initial Review:Tried one of these out to compare to the Lutron Caseta ones since I only need one more for my application. Setup was a breeze, instructions are in the box and Alexa app easily found it and added it to my long list of devices. The only problem is that Alexa can't find the device when asked via Echo. I can go to the Alexa app, find it in my devices and turn it on or off all I want, but when I use voice control no dice. I'll talk to Amazon Customer Service to see what they suggest. Perhaps I have a bad plug, who knows. If I can get it sorted out, I may update my rating because most other people are having no problems.By the way, the Caseta smart plugs allow you to dim the lights. If you have Caseta in your home, it's probably worth it to go with their smart plugs if you want dimming. Price wise, they are the same per unit, but the Caseta only comes in a two pack.","Updated review- Works with app, not with voice.",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,514,53,827165,Public

This product is fatally flawed. DO NOT BUY IT ! If your ISP interrupts service or your WiFi router drops the signal. These plugs drop off the network and have to be reinitiallized. The result is if you have a critical device plugged in to one that device WILL NOT WORK until you go thru the whole paring process from step 1.  I have one in direct line of sight of my Alexa + my network dropped out and the plug failed fatally. These plugs dial home to amazon and report every activation so if they can’t dial home the don’t fail safe - they fail fatal. BAD amazon!  Amazon with a new software mod and Fix this so they work  on Zwave without dialing home.  So one can plug in and pair these with Alexa plus. So again these Do Not Work !  They work for a few days BUT then Alexa+ looses com with them and no amount of asking Alexa to discover devices works to restore their function. Something is very wrong with the software that runs these plugs. In contrast my philips hue bulbs always work and never loose com.

I am actually going to make this review more streamlined as these aren’t much different then the TP Link plugs I reviewed. The reason why I purchased these: The first reason was the price, when they are not on sale, they are comparable to the price of other plugs on the market including Amazon but on sale, they were roughly 30% cheaper than the TP Link plugs I purchased  at their regular price.  The second reason is because I have five Echo dots around the house and although I can use the Echo Dot to communicate with the TP link plug, I can’t ask the Echo Dot if the plug is on or off like I can using TP Link plugs with  Google home,  so I figured if I have an Amazon plug and an Amazon smart speaker they should communicate better. The third reason is because these plugs can handle 15 A like the more expensive plugs, and although most of my devices are 10 A or less, I like the ability to use these with nearly every device in the house. The last reason is because the reviews I read about how easy these were to set up and I was looking forward to the set up process because of how  effortless the Echo Dot third generation smart speakers were to set up. My experience with Amazon plugs: Setting up my first plug was not as simple as it should have been. I tried scanning the back of the plug and when that didn’t work I then tried to scan the barcode on the instruction sheet.  when that didn’t work I turn on the overhead lights, and when that didn’t work then I  held down the button on the side of the plug until the blue and red lights appeared.  My phone then found the plug and I chose my network to connect with and it said this may take up to one minute. Two minutes later I got an error message.  I tried the process about 10 times over before I finally gave up.  Later on last night when I decided to try the process again, I then found the unnamed plug as one of my devices and I was finally able to use it. I figured this had to be a fluke but when I went to set up my second plug today, the process was exactly the same. The barcode not scanning, not being able to connect it to my Wi-Fi and then later on finding it as one of my devices. The other thing I learned is the echo dot cannot communicate with the Amazon plug like google home can communicate with TP Link, meaning I can’t ask if the device is already on. So far I am not disappointed with the Amazon plugs but I am not thrilled with the features.  The benefit of buying Amazon plugs is the price, nothing more. If you are patient and can troubleshoot then these plugs are worth the cheaper price, however if you are not tech savvy, if you get frustrated with repeating  steps and waiting, then from my experience I could not recommend these.  I think using my father is the best example,  The VCR always flashed at 12, you could not record anything unless you were home to press the record button until my brother and I got old enough to figure out how to program it ourselves,  and now that we are moved out, the clapper is the most advanced device in their house that he can properly use  on a regular basis, and the question is, could I give this plug to him to figure out how to use it, with the Echo Dot, yes, but it would either wait on the counter until  I set it up for my parents, or it would be in the trashcan in several hundred pieces  after he tried to set it up. By the way, I  was using an iPhone X with the most current iOS  software.",I honestly can’t recommend these two other customers until the set up process is fixed.,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,147,31,678965,Public

I have a radiant oil heater and a fan on a TP-LINK plug that would kick on when the temperature dropped below 50°s outside and off when above 50°s using IFTTT, but I wanted to be able to activate the fan separately. Well I left the heater on the TP-LINK plug since the applet is already set and I went to setup a different one for the fan with the Amazon plug. Turns out the only Amazon widget in the list is the cloud drive.I don't know why Amazon doesn't release a widget to control all devices in your Alexa interface, but it seems this is going to be another situation like Prime Video on Android devices and take years just to get them to cave. For the time being, invest in devices from other manufacturers that aren't so lazy. I like TP-LINK well enough but maybe wait for a sale, their app interface is nice and they have lots of options like setting timers, logging usage stats, and long term scheduling.","If you like automation, don't buy these plugs.",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,17,33,3846823,Public

Amazon had Smart Plugs on sale for a fantastic price, so we bought one to try out. Our Smart Plug worked 1.5 times before Alexa could never find the lamp to turn on.The initial setup was fairly easy, since Amazon emailed me with clear instructions. Initially this worked; for one time we could tell Alexa to turn on and turn off our bedroom lamp. The second time, Alexa turned on the lamp, but when I woke up, the lamp was off. After that, the Smart Plug would not stay online, it would display a steady red light instead of a blue one. We had to keep re-setting and re-synchronizing our lamp with Alexa but it wouldn't work. It got to a point where the blue and red light kept blinking all the time. Whenever I tried to set up Smart Plug up again, I would get to the blinking blue light, indicating it was setting up. But I never did get a steady blue light again after several attempts. So we felt it best to return it.While this is a super idea, this first generation of Smart Plugs need more work--still too many bugs for it to work on a consistent basis.

I wasted about a week just to know on the last day that I can't get the 24 credits back. First time I had any big problems with Amazon as well, and I know that my message will probably be seen by few, but good luck everyone.Product itself isn't bad it gets the job done but the price doesn't make sense. At the time I'm writing this it costs $24.99 which is steep compared to its competitors who offer 4 outlets for roughly the same price as one of these. (Why would you get this 1 for 25 if you can get 4?) But that's not the point, point is other people are having this problem as well so just be aware.[IF] you see the deal on your homepage stating that it's 0.99 (after spending 24.99 you will receive 24 back for connecting your smart plug to Alexa) don't get it unless you want to waste your time. I've spent a couple of days talking to customer support for nothing. I received my order on August 26 and it's currently September 1.First day, I connected it and didn't know when I would get the credit so I didn't do anything. Later that day I remembered that I had a 5 dollar credit from before and it automatically applied onto a purchase. So I decided to see if the same would apply with something random (to see if the credit has been applied, I didn't actually get it I just got to the confirmation screen). Nothing was there and from there I believe I contacted customer support that day or the day after (or later but not the point), in any case, I switched between 3 agents, 1st saying that he was going to get me the agent who handles this, 2nd said the usual small talk and transferred me to the 3rd (said nothing just gave me a new agent), to the 3rd and final agent of the day. I was told that the code given in the package (on a piece of paper which you would scan to connect it to Alexa) couldn't provide me the money back (understandable) so I had to use the code on the back of my device. I scan it and the agent tells me that I would receive a email and the credits onto my amazon account within 24-48 hours. Sure enough I wait for a little over 50 hours and received nothing so once again I contact amazon customer support.Now keep in mind each one of these agents took a bit to respond which is understandable, people are busy, but shouldn't lie. It starts the same with the usual small talk and I was informed that the agent I contacted isn't able to help so I got help from another agent who finally told me that no code was ever applied to my account. It took roughly 40 minutes alone for this to complete by the way. I was most likely told that I didn't have a code roughly 10-20 minutes in.If anyone else saw this ad, I wish you luck on getting the 24 credits back and hopefully don't waste your time. (I get that its 25 bucks but still I wish I could've just gotten an answer the first day I contacted customer support, I mean seriously if you get me a agent that is supposed to be know what I need help with I can't get lied and have to waste my time!)(P.S) - Last agent told me that the leadership team would be notified and there will be coaching for the previous agents I dealt with, but who knows what will happen.",Customer service or what?,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,4,2,62593673,Public

The plugs were anything but easy to integrate with my eero mesh system. I spent over 3 hours (5 different c/s reps) on the phone with Amazon C/S trying to getting them to work. They were basically clueless. OK, at the end of 3 hours, the bottom line is that there is no way to get the eero (a dual band router) to work with these (2.4 GHz devices) according to Amazon C/S. They gave up and recommended that I call eero. I did. I spent 1 hour on the phone with eero and, after they shut off the 5 Ghz band, we still couldn't get the Amazon Smart Plugs to work. Nada! Nothing! Zip!Backstory - OK so I know that eero is somewhat problematic in working with 2.4 Ghz devices. I previously had the same problem with the HUGOAI Smart plugs and had spent 30 minutes with eero getting them back on line after an update. When it happened a 2nd time (following a firmware update), I was annoyed, and I thought I would upgrade to the Amazon plugs, based on what I read, and avoid this problem in the future. That was not to be. As I said above, the Amazon plugs didn't work. At all. No matter how hard we tried.NB: In that same session with the eero c/s rep (which is without a doubt the best c/s dept I have ever encountered) I decided to go back to the HUGOAI Smart Plugs. It took all of 5 minutes during the eero c/s managed 2.4 Ghz session to get 4 plugs back up and running. If HUGOAI can get their plugs to work with eero, why can't Amazon?As an aside, eero really needs to give customers the ability to disable the 5 Ghz band without having to call c/s. There are still so many devices (especially home automation) that only use the 2.4 Ghz band that it really is a necessity so that customers can avoid the inconvenience of having to call c/s (even if it is excellent and 24/7) to get devices to connect. Irrespective of this inconvenience, I am still a big eero fan.",Does NOT work with eero mesh system,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,473,177,79316,Public

Soon after got two Dots.  Was preparing to gradually ramp up the entire home to be ""Alexa"" enabled.  Rather than starting with switches and lights, I thought I would start with Amazon's own Smart Plugs.  Got the first two last week and they connected easily and quickly.  Named one for a Fan and another for Night Lights.  After that, I left them.  Tested On then Off and all was working.  A couple of hours later, Device Unresponsive for each.  During that time, I had ordered a third one thinking all was good.A day or two later, I re-added the two during the middle of the day.  All was working again.  When I got home from work, Device Unresponsive for each.Today, Saturday, I spent time with customer support.  I could not understand them well so they sent me to someone in the U.S.  We removed the devices again and added the first two.  All was working as expected.  I then added the third one on another floor and it, too, was working fine.  Set up a couple of routines for timed on and off.Went out for lunch and came home and was going to show how these work and Device Unresponsive for all three plugs.  This morning she told me to call back if they drop off so I did.  I got another difficult to understand person and he was starting to have me reset and do the same thing again.  I asked him to troubleshoot.  He said that is how they troubleshoot because the devices are too simple.  There is nothing else to do.  Not ONCE did anyone say, let's check the settings in the app.  Absolutely NO troubleshooting was done.  I had to explain that resetting the device and doing the same thing is not troubleshooting.  That is what he calls troubleshooting.He told me there was nothing else to do and was going to issue a refund.  I asked again if he would try to troubleshoot and he said there is nothing left to do.So far, my experience with Echo is that it's nothing more than a glorified music player.  Currently, that's all I can use it for and my phone did that just fine with bluetooth speakers before Echo came into my home.  The goal was that music would be the least Echo's in the house would do but instead it looks like that's all they can do.Customer service for these could not be worse.  The guy didn't even ask a single network question other than if it is a dual band network.  It is.  He asked me if it was 5G meaning 5Ghz and I explained that, yes, it is but I know the plugs only work on 2.4Ghz.  Yes, it's dual.  Yes 2.4Ghz is turned on.  That's why they connected in the first place.I would love to hear from a qualified person at Amazon who really knows what to do with these devices.  Hopefully before they are returned.  He was so quick to issue a refund.  I'd be willing to try something but no one offered anything to try but start over again.I have a dual band eero network which sounds like Amazon is about to buy.  I have great wifi coverage with the eero's in the home (7).  Nothing else drops off of the network - just these plugs.I'm sure it's too late to return the Echo's but I would at this point.

Note that the other smart plus and switches, even when they temporarily lose network connectivity, do NOT power down themselves or the devices they control -- they simply become temporarily unresponsive to commands mediated by Alexa. But that's tolerable because they all have other ways of being controlled which I can fall back on. (So does the Amazon Smart Plug -- it has a built-in switch.)

I bought these in October to replace a TP-LINK smart plug that eventually died on me. I figured that I'd give Amazon's official solution a shot, since I already used Alexa to control a heater and some lights. On occasion, the TP-LINK smart plug would stop responding to the point that I'd have to set it up again each time. For a while, the Amazon Smart Plug was doing the same thing, albeit much more often. It happened at least once a week, and I'd set it up again each time.A while back, it happened again, so I just unplugged it for a short time and plugged it back in. I haven't had an issue with it since. *knocks on wood* As such, I'm tentatively increasing my rating by one star, leaving it at two stars. Assuming that it continues to behave, I'll potentially continue that trend and increase my rating further. I don't know if it received a stealth firmware update or what, but it seems fine now.",The Amazon Smart Plug seems to have finally started behaving itself.

This is especially a problem if you control power to something remotely from your phone.Using this to control power to a wine cooler/beverage center fridge that I use as a fermentation chamber for my beer brewing. Went with this as opposed to other popular brands as I didn't want to have to create 3rd party web accounts then link them and all that hassle. Setup was a cinch and controlling on/off power to the fridge works perfectly. I've also checked and there's no unusual heat whatsoever from the smartplug, it's nice and ambient temperature to the touch. Also went with these so I could fit two vertically in the standard dual wall outlet. My firdge's max temp is 61F so for $25 it's a no brainer to be able to control on/off to my fermentation chamber with my voice and not have to keep pulling the plug out of the wall once fermentation slows and temps start dropping.",*EDIT - both plugs stopped working as of today 5/22!,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,332,62,577828,Public

I’m tired of managing too many apps and skills for various devices.  I want everything to be Amazon only.  That’s why I purchased the Cloud Cam and now why I’ve purchased the Amazon-branded Smart Plugs.The set up was easy; however, because our router uses Mac filtering, that was a bit of a pain.  As far as I can tell, the Plug, like the Cloud Cam, does not have an easily identifiable Mac Address.  For all my other devices (Echos, Fire tablets, Fire TVs), I can look in the Alexa app for that device’s settings, tap About, and see the Mac Address.  There is no Mac Address shown for the Plug.  What I had to do was temporarily disable Mac Filtering on my router (via the router settings), set up the Plug, then re-enable Mac Filtering.  I really don’t know how Mac Filtering works, but my router is allowing wi-fi access to the Plug.When I first set up the Plug, there were no specific instructions in the Alexa app.  I had to tap the Devices icon (looks like spoons in a house) in the lower right, then the + sign in the upper right.  I changed the device Type to a Light (from a Plug) because I have nightlights plugged into my Smart Plugs.  I also kept the names short because Alexa can get fussy and we can’t remember all the names.  We’ve got Kitchen Light, Dining Light, Den Light, etc.There was a message box about giving access to my location to my Smart Plug, lol.  I elected to Cancel that; not sure why my Smart Plug needs access to my location.So far, everything works great.  It’s a much better configuration than the motion-activated lights I previously had.  It’s a lot easier to manage a single app.  However, it’s just basic on/off.  It’s not possible to do themes, or dimming, or a sundown/sunset schedule.  That’s okay with me; I want simple.The only thing I don’t like is that the Plug is bigger than I expected.  It’s big, almost like a Twinkie.  I didn’t look at the dimensions before I purchased it; my bad.  It’s too wide for a Decora combo switch/outlet (see 2 attached photos).  It blocks the switch.Addendum:  I have five of these Amazon plugs.  Now that I’ve used them for a month, I notice they all frequently emit a super high-pitched eeeeeeee.  Sometimes it’s very noticeable within 4 feet or so of the plug, other times it’s not noticeable at all.  I still love the convenience of the plugs.Second addendum:  I’ve now twice had my internet service go down for a period of time.  When that happens, all the devices plugged into the Smart Plugs also go down.  In my case, I’ve got night lights on all my plugs.  So, if the internet goes down at night, the house goes completely dark.  Annoying.  I don’t view this as a Plug problem, but it’s a downside of relying on something (Alexa and the Smart Plugs) that relies on the internet.","Excellent device that works flawlessly with Alexa (don’t need any other app or skill, hurray!)",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,2132,491,598113,Public

However I was often engaged in something that prevented me from actually doing it right then.  So I'd intend to turn it on when I finished my project.  However, I would forget, and my poor plant would droop because it needed light.  So, I'd read about the smart plug but thought it would be complicated and require special wiring and what not.  Finally I tried it.  Voila, my plant gets light daily now because all I need to do is call to Alexa to turn on the plant light.  I am astonished that it took nothing more than to plug the smart plug into the outlet, follow the directions on the Alexa site and start using.

You COULD, but but plugging a light into it, it means you can basically never use your light switch traditionally again. Sometimes I dont want to use Alexa, so that was not an option for me. Once it shuts it off, the light switch is obviously not ever going to turn the lights on. I really thought about what I could plug into this that I would be ok with only using my voice to control, and the only thing I could find was our Christmas tree lights! So in the end of it all, its just seasonal. Still cool, but not sure what I am going to do with it once Christmas is over!Update *** we have moved, and since found more uses for it.

I have about 80 smart devices on my wifi network at home, dozens of them smart plugs like this.I've gone through all the setup types - connect to a temp wireless network on the device to set it up, have the device found via bluetooth, etc...I'll give Amazon this much - this was the EASIEST to set up.  Plugged it in, and that was it.  Before I had a chance to do anything else, my Echo Show in the great room told me it found and setup and named the plug, First Plug.So yeah, Amazon rocked it with that setup.  Then in the Alexa app I was able to rename it just fine.I've replaced a lot of the plugs as I tried to consolidate into the SmartLife app.  I was tired of having half a dozen programs and having to remember what devices were controlled by what apps.  Yes, they all worked with Alexa but sometimes I needed to do it via an app.  So if it's not SmartLife compatible I don't buy it now.  These only integrate directly into the Alexa app, so that's a downside to me.Then there's the other ways this fails then.  This is ridiculously priced compared to just about every other BETTER option out there.And it did not pass my first test I always do - power on the plug, then simulate a power loss.  Real plugs, things designed well, should ALWAYS come back on in the last state.  If it was off when power was lost, it should stay off when power is restored.  If it was ON when power was lost, it should be ON when power is restored.  And these Amazon plugs utterly fail that.In Wisconsin here we can get severe weather, and random power losses, even sometimes just for a split second, but it's enough to render things like this useless when it doesn't come back on again.I use these for my fridge, for my aquarium, so the inability to resume power if it was on is a massive design fail in my eyes.These also lack the ability to monitor and track energy usage and cost.  SO MANY of the alternatives out there that cost less can track energy use and cost and turn back on when power is restored.So while this is amazing for how simple it is to set up, it's an utter fail in every other respect.",Easiest to set up but that's the ONLY benefit,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,20549,5341,71394,Public

That's sad to say, but it is clearly labeled as such. That wouldn't be such an epic failure if it weren't for the stupid Echo devices that happily connect to your 5Ghz band and are then unable to recognize these plugs. Really, Amazon, we're nearly 20 years into the 21st century. This whole Smart Home domain is so spectacularly immature in terms of technical quality, homogeneity, interoperability... this kind of rubbish is not the way to present your products. You, out of all of the competitors in this market, should stand up it and do it right. But instead you come up with a smart plug device that right out of the box stands at best a 50% chance of working with your own Echo products. Realistically more like 25% because I suspect that the Echos will default to 5G on a dual band network. and how many people are going to be running 2G-only networks in their home? How about in five years?  Way to poison your own well, Amazon. My Echo Dot was easier to integrate with your competitor's smart home hub than with these stupid plugs. ""Smart"" plug... that's being generous.So anyways, for anyone still reading, if your Echo won't recognize your plug, it's probably because you have a dual band wifi router, and your Echo is on the 5Ghz band. These plugs for sure will be on the 2Ghz band and that is a no-go.  This is typical of these kind of devices - lots of manufactures document this, or consumers end up figuring it out on their own - but in the end you've got to get your Echo on the 2G band on the and on the same SSID as the plugs. Oh, and probably whatever phone or tablet or whatever you're using to do the configuration too. That's what I just did. What a pain. I created a new SSID enabled for 2G only on my access point and rejoined the echos, the plugs, and my tablet to that SSID. And yes, I verified that the Echos were previously on the 5G band. Definitely, they were. And I could see the plugs on the 2G band. Thing is, just putting the Echos on 2G is not sufficient. I did this first, just to check. They have to be in the same SSID as well, unless your wifi gadget is willing to do some channel bonding tricks that mine doesn't do.

I increased my 2-start rating to a 4-star rating because of the immediate follow-up from my first review posting and because it is currently working.

I would prefer to do it on a desktop computer, but I don't think that is possible.  I have a number of Amazon Echo and Fire TV devices, so I know the installation drill by now.  However, for the first few times, it was confusing in that I could move through the menus faster than the devices could be initialized, etc.  All in all, setup and installation could be a bit more user friendly, with real people and not tech experts writing the instructions.I have two of these plugs in operation at the moment.  My only complaint is that often times, it is hard to get the Amazon Echo (aka Alexa) device to wake up or understand a command. Viz. ""Alexa, turn on 'fan.' and either the Echo does not respond or it gives me some kind of runaround message about playing a tune called fan, etc.  So I have to yell, ""Alexa, STOP!"" and try again.  This is particularly true if there is a lot of background noise.  It is annoying and defeats most of the convenience of having an audio enabled device switch when this happens and it happens fairly frequently.Yet when it works, it seems to work well, with most of the issues being with the Echo command device.It is possible that I have made problems for myself by my choice of name for each dedicated smart plug.  One can rename the device when it is set up or anytime thereafter.  As I sometimes cannot remember complicated names such as ""Alexa, plug (number) on!"" where I have to remember the default plug number assigned on setup, I rename the plugs to things that are simple and easier for me to remember and to pronounce.  And it is possible that unless a specific order of words is used a miscued command results.  I find that to be true with some of the Fire TV units especially.

So the Amazon smart plugs live outside my SmartThings ecosystem. It's no problem because you can still add the plugs to lighting groups and control them through Alexa-- and execution of commands is instantaneous with both systems.One other note: The plugs initially show up in the Alexa app as ""First plug,"" etc. You can rename them in the app, i.e. ""Living room lamp,"" but the original name ""First plug"" remains in the Alexa web interface.

Coincidence?  I don’t think so, sounds like an app or plug update is causing mass failures.I tried all the troubleshooting, reset to factory defaults, start over setup, reboot router, etc., but keep getting ‘provisioning failure’ repeatedly, and my network is good since everything else works fine including Echo shows, Hue bulbs, smart lock, etc., so only the Alexa smart plugs failed today and can’t be reset or reconnected.May be time for an investigation?  What if Amazon IT folks pushed an update today and bricked our plugs?  Could be accidental or lack of testing, or is it intentional?  Don’t know, but looking at all the recent reviews with plug failures today, there ‘appears’ to be something happening across the country around the same time.Fortunately, for me, my recent purchases are under the covered period, so sending them back for free replacement, which is a hassle, but new ones should arrive in a few days.  We’ll see if the new ones have the same issue?Good luck, and I’d suggest avoiding buying the Amazon brand of plug until the failure mystery is solved...UPDATE:  12/1/2020I recently discovered that all the Amazon Smart Plug failures on Nov 25-26 were apparently caused by a problem with Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers, which lasted a couple days.  The same plugs I was having problems with, I tried one last time on 12/1/2020 to reset and reinstall, and all three of my plugs now were able to reset, connected fine and are working again.Amazon should have published or notified customers of the AWS issue and informed tech support so they could let customers know there was a backend issue at Amazon.  Lots of customers may have thrown away good plugs thinking it was a hardware issue, when it was just a backend server issue.  The plugs were likely good.So, in my experience, there was nothing wrong with the smart plugs, it was just a backend server issue, which once they resolved the server issues, all my plugs could be reinstalled and were easy to setup again and started working fine.Now, the issue this caused for me is that I requested replacements which are on the way, but there was really no need to replace because it wasn’t a hardware failure after all, it was an Amazon server problem all along.  So, I will likely just return the replacements at this point.  I’ve increased the star rating to 3, now that I know it wasn’t a plug issue, as the plugs had been working fine prior to the server glitch.The lesson learned here is that a failure with the smart plugs may not be a plug hardware issue, but just a backend server or software issue, so wait a few days, maybe a week, and try resetting again.  In may case, all three smart plugs that failed on Nov 25th, are now working, and reset process worked fine after server issue was resolved.",Update:  Dooms Day Nov 25th - Plugs Failed,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,56,17,4224612,Public

There are just a few things you should know before you buy and set it up. First, you must have the Alexa app on your phone to set it up, or at least this seems to be the easiest. You plug it into the wall, launch the Alexa app, and scan a QR code that comes with the packaging. Also, make sure you are in a well-lit area and your phone camera can focus well on the QR code. My first install failed to find the plug after scanning the QR code, but that's because it was dark when I scanned the code. After turning on the light to get a better picture of the QR it worked right away. So don't throw that QR code away. I'm betting you should keep it and somehow mark which QR code belongs with which plug if you have more than one, in case you have to set it up again sometime later.Once it's set up you can turn on/off with Alexa voice commands. It starts off with the name ""plug 1"" but you can change it to whatever you want. So you say ""Alexa, turn on plug 1"" and it switches on the plug. Pretty neat. If you want to schedule on/off times you have to program routines in the Alexa app, which is a bit confusing at first. I bought it to turn on a light at dusk and turn it off again at bed time. You have to create a separate routines for turning it on and off. One neat thing is you can choose sunset or sunrise as a time. You have to tell the app what location to use if you want to do this. You can also offset it up to 60 minutes before or after. I have it set to turn on the light 10 minutes before sunset. Routines are pretty versatile. You can have the plug do several things based on several forms of input, not just scheduling. You choose ""when this happens"" then ""do this."" So it can be when a particular voice command is given, when your phone is at a certain location, when a button is pressed on the Echo, etc. Because routines are for more than just the smart plug, you're presented with a list of things for actions in the ""do this"" part. Here after you choose ""Add action"" you have to choose ""Smart Home"" before you can see your devices (smart plug). The packaging comes with no instructions about all of this. I figured it out intuitively, but there is probably Alexa help somewhere on Amazon. I haven't tried, but you can probably also program it by talking to Alexa (e.g. ""Alexa, schedule plug 1 to turn on 10 minutes before sunset.""One disappointment is you need to add a third party skill to control the smart plug with the online Alexa interface (alexa.amazon.com). I was surprised not to find this feature built in. I didn't want to use something else for fear of causing problems using it with my phone app. For example, what if I program it differently with the two different apps. One more neat thing is you can turn the plug on and off using your phone.",Versatile but a bit difficult to program,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,331,220,61908,Public

It does not control the channels on my TV, but it does allow me to turn it on/off; same with my living room lamp.

With these smart plugs, I no longer have to fuss with changing those hard-to-reach timers to adjust the on/off times. My arthritic joints appreciate that.My only regret is that I waited so long to make my daily life a little easier on these old bones. I will be ordering several more of these smart plugs to help me safely move around in my home.",Easy Setup & Seamless Integration with Echo Show 8,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,652,122,20943,Public

It's getting 4 stars because I had to get help from Amazon customer support about issues not mentioned anyplace I could see. This is what I had to do:1. The plug works with a 2.3GHz network only. This is not a big shock, since 2.3GHz is more common in my experience, but I didn't see it mentioned anyplace in the documentation. The phone or other device hosting the Alexa app can be connected to either a 2.3GHz or 5.0GHz network, but the plug itself won't connect to anything except 2.3GHz. Of course, the Echos, Dots, or whatever that are controlling the plug need to be able to ""see"" the network that the plug is using.2. Turn off power saving. My Samsung S8, where I was running the app, has a power-saver setting to extend battery life. I was unable to set up the plug at all (phone couldn't find the plug) until, at the suggestion of Amazon customer support, I turned power-saving off entirely. Then the phone fould the plug, no problem.3. During the setup the plug may attempt to connect to the wrong WiFi network. In my case, it tried to connect to a network that I can't access, and the setup failed with a ""provisioning failure"". If the plug connects successfully to the wrong network, you can change the network from the Alexa app via devices -> plugs -> first plug (or whatever plug you want) -> vertical-dot menu in upper right corner -> Wi-Fi Network change. In either case, you want to hold down the power button until you get a blue-red flash and then retry the setup. If you got a provisioning failure, this is the ""retry"" button on the failure screen.4. During the retry the Alexa app will list the visible 2.3GHz wifi networks. Select the one you want.5. This time the setup succeeded for me.Note that, for me anyway, the initial (wrong) network selection had no relationship to the network my phone was connected to. Even when the phone was on a 2.3GHz network, the plug tried to connect to the wrong network.This setup isn't really that complicated, once you know what to expect and once you know how to deal with a wrong-network selection. I plan on buying more of these little things, but, sheeze, a bit more documentation and error troubleshooting in the box would be appreciated.","Good device, tricky setup",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,7,8,8215728,Public

First (obviously) I just need to point out that this review is just my own personal experience and I'm sure each person's experience can vary with a product like this. So, my personal use circumstances are as follows...I have one Echo Dot (3rd gen)I have a 2.4 GHz wireless routerI have a 7 inch Kindle Fire tabletI have this smart plug For me, when I plugged this in, the little blue light on it started to flash periodically. I hadn't yet read the instructions so I just plugged a lamp into it (so I'd know if it did anything) and left that be for a few minutes to see what would happen. Shortly, Alexa announced that she had found the plug and told me to say ""Turn on first plug"" to control it. It was pretty much that simple. However, the first time I tried it, she said it wasn't responding. So, thinking there was something else I might need to do in the app. So I started the Alexa app on my tablet and tried once more to tell it to turn on the plug. Which this time it worked. So I tried a simple timer routine to turn the plug on at a certain time and turn it off about ten minutes later. That worked. So I don't know what else to say. I was able to purchase this for a dollar as (I guess) a special offer. These are normally about 25 dollars. I had been thinking about getting one for a while but there was no way I was paying 25 dollars. Of course I understand they have to make money but this will probably be the only one I buy unless the normal prices come down at least by half.

The Amazon device is connected with the Alexa App only - and when I ask Alexa to turn off the switch, it will tell me ""The device is not responding"" and I have to manually walk to the Echo Show or go into my Alexa App on my phone to press the switch.

You can name it whatever you want so when you ask Alexa to turn it off/on - it typically responds very quickly.  You can set up a schedule in the Alexa app, but you have to create a Routine - which is not straightforward.I am using this to control my fish tank lights - it will ALWAYS turn the lights off at 9pm, in case I turn them on and forget to turn them off.  But I just like telling Alexa to turn on the fish tank lights and have them pop on quickly!Downsides - only control through alexa app, I have another smart plug that works with Alexa but connects, can be scheduled and controlled through a Smart Life app and this doesn't work with that - so it's the odd ball out.  The alexa control sometimes hangs up and says she's having trouble communicating to the device - even though it turns off/on.",Device is not responding...

The device couldn't be found by Alexa. I could see from the device's status light that it wasn't doing what it was supposed to be doing. When I first plugged it in, the device flashed red a few times then stopped. Red == bad. According to the tiny guide, that means the plug failed to set up. I hadn't even set it up before. Makes me wonder if this has been used before, but the device was fully wrapped and the box sealed shut.Anyway, after figuring out how to get the thing configured by pressing and holding the power button to get it into setup mode (no, this isn't documented in any of the included instructions... I just took a wild guess), the device hooked up like a champ.Unfortunately, the reason for using this plug is negated by a simple, but major design flaw. If the plug loses and then regains power, the plug does not return to either its previous state or on. Instead, it returns to off. For a lamp or a fan, no big deal. For my home router, yeah, that's a no go... literally... for the router.The router must turn back on after a power failure. Unfortunately, this plug's failure to return to a powered on state after power loss firmly loses it 2 stars. Every smart device like this needs to remember its last powered state or default to on. If it can't do this one simple thing upon power restoration, then it's of no use for many applications.

You cannot set up any smart device with the Alexa app until it is physically added/linked by pushing the action button. I hope this saves someone else some frustration & wasted time.

I can now ease into my day with routines designed to do all those little things that add up to one big stressor first thing in the morning. No longer do I feel like I am constantly forgetting something and this has boosted my self confidence. I am homeschooling 2 young kids and managing a household. Alexa is like having my own personal assistant and somewhat of a companion. If I could, I would hug everyone involved in the creation of these devices and their ongoing development.  They have improved my mental health and help me be a better mother and manager. I truly am grateful that this system exists and is so user friendly.The plugs specifically are great because I don't have to go around turning things on and off any longer, which sounds silly but really took a lot of time with so much else to do at once. I just set a routine and Alexa turns my fan off, dehumidifier on, and lights on in the morning. Then, at bedtime, she shuts everything down and turns the fan on which forces me to go to bed.  I now go to sleep at the right time and feel much better in the morning.  I am constantly watching for a deal on the plugs because they are pricey, but they work seamlessly.I rave about this system to everyone because it has benefitted me hugely.

After a hard reset on the product, it has been operating properly. It is nice that the Amazon Plug works natively within the Amazon Alexa app without needing a third-party app for the product. I also like that you can stack two on the same outlet. They need to update the QR code scanning feature in the app so that you can turn on your phone's flashlight in order to scan the code in dark places.Original Review: I needed another home automation plug. This one runs my living room lights on a routine and replaces the mechanical timer we've typically used during the winter months. I purchased the Amazon version and paid a little more because I thought it would be more convenient to stick with a native Amazon product. Unfortunately, my unit has become unresponsive twice during the week I've had it. That means I've woken up twice and saw a glow from the hallway like someone was awake and in the living room, only to find that the time-based routine couldn't execute. The wifi route is approximately 20 feet from the plug and in clear view. Now I'm disappointed and need to consider buying a non-name-brand replacement.Setup was very easy, but make sure to set it up in a brighter area, otherwise you'll have issues scanning the QR code.",Updated Review: Now Works As Prescribed,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,207,60,3887822,Public

I would say that if you're going to get a smart plug, get the Amazon brand one, which is specifically designed to work with Alexa. The app integration is seamless. Once you purchase, it remembers your Wi-Fi signal credentials if you already have other Alexa devices signed into your Wi-Fi network. So all you have to do is plug it in, and it sets itself up. With these plugs, you can use them to turn electronics on or off. But if you want to use it with a lamp, just plug in the lamp, and in your Alexa app settings, choose to ""treat the plug like a light"". Once you give it a name, designate what room it is in, you can just tell Alexa to turn off the lights, and it will control the switch. In other words, you can treat the switch like a plug or like a light, which is really important when it comes to setting up routines and giving Alexa commands. The thinner profile means that you can put two of these plugs into a standard socket, it saves space. However, it is still the same initial design. I would like to see for Amazon to come up with a multi socket smart plug surge protector. This would be more practical. I currently own five of these plugs, One controls the fan, One controls a light in a room, I'm setting one up to control my TV. Keep in mind, though, that this will only give you power functionality. You can only turn things on or off. It's not like a smart bulb that you can control with Alexa using various voice controls to change the light settings.","Easy to use, works great.",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,101,74,1098917,Public

We plugged in the humidifier and it has worked great till this morning. I woke up and the humidifier was off and so I tried to get Alexa to turn it back on. That was a no go.

I received a call from Amazon technical support to help me fix the issue. I missed their call so Jeremy said he would email me. I returned the email with a day and time to get a call back. I plugged the smart plug back in the wall and forgot about it. A few minutes ago I noticed the light was a steady blue. Once I saw that I told Alexa to turn on the plug. It did. I am totally confused as to why but it works now. I also have to add I am impressed with Amazon technical support and how they actually try to help. Kudos for that! So Jeremy if your reading this you can cancel that support call. LolI must add that before this little incident the smart plug worked perfectly fine. Easy set up and no problems.

I have several WEMO plugs which are a bit temperamental to set up and remain activated. The Amazon plug has been working flawlessly for over a month on various lighting devices as well as appliances. It is controlled by use of Alexa and iPhone app. I have found no difficulty in it reconnecting itself back to wifi after a power outage. With and without an outage I have found connectivity issues with the WEMOs, which caused me to have to manually reset the devices or ""forget"" them on the Alexa webpage so that they can be rediscovered. This is almost impossible without being physically present at their location. The Amazon plug has been reliable in this aspect. So why not 5 stars? Because the plugs can be controlled by any stranger that has access to your Alexa! I changed the name of my plug, which Amazon has defaulted as ""First Plug"". Even though the app shows the new name, the Amazon web account page still shows ""First Plug"" and not the new name. When I tell Alexa to turn on the plug by its new name, she does. BUT also will turn on the same plug when you tell her to turn on ""First Plug"". A co-worker's young child thought it humorous to tell Alexa to turn on First Plug, Second Plug, Third Plug, and on down the line until he found the one wanted activated. The problem was that many lights were activated causing alarms to be activated as well as an electric heater in an outside shed. All the plugs had been renamed and the name kept confidential to prevent accidental activation, yet they were all being activated by their default names. I searched the Alexa/Amazon help section and was not able to find a solution to remove the default name from Alexa's control nor was I able to change it to the new name from my laptop on my Amazon account. I was looking to replace all my WEMO devices with more Amazon Plugs, but will wait for Amazon to resolve this issue. Could it be just my and my co-workers plugs? Possibly.

Plus this is pretty expensive and I really feel that there has to be cheaper options out there.Set up for this was honestly a little bit of a pain. The unit didn't connect quite as cleanly as was promised, but once it was completed it was generally fairly easy to operate. Mostly the unit didn't want to connect with Alexa unless I scanned the barcode.This wasn't quite as unobtrusive as was promised, as some of my other devices didn't really fit, either because of how the cord was set up or because the general plug as a whole was too big. It's not a huge deal breaker, but it was a little frustrating having to shuffle everything around.Since then it's generally been pretty nice and I'll admit that it's handy to be able to walk into the bedroom and turn out the light in the other room, omitting my having to walk to my bedroom in the dark or backtrack once the bedroom light is on. That in itself wouldn't be so bad except that there are things to stub my toes on and a cat that likes winding around my legs in the dark, so being able to see is pretty awesome.Overall this isn't bad and if this was half of its current price then it'd be much more reasonable of a purchase. I got this when it was on sale for a dollar, which I recognize being far too cheap to sustain on a regular basis, but something less expensive than its current price of twentyfive would be ideal.","OK enough, some issues with outlet space",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,6194,1923,4564,Public

But, then I also can set it up as a group and say, ""Alexa, turn on living room (lights)."" In addition, I can add a routine (timer) so that my living room turns on after sunset, and off before I go to bed. And each plug can have separate on/off timers set.Honestly, these plugs have been convenient when it comes to finding remotes or turning switches physically on.

I've had to manually push the button to turn it back on a couple of times until the internet was restored, a pain. Secondly, it depends on the Alexa app for remote control, so if the internet is down, so is Alexa. My other smart plugs have their own phone apps, and I can still control them via their apps as long as my local wi-fi is still working, even if my Comcast internet is down.

Enter the smart plug. Ordered it on a whim to see if it would replace us having to reach in behind the tv to plug/unplug and it did just that. We named the plug tv, plugged the tv into it, and now every time we need to re-sync the remote we just tell Alexa to turn the tv off and turn the tv on and Bob's your uncle. There might have been a way to fix this issue with the remote or tv without this, but my dad hates technology and he certainly wasn't taking it off the wall to take it back so this was the next best fix.

It seems that having my router config with a hidden SSID was a problem for the smartplug. It isnt able to detect a wi-fi access point unless the SSID is broadcasting. That was awfully annoying because I was not going to cut access to everything else just to switch the SSID to publicly broadcast. Seems like somewhat of a security risk to endure just to connect the smartplug. Instead, I connected the smartplug to a different router in the house that does have its SSID broadcasting publicly.Once I got that all sorted out I came across the issue of not every simple appliance being compatible. My lamp has a simple touch-based switch. Did not work whatsoever despite powering it on and off before powering the smartplug on and off.After a few different devices, I put it to use with my record player. The record player is the one device that I would always have to plug in when in use and unplug when I knew I was not going to be using it for days at a time.

Instead of having to reach down into the corner with all the wiring and plug that sucker into the UPS unit, I can now simply use the remote on firestick 4K , and simply say ""Alexa, Power on the plug"". Right away the plug switches on, the record player is powered, and I can immediately reach for some vinyl to listen to.So while its not hassle-free from the getgo and won't be ideal for a lot of devices, once you find just the right device for it, you'll enjoy having it installed.For the low price that it was during purchase,  I am certainly satisfied with what I got.I have never been one for the smart home trend, but little things like this add lots of conveniences to otherwise minor annoyances.",it was just what I was needing,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,38,35,1764129,Public

While waiting for that, I left the device plugged in, on the off chance it would update its firmware, since there was no way to update it directly via the Alexa app.  A few days later I got an email asking me to retest the device since Alexa Support had noticed a firmware update had been pushed to it.

Whether it’s turning these on/off on a schedule like sunrise/sunset or at a given time, if I use the Alexa app and set all 3 devices to power on or off using the same schedule attribute or time, there always seems to be some asynchronous action. In other words, there can often be seconds difference (even 30-60 seconds, I’ve timed it) where the same exact product, all on the same WiFi network, meant to be triggered at the same exact time, does not trigger simultaneously. The only thing I can think of is that these IoT devices are speaking to different servers within my region/time zone, or the actions (when there’s more than one schedule-sensitive routine item) get triggered in succession. I have tried as Amazon support recommended to reset the device to factory and re-join it to my network, Re-build the routine and everything. It does not resolve the issue.

I don't want to use this technology where 'hacking' might really do some damage, however.I did have one instance of a problem with it, which makes me re-think wide deployment of them:  Once, for some reason, I had Alexa turn this outlet ""on"" as was commanded - but when I asked Alexa to turn it ""off"" Alexa said that it had lost contact with it - so the outlet remained ""on"" indefinitely until I looked for a switch and discovered the almost-invisable On/Off switch on its side.RECOMMENDATION:  Maybe, someday, engineers could build-in a routine ""ping"" system - wherein the plug would obey the owner's commands (in Setup) of what to do (stay ""on"" or turn ""off"") after an owner-set period of ""no contact time"".  So, for instance - it all contact is lost (no pings) for 30-minutes - it would shut-off and reset itself - OR - if after contact is lost for 5 minutes, it could reset itself and turn back ""on"" if so programmed.

I can simply tell Alexa to turn off and on.  I have mine on a lamp to use as a timer too, which is where the first issue comes in.  I would think you'd be able to just make a routine to have it turn on and off an certain times, but it isn't that simple.  I found I needed to add a ""turn on"" event, then a ""delay"" and then a ""turn off"" event in one routine just so I didn't have a dozen different routines.  There should be simpler way to set up a timer function.The other issue was the initial set up, which for me took quite some time.  Firstly, the provided paper instructions and those I found online are different, so you need to be aware of long pushing the button for set up.  After this was discovered, it still did not connect.  I showed up on my Alexa app, but to no work, telling me the ""server is offline.""  Through more trial and error, I discovered that you need to give it a lot of time to find itself between steps.  First I'd get the plug in set up mode, and leave it for a few minutes.  Then I'd add it in Alexa.  I then had to wait a solid half hour before it became connected.  This just doesn't live up to the whole idea of plug and play.Again, once it's working, it's great, but there is much more work and creativity required to get it working than there should be.  I think I'll try some other plugs too to see if they are better.","Works, but slow setup, and some weird functionality",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,69,31,78945673,Public

Regarding the device, great invention! The downside is that these plugs should be redesigned to rely on network/router connectivity when the internet goes down, cuz Alexa is sorely limited without the internet. In my case, I used it for indoor lighting. As stated, in under a year it failed. To attempt to fix it, I tried a software update, deleted and re-added it to the Alexa app, manually reset it and tried re-pairing it, power cycled it, verified the internet connection was good - nothing worked...except replacing it with a different one. Replacing it worked like a charm. Too bad that’s not what I intended when buying the defective one. 😀 Despite the unfortunate events, these plugs have a lot of potential.

My Echo Dot did not announce the new plug as it did before so I had to go through the arduous setup process. I tried scanning the tiny included bar code with my Fire 7 tablet and could not get the camera to focus close enough to see the bar code clearly. So I installed the Alexa app on my phone and got the bar code to focus but the app still could not read the bar code. Then, the app switched to a different screen and had me press the power button on the plug until it flashed blue and red. I did that and the app started scanning for the plug. That failed and I ended up going through the setup process multiple times until it finally found the plug in the blue/red mode. Now, my Echo Dot announced it found a new device, ""Second Plug"". Okay -- or so I thought. I then moved the plug to a different outlet and told Alex to turn on ""Second Plug"". Alexa announced ""Second Plug is not responding"". After trying this a few times, I ended up deleting the plug from the app. After wasting an hour trying to set this up, I was ready to return it when the Echo Dot announced it found a new device, ""Second Plug"". I then asked Alexa to turn on ""Second Plug"" and was back with ""Second Plug is not responding"". What?! I deleted the plug and unplugged it, waited an hour, plugged it back in and waited for the Echo Dot to find it. This time it found it and could turn it on and off.My best guess is there were dueling Alexas trying to setup the new plug: the Echo Dot; Alexa on my Fire 7; and Alexa on my phone. Unplugging and deleting the new plug then closing all Alexa apps must have cleared it from Amazon Central. My best advice if you buy one of these is to let your Echo Dot find it and do not use the Alexa app. Also, I would like to see a larger bar code included in the box so the Alexa app can see it and allow that step to work for those without Echo devices. I dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 because of this difficult setup process.Original:This smart plug is very easy to setup if you have only one wi-fi network and allow Amazon to store your wi-fi password. After opening the box, I read the instructions with a number of fairly involved steps. As it turned out, all I had to do was plug it into the wall outlet. After a few seconds, my Echo Dot announced the smart plug was ready and even told me the voice command needed to rename it. I'd rate that experience 5 stars.However, I prefer these IoT devices be on the guest network and not my primary network so I had to go through a fairly involved sequence to switch to the guest network. I put the smart plug in setup mode, connected my Fire Tablet to the smart plug (the Fire Tablet took a couple of minutes to scan and find the smart plug) , selected the guest wi-fi network. The Fire Tablet then took a couple of minutes scanning again for some reason. Not too bad but if Alexa had asked which network to connect the smart plug to, I would have rated this 5 stars.The other concern is the relay inside this new smart plug. This smart plug replaced a different, obsolete smart plug. The old smart plug had a substantial, loud click when I turned it on. This new smart plug has a soft, quiet click. The fan I have connected is well within the rating of the smart plug and I'm hoping this smart plug holds up with such a small relay inside.",Easy To Setup For Most Folks - Or Not,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,360,57,843511,Public

I have purchased two of these plugs and here is my experience with each of them.First PlugThis plug is used to control a lamp that has an on/off switch that semi-broke when a labrador retriever tipped the lamp over.  The switch still works, but you have to turn it just right or the knob comes off completely.  So we left it in the on position permanently and we used to manually plug/unplug the lamp when we needed extra light.  Amazon often runs promotions for these plugs so I think we picked this up on Prime Day or Black Friday.  This plug for some reason I couldn't scan the QR code and had to manually setup.  Once setup, it worked fine with Alexa controlling it as a light.  We renamed it to ""light"" from ""first light"" so we could just say ""Alexa, turn on the light"" or ""Alexa, turn off the light"".  It was setup so long ago I have no idea how it got grouped into lights.  Our lamp doesn't have a smart bulb.Second PlugThis plug is also used to control an on/off switch.  This plug was a major pain to setup.  I tried both the QR code and manual setup.  Sometimes it would connect to my wifi and sometimes it would not.  If it setup, I couldn't turn it off or on using Alexa app for android for a quick test (my Alexa speaker isn't nearby).  If the setup timed out, I would get various errors on not being able to see the plug or not being able to connect to wifi.  Finally, I figured out the plug was flaky because of the distance from my wifi router.  I happened to have a Netgear EX2700 (2.4Ghz only) laying around because my wife used to need it for an old Lenovo Yoga when she was in college.  I setup the wifi extender again (after a factory reset as it was setup for an old password) about half way between my router and the Amazon plug.  This time the QR code scanning worked.  I used the same password for my network name plus ""_EXT"" on the end.  I think the Amazon smart plug must have tried this network with the strongest signal and the saved password because I didn't have to pick the network and retype my password after I previously chose to save it.  Finally, I could control the lamp from my phone which this time was grouped among my smart plugs.  I renamed ""Second Plug"" to ""Piano Light"" and it was good to go.One thing the Alexa app can't tell you is the signal strength and reliability of your WiFi network.  It might show it briefly when choosing the network (signal strength), but it would be nice to see it constantly displayed within the app when showing the network your plug is on.  This way if you're going into your device list settings to see what's wrong with the device it might show a flaky signal which would explain why you can't control the plug with your voice or the Alexa app.  It doesn't have to constantly show this signal, only when you open device settings.  I can understand the limitation of the wifi radio they can put into these plugs and thus the need for extenders if you get far enough from your router.  I am using a NETGEAR R6700 Nighthawk AC1750 Dual Band Smart WiFi Router, Gigabit Ethernet (R6700) also bought from Amazon.",Used to control multiple floor lamps (setup can be tough),Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,373,209,124835,Public

I bought 3 of these when they recently went on sale for $4.99.  Figured for that price it was worth giving them a try.  I didn’t really consider how I would use them at the time, more just excited at another Smart Home device.Did some research on what other people used theirs for and largely it came down to 3 functions...turn on window AC units, turn on table lamps, and turn on coffee makers.  Well, I have Central AC, overhead recessed lighting and my coffee maker can be programmed with a schedule so I was out of luck for this applications.  Well, the time of year does work as it turns out these are great plugs for timing Christmas lights and tree.  That is what I am currently using them for and for the most part they work great.I have had no issues setting routines.  I have some lights scheduled to come on at sunset and go off at 1am and then other routines for different times.  It all works perfectly, so no complaints.  Alexa integration has been seamless and I have had fun terrifying my kids by remotely turning on and off lights.End-of-the-day this device turns on an outlet in a smart manner you can control.  Any device that you plug into it that also needs it’s power button pressed in order to operate is really not going to work effectively with these plugs.  It is a simple, smart device....just keep your expectations realistic.","Smart, but Simple...Make sure you can use it before purchasing",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,165,38,1881109,Public

I was pretty excited about being able to use it to turn my bedroom light off and on, but no matter what I do, I cannot get it connected. I have followed the instructions on the Alexa App on my laptop,phone, and through the Amazon Alexa site. I have tried to install it by reading the barcode, and manually without reading the barcode. My Echo can't ""find"" it. The two times the app said "" plug found"" and told me to ""continue"" it spent 20 minutes trying to connect to my WiFi and ""failed"". I have no clue what else to do. My laptop suggests I update the app, but when I follow the link it says the link does not exist. I had planned on buying  several plugs, but not now. At least this one was ""free"". They really need to update the Alexa Apps, especially the desktop version. It took me half a day to get my Echo and two dots set up. There is so much potential here. I hope they get the apps and peripherals straightened out.UPDATE - 04-04-2019: Kelly, from Alexa Support, contacted me concerning my problems with the plug. She was extremely pleasant and helpful, and spent several hours working with me on set-up. Since we could not get the plug connected to Alexa, she is sending me a new one and will call back after it arrives to help set it up. I still stand by my one star rating for the plug I have, but I would easily give Amazon Support a ten star review!UPDATE: 04-09-2019 After many more attempts at trying to set the plug up, it is finally working. My husband put the plug on an extension cord and held it within two inches of my phone. The app on my phone ""found the plug"" and prompted him to select setup. He did. It failed with the usual (-1:-1:-1:-1:) error code. He then selected ""Try Again"" and miracle of miracles - this time it found it and accepted our WiFi code. We are using the plug to turn our bedroom lights on and off and it is working flawlessly. I will also add that Amazon support regularly emailed me concerning the problem and requested I call them so their support tech could work with us. I asked my husband to call them, but he decided to give it one last try. Amazon provides great support.","Updated from ""Nice Paperweight"" to ""Works Great""",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,548,177,51827,Public

I ordered the smart plug with two Echo Plus speakers and the subwoofer.After I connected the new devices, my old Echo (first generation) and older Echo Dot no longer would stay connected for more than about ten minutes, even after resets. I finally gave up on them. Additionally, my older fire tablets would not allow me to stream music, stating that there was no internet connection, even though non-music apps were able to connect normally. I gave up on them also, after hard resets and router restarts failed to correct the problem. After about a week, the new plug stopped working, with the flashing red light displayed. The instructions seemed a little different than the first plug, but I still could not successfully complete reconnection until I unplugged the new Echo Plus speakers and subwoofer. Whether it was coincidence or not, the new plug worked again. It seems possible that the new stereo subwoofer pair is causing conflicts. I don't know why I have these issues, and it has been frustrating and stressful instead of making life easier.

Great aspect is this particular smart plug does not hog all the outlets.When activating, linking the plug into the Alexa network, I needed to press the button to get the plug into setup mode. Then, I went into Alexa to add the device to my account. That sequence went quickly and smoothly. You are then able to set up schedules, or turn the plug on/off via voice command or a toggle switch in the app. Of course you're also able to turn the plug on/off with the button on the plug.Must confess, recently started building my Alexa network with 3 echo dots and assorted plugs. So far, very impressed with the ease of setup and usage. Adding this Amazon brand smart plug looks unobtrusive, appearing somewhat plain, which is ideal for a smart plug. It is balanced, not heavy, and has the expected Amazon quality (well designed and constructed). The only downside is the cost. I am surprised that it's one plug for $25 (some companies offer 4 Alexa compliant plugs for $30, with some sale specials making the cost even less. If this plug had a mic included to accept vocal commands directly, it's be great. A speaker would be even more fantastic, but I understand that would make it a totally different product. Anyway, the plug can be controlled with the Alexa app or with activated echo dot 3 units I own.An aspect that may slip notice to many, but I think is critical: the 15A capacity. This is important if you're using any device that draws significant power. Many of the other smart plugs have a 10A capacity, which is fine for lamps, but is a huge difference compared to this smart plug. This difference is probably a significant factor in the cost. My thought is better to have a higher Amp rating, to provide 'buffer' room.Overall, I love this smart plug. Want more! That's a definite endorsement.High, high recommendation for this smart plug.",Exactly as described and depicted.

Made far worse by the minisucle size, and, extra stupidly, printing it as gray instead of black! Three things would make it better: make it bigger, make it black, and, most important, use lower case letters.2) It comes with no instructions, and the the Alexa app never suggests that may you need to go down deep and do fancy configuration. It just says presents you with the plug and encourages you to turn it on and off. But when you do, it says ""device unresponsive.""

I use the plug to control a fan. On a side note, before I ordered the plug I made sure that it would work with the fan. I turned the fan on and then unplugged the fan, it turned off (obviously) and when I plugged it back in, it turned on, so that meant it would work with the plug. For example, I have another fan that uses electronic controls, so I can turn that fan on and then unplug it and then when I plug it back in, it would be off and I would need to turn it on again, so that type of fan would not work with this plug.

I prep my coffee at night and now it starts brewing a few minutes before I get up and I have it set to turn off before I leave my house.

Unfortunately, the Amazon smart plugs work more slowly and less consistently than the other plugs I own, and have had many more problems w/r/t connectivity and pairing on a home network made of enterprise-grade equipment.At a basic level, the Amazon Smart Plugs appear to need to send traffic back and forth to an Amazon server to connect with a phone and the Echo, based on their pairing process and the sheer amount of delay between commands being received and executed. What's worse is that a single plug can't be paired to more than one phone for use in the Alexa app, so if you want multiple people to be able to modify routines etc., you're out of luck. Whoever the first person is to set it up will be responsible for that plug, forever.This is in stark contrast to the other smart plugs I own, which all work over local wireless, and pretty flawlessly - once they're paired up to an Echo and their respective skills are downloaded, they stay paired. The WeMo plugs have easily performed the best of the ones we've tried, and have the cleanest-looking app.If an Amazon plug gets un-paired, for whatever reason - issues staying connected to local wireless, in my case, where other plugs had no such issues - good luck getting it to work without factory resetting it. You won't be able to just unplug it and plug it back in, like another plug - no, because of Amazon's pairing process, it will need to be completely set up again. The Amazon Smart Plug changes its name to ""First Plug,"" Second Plug,"" etc. based on how many plugs you have paired and what order they're connected. Guess how many ""First Plugs"" I have?Apologies for not writing a more comprehensive review, but my end point is this: these things are fundamentally bad on a basic level, because Amazon can't let them just sync locally like a regular plug, and that leads to issues. I'll still be standardizing my smart plugs, but I'll be sticking with WeMo, and I suggest you stick with whatever non-Amazon brand you've likely already started with.",Worse than WeMo (and most other plugs),Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,62,44,1853675,Public

We eventually found a use for it in a garage power strip that had plenty of real estate to spare.  We have found both the Gosund and TanTan round design smart plugs, also purchased here on Amazon, to offer more flexibility due to their smaller footprint.

I finally got it connected to wifi, but the plug would not respond to alexa commands.  By this time I was just randomly trying stuff to get it connected and responding.  I finally succeeded.  That lasted about a month.  Until yesterday, when it all stopped working yet again.  If you want to take a chance and try connecting this plug so you can amuse your friends by turning your lights on and off with your voice, go for it.  It might work a time or two.  If you are depending on it working regularly I'd advise just continuing with whatever is working for you now, and giving Amazon another year or so to work out the bugs, or just give up on it altogether.Update: Just a few minutes after I posted this review I got a call from Amazon offering help in getting things working again.  I declined, since I have decided to give up on getting this to work consistently.  I thought it fair to point out the quick response and my hope that they will be able to assist those more resilient than I.",Not worth taking a chance,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,70,18,2693962,Public

Since the Smart Plug does not remember its last state when the power is restored after an outage, the heater doesn’t turn back on after an outage. Depending on your use case, this could be an issue. For this reason, I will probably swap it out for a z-wave smart plug, which brings up another item for consideration- if you are looking to integrate the plug with a home controller (SmartThings, Home Assistant, etc), you might be better server to find a less proprietary solution.

Saying, ""Alexa, turn on the TV"" works most of the time but not always which is frustrating.This plug couldn't have been any easier to install. I plugged it in and opened the Alexa app on my phone.

I actually have been using the original predecessor X10 modules for many years before that, those were the ones that used signals embedded in your home power lines, a product developed in 1975 by Birmingham Sound Reproducers (BSR) and later one of the staple products at Radio Shack.The current crop of smart plugs have one very major drawback that needs to overcome, and it is the reason I’m excited to see Amazon producing their own brand, because it may help drive the industry toward fixing its #1 problem – lack of standardization.  You see, smart plugs can only be smart if you download and install the brand of app that works with that brand plug.  You can’t use brand A’s plug with brand B’s app.  The unfortunate thing is that the more popular smart plug become the more companies are selling them, each with their own proprietary app that only works with their products.  Some of the apps are simplistic and easy to use and some would drive Einstein up a wall with their complexity.  And every day there are companies who jumped into this business going belly up, leaving customers with hardware but no app support.That’s why I’m glad to see Amazon getting into this.  There is no reason to waste 1000 words on describing this plug, in fact that would defeat everything I’m trying to say about its simplicity.  There is no need to overcomplicate it – you plug this little adapter into your power plug and Alexa sets it up for you automatically in a few seconds.  You don’t need an app to operate it (although you do have to have the Alexa app installed to use your Echo devices).  Once your device learns it and you name it from then on all it takes is for you to tell it what you want it to do, like “Alexa turn on the porch light”.  Building combination commands is very easy, in my case as I’m adding more plug controllers I can say “Alexa I’m leaving now” and various lights and other things adjust themselves accordingly.Of the many companies in this space I have standardized my house on Kasa because they get it better than anyone else but now that Amazon has jumped in over time I will slowly replace everything I own with their brand for what I hope is full compatibility and reduced concern that they won’t be around to support their systems like I predict will be true with 95% of the other brands.",What history teaches us,Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,61754,2360,21,Public

I then opened the Alexa app, promptly found it amongst my devices, and renamed it to ""The Enterprise"" so I could use it to control turning on my treasured Starship Enterprise model (See the video).

My kids are forever not shutting lights off in the house. We only have a couple lamps in the house that plug in so I could only get a couple of these. They are so damn handy though to get the lights turned off without having to go downstairs to do it. Extra bonus is you can set a routine, so I can have lights turn on in the house when the sun goes down so we don’t come home to a completely dark house or if we have to get up in the middle of the night there is always a light on and I don’t have to trek across the dark rooms praying I don’t step on a Lego or something to turn a light on. You can also turn lights off and on when you aren’t even home. I had read a review that said you couldn’t do that unless you were home on the same wifi as your plug. That isn’t true as I have Nest cameras and was able to see if the lights actually turned on or off when I wasn’t home. This brings great peace of mind for when we rarely go out of town, we can at least make it look like someone is still home by turning lights off and on.

But I love the simplicity and ease of use and the electricity savings I can’t really tell because our bill fluctuates with the seasons anyways so there is no way of knowing that we’ve saved a lot of money or not. My only peeve is when one of the kids turns off the light with the light switch, so when my routine goes to turn it on again, it can’t actually turn on because the lamp is switched off making me think that my smart plug isn’t working.Also I’m not sure if that phantom electricity is a real thing or not but these stay plugged in all the time.

Setup for the device is straightforward and easy. I noticed two issues when using the smart plug these past two days:1. You have to make sure, when using the plug, to turn on/off the device the same way. For example, I turned on my TV using my Echo Dot then, out of habit, turned it off manually before going to bed. When I tried to turn the TV on using the Echo Dot the next morning, it wouldn't work. I saw a blue light on the plug, which I realized meant the smart plug still thought the device (my TV) was on. I ended up having to tell the Echo Dot to turn my TV off (even though it was already off) and then I could tell it to turn back on. With my Smart Plug being behind the TV, the blue light was hard to notice. With that said, I now realize what to do next time this issue arises.2. The other issue is my Echo Dot decided to either update or restart today. When that occurred, the TV instantly shut off, in the middle of an intense gaming session no less.

Never got a chance to see if it worked or not.  I got onto Amazon’s return instructions and followed them to a tee and two days later had another brand new plug in my mailbox.  UPS came by and had a return label.  All I had to do was package the defective plug up and hand to him.  Amazon paid the return shipping.  I plugged the new plug in.  I plugged the same lamp into it and it was recognized by my Echo Show and now I control that lamp by voice.  It cost me $19.99 and I would order another one if I needed it.  When I come home now with a armload of packages I can turn that one light on by voice to see what I’m doing.  It also features a dimmer option so you can have that full on bright or a very low background light.  The bulb I’m using is soft white.

Setup and voice control are very easy with Alexa. I love that it doesn’t require a third party app or account—it just connects directly through the Alexa App. This plug only works for things that turn on/off with a mechanical switch, as opposed to a toggle. So most lamps are great.The plug connects through 2.4GHz WiFi, and it doesn’t seem to have a super strong antenna. So if your WiFi network is congested, slow, or spotty, this plug won’t reliably work. I initially put one of these in a bedroom and it worked fine for a couple days. Then it got disconnected and couldn’t hold a WiFi connection in that spot for more than a minute. Checking the WiFi status through the Alexa app, it looked like the plug was getting zero WiFi reception though my iPhone showed full WiFi reception in the same spot. I moved the plug to another room, and it’s been working fine. But strong WiFi reception is key to this plug functioning.These plugs are a nice way to ease into home automation without spending a lot of money and effort. I’d recommend them for a couple devices here and there, but not for deployment en masse due to their reliance on WiFi.","Fast and easy to use, with some limitations",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,21,12,1966156,Public

Unlike other plugs (At least TPLink) where the schedules are stored inside the plug, so as long as theres power the plug can keep to the schedule.

After that, it was fine. I was able to rename the plug to ""light"" so that my grandparents can just say, ""Alexa, turn on light"". The set-up probably took 45 minutes though of trying to figure out whether Alexa needed ""skills"" (which looks to be a hodgepodge of apps of dubious quality) or if the plug was the problem or if Alexa needed to ""discover"" the device from her end... or what... I think that their ""easy set-up"" assumes that you are already running Alexa on your smartphone and interfacing with her there... and the Microsoft store Alexa app looks nearly useless unless you just want to talk to Alexa on your computer (instead of work with peripheral devices including Echo).

As I have them named individually and grouped in the famiy room; I can simply say, ""Alexa, turn on family room light 1,"" or ""Alexa, turn off all family room lights.""

You must delete the plug and re-add hoping that it chooses the correct SSID the second time.  You may have to turn off one access point to force the correct one to be selected (2.4Ghz only).Calling Amazon support was frustrating.  The first agent didn’t know what an Amazon Plug was and had to do the normal interrogation process and account search for the purchase that is typical of today’s poor support industry.  The agent then transferred me to another agent who required that I explain my problem once again.  Although he had at least heard of the Amazon Plug, he did not know the product well enough to do anything other that search their database revealing the same lack of information available on Google.I was then put on hold for a good long time while being transferred to Advanced Support.  The Advanced Support agent was more knowledgeable.  He informed me that there was NO way to force a firmware update.  The plug just needed to be plugged in and inactive for some period of time so that it may update itself.  It took about an hour and the Alexa app needed to be restarted on the iPhone to see the update (it showed 1000012 (cached) even though the firmware was 1000015 until the app was restarted).I asked if I could RMA the plug and ensure delivery of a plug with the latest firmware.  The agent said no.Hopefully Amazon will address these software issues (at least 4) to bring the software up to the same standard as the solid hardware of the plug.","Amazon Plug, good hardware poor software/support",Configuration: Smart PlugVerified Purchase,,270,18,582561,Public

Still connects but unresponsive. So I called Amazon which is no easy task.  Nice person on the phone but probably as clueless as I am says she will send me a new one. Okay cool I thought since I actually had a second one here anyway (this is meant to control my Christmas tree and all of this aggravation is so I can say Alexa Merry Christmas and the tree lights up). So figuring I had a defective unit I hung up and proceeded to connect new plug. Well can you believe it same thing unresponsive. Awesome I thought if only I could call technical support maybe I could work through problem. See not first time with these not so smart doo dads. Seems they all have some trick to them.

My issue is my youngest son @ 5 years old keeps turning the light switch off as he leaves the room and sometimes on before speaking to Alexa. This disruption causes havoc with the smart plug and our simple request to turn in light.I’ve found the only simply way is to make the a more specific request such as “Alexa turn on master bedroom lamp “. I get the reply OK but no light. I then make my 2Nd request Alexa turn on light. Then the smart plug turns blue and the light comes on. The smart plug is reprogrammed.If there were an easier way to reactivate the smart plug once the primary wall switch is turn back to the in position I would be delighted. Or a simpler added rubber stop that can be added to the wall switch that keeps it in the on position to help train all family members that this is a smart switch in conjunction with a smart plug. Hope a designer is out there reading this as it’s a real simple addition to the typical switch.
