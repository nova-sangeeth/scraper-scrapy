After considering a number of options, we found the Daybetter R5032 at a terrific price, and placed an order for one package.  Once we received the R5032 package, and started considering how we could mount the LED strip(s) we decided we would like to mount the light strips in a trough near the ceiling and use them to provide indirect lighting for the room.  The two 5 meter LED strips would allow us to place lighting along two walls of the sunroom.  Not being able to decide which two walls should carry the lights, it seemed to make more sense to place the lighting all the way around the room so we considered ordering a second R5032.  This would mean that we would have two controllers, and two IR receivers possibly placed in two different locations in the room.  The LED strips come with connectors on both ends making it seem like they could be connected in series, but this is not supported by Daybetter.  The controller has two separate leads each of which connects to one of the 5 meter LED strips.  Connecting both LED strips in series to one of the controller power leads would burn out the controller.  In order to place both IR receivers in the same location, but have one of these controllers control lights that were 5 meters away, we needed extension cables that would allow power from one controller to run to a LED strip 5 meters away.  I contacted Daybetter customer support to ask if they sold such extension cables.  The next day I received an email that said they did not carry any such cables, but they did provide a link to a company that sold such cables through Amazon, and they were willing to help offset the cost of the cables.  Thanks to this quick response, I ordered a second R5032 package from Daybetter, and a set of 4 four-conductor 3 meter extension cables from HUALAND.  Connecting two of the extension cables together gave me enough length to reach an LED strip 5 meters away.  The next issue became how to build a trough in which the LED stips could be mounted.  I found a solution at my local Lowes where I discovered a vinyl door edge that was a bit larger than the 0.5 inch width and height needed to conceal the LED strip.  The size was perfect (UnmountedTrough.jpg), and the price was a tenth of what wood trim would cost to cover the same length.  Since the trough was vinyl, I needed to insure that the LED strips did not generate enough heat to melt them so I laid out the LED strips and turned them on to full brightness to evaluate the amount of heat generated by the circuitry on the strip.  The heat through the resistors on the LED strip was barely detectable.  I painted the door edge trough and installed it at the bottom edge of a 1 x 2 trim piece that already went around the room (Trough+IRsensors.jpg).  I ended up installing the LED strip along the back edge of the trough rather than the bottom of the trough because I did not think the horizontally oriented LED strip would bend nicely around 90 degree corners (LEDinTrough.jpg).  Bending a vertically oriented LED strip around the room's 90 degree corners was no problem.  Once the trough and the LED strips were installed, I then needed to place two power packs and two controllers somewhere hopefully out of sight.  An attic is directly above the sunroom so I decided to drill a hole in one corner of the sunroom ceiling, and route the 4 conductor power cables through the hole into the ceiling where the two power packs and the two controllers would be mounted.  The power pack cords were long enough to allow them to be installed almost anywhere convenient in the attic (PowerPacks+Controllers).  The two controller modules had to be installed right next to the hole in the attic floor so that the IR receiver cables could pass through the hole and be aimed out to the center of the sunroom (Trough+IRsensors.jpg).  One remote control sends a command that is received by both controllers so all light strings react in unison.  The results are highly satisfactory as I hope can be seen from some of the included pictures (LEDsunroom1-7.jpg).  The light strips provide a wide range of colors at about 5 intensity levels, and the adhesive backing made mounting in the trough super simple.  The product works great for us, and the customer support was outstanding.",Works as described...Support is terrific!,Verified Purchase,"1,121 people found this helpful",1154,5,569539,Public

They really couldn't have a sit down with a native speaker for ten minutes to get the manual straightened out?all in all it works, and for what i paid the LEDs are fine and fixing anything that comes up is well within my experience as an electrical engineer. but being targeted as an end consumer product is a little misleading.","Power supply is a little terrifying, manual is useless, but hey cyberpunk!",Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,172,140,1191222,Public

Make sure the receiver isn't hidden behind anything. The more objects that are between the receiver and the remote will reduce its ability to work.2. The adhesive works great. For best results, make sure the surface you are adhering the light strip to is clean. Even dust can affect how well the strip sticks. We applied it to the top of the crown molding (wiped off first with a dry cloth to remove dust) and it holds well.3. While applying, I found it easier to only peel off around 1-2 feet of the adhesive backing at a time. If you peel off more than that, the uncovered length may fold back and stick to itself.4. For everyone saying the DIY custom lighting option doesn't work - PLEASE watch the video. Yes, there might be instances where a remote doesn't work but we figured it out how to create and set custom colors.- From left to right on the remote, the colors are setup in Red Green Blue (RGB).- Push the DIY button you want to program- Push and hold the DOWN arrow for each color until the lights are completely off. You might have to do it a couple times because it's hard to know if all of one color is off.- When the light strip is completely dark, push the UP arrow for each color to create the DIY color you want. What you're doing is mixing the colors to create a custom color. For example, if you push the RED UP arrow all the way up to its brightest,  and the BLUE UP arrow all the way up to its brightest, it will make a Purple color (Red + Blue = Purple).- When you get the color you want, Push the same DIY button you pushed at the beginning.That's it.",These lights are great.

An attic is directly above the sunroom so I decided to drill a hole in one corner of the sunroom ceiling, and route the 4 conductor power cables through the hole into the ceiling where the two power packs and the two controllers would be mounted.  The power pack cords were long enough to allow them to be installed almost anywhere convenient in the attic (PowerPacks+Controllers).  The two controller modules had to be installed right next to the hole in the attic floor so that the IR receiver cables could pass through the hole and be aimed out to the center of the sunroom (Trough+IRsensors.jpg).  One remote control sends a command that is received by both controllers so all light strings react in unison.  The results are highly satisfactory as I hope can be seen from some of the included pictures (LEDsunroom1-7.jpg).  The light strips provide a wide range of colors at about 5 intensity levels, and the adhesive backing made mounting in the trough super simple.  The product works great for us, and the customer support was outstanding.",Works as described...Support is terrific!,Verified Purchase,"1,121 people found this helpful",1154,5,569539,Public

In that case you face a dilemma: (a) start the lights going up the wall from the close to floor or (b) have an ugly black cable with an even uglier transformer box hanging from your (likely) white wall as it reaches the lights on the ceiling.2) These are two strips that plug into a common housing/distributor box.

The outlet I need to use is near the floor, (where I assume most outlets are) so we had to run the strip of lights up the corner of the wall, then start along the perimeter.

My teenagers like them, but here are some comments from a mom...1. They are really bright and hurt my eyes! I feel like I’m walking into a nightclub when I enter their rooms. Some colors are better than others. 2. This particular set (there’s a cheaper set of these same lights) has an expanded remote that offers a lot of light combinations (the cheaper set has a smaller remote...less options). 3. Note that the 32’ set is actually two sets of 16’ with two connections. It’s not one continuous 32’ strand. One of my kids was not happy with this revelation as it made setting up more difficult. 4. It’s hard to make turns with these lights, so you have to sort of scrunch it when at a corner. Don’t make the mistake of cutting it (as one of my kids did) to turn a corner. She saw the little scissor icon on the strip and thought it was okay to cut! The only way it can be cut and put back together is with a soldering tool. Oh...and be prepared for your teenager to get frustrated  when installing these as they tend to ignore instructions.😂 Good luck!",Good lights but note my comments...,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,132,2,2165968,Public

We put at the top near the ceiling and it took almost 2 boxes to do her 10 x 12 room. The instructions are poor when it comes to connecting the light strands together and no mention that you need connectors that are not included. You can watch videos online that tell you to tape or staple but that’s hoaky so save yourself time and order connectors and a corner connector is also helpful when you first get started going up the wall and then having to make the first turn. Even with connectors we had trouble making good contact and getting the additional strands to stay on. There are two rolls in each box so we connected 4 rolls and the lights at the end are not the same brightness as the beginning. Maybe it was our installation but it definitely wasn’t as easy as some videos made it look. My granddaughter is happy.

So that is an extra $8 to $10 to order connectors including shipping.Connecting the lights. Connecting the lights is nearly impossible with the adhesive. Do not get me wrong,the adhesive works great. but trying to slide the lights together to couple them is like jamming a pancake loaded with syrup into a bank envelope. It wont happen. It jams up so bad you cannot get the pairs (12v, R,G,B) to connect properly.Once you finnally get a clean connection after scraping off the adhesive that blocks the connector, you now deal with another issue. Any remaining adhesive found on the led lights near the connection will make its presence known. Meaning, the lights will eventually produce heat. Clearly the the adhesive does not have a good melting point. Any sensitivity to heat, the connectors will break apart. I had an issue with the blue not connecting. I went to make an adjustment and the entire connector slides off due to the continuing presence of adhesive.Manufacturing tip: Just make Male/ Female end connections so it makes everyone's life easier.",Connections,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,67,65,819259,Public

These lights are kind of delicate. They’re made of a paper thin material and are easy to tear if you’re too rough with them. I messed up and didn’t follow the instructions, which said to plug them in first and then install them. Because I didn’t do that, the short power cord couldn’t reach very well and once I had them plugged in, the weight of the cord kept unplugging them and eventually caused a small tear which ruined one of the light strips. Definitely follow the instructions so you don’t do what I did. Once they’re placed, you’re not gonna want to remove them because you didn’t give yourself enough length for the power cord.In the brief moment I had them on, they looked great, but I wasn’t able to get the lights turned off in the room in time before they broke.The adhesive is very strong. It’s 3m which is very good. I peeled one of them back off my wall a little bit to realign them and it took some paint with it, so keep that in mind when placing them.I got the 32 ft one which didn’t quite fit the circumference of my room. This version came with two small reels with a light wrapped on each. Each light connects to the receiver with some weird plugs. My only complaint with this system is that the receiver needs to be plugged into the somewhat short and heavy power cord, which means it would likely be near the floor and potentially behind visual obstructions, potentially making it hard to use the remote with it.Overall I like the lights so far and think they have great potential.

Her's had connectors in between each strand that daisy chained one to another.  They also had an adhesive that was somewhat forgiving.  Moreover, she got more lights (longer strips) for the same price.So, she figured these were the same and volunteered to install them for her brother.  I thought that was nice of her so I let her go.  That was a mistake on my part.  Unfortunately, these strips have adhesive that is basically permanent.  You don't want to try and take them off if you like your walls.  Moreover, they don't daisy chain.  The power has two connectors on it, and you're supposed to connect the strips directly to the power.My daughter assumed she could daisy chain and completely ignored the additional connector.  She just put them on the walls one right after the other.  I don't know if she read the instructions but I did later and I could see how she would of missed it (thinking they were like hers).  So, we have one strip that lights up, and then a dead strip after that.  She had it working initially by taping the strips together, but that didn't hold.  She left no room for error either, the overlap of the strips was only a couple millimeters.I tried to gently pull off the dead strip, but no matter how careful I was, it took the paint and drywall paper with it.  So, this gets 5 stars for adhesion if that's what you're looking for.  I wasn't really keen on the idea of spackling and repainting the walls so I just left it and sulked.The end of the strip has 4 exposed copper leads.  If you hold them tightly together with the other strip, they do work.  So, I borrowed a couple specific legos from my son's collection.  They are 4x1 and one has a flat spot in the middle. I managed to snap the two strips together with the legos.  Like I said, she only overlapped the strips slightly, so having the lego around both sides of the strips to apply force is tenuous at best, but it is working.It stops working occasionally.  I make sure the legos are firmly pressed together and try to get the connectors closer to each other.  That usually fixes it.  If I get a chance I'll add a picture.So, to sum things up, If you buy these... read the instructions before installing, and/or don't assume they're like the other ones all the kids on Tik Tok are installing themselves ;-)  Be aware the adhesive is strong.  Good luck.",Warning: Adhesive is Not Forgiving and Strips Do Not Daisy Chain,Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,42,46,1879018,Public

They tell you to cut along the line but you be very careful because if you don’t have enough copper for the clip to latch on you won’t get a good connection. Be sure to take your time and be patient. The reason for the low star is because of the explanation but mostly because three of the dots are random colors. If you put it on red - three dots are blue and white. No way was I taking them all down because it took me a good amount of time to put them up. All and all they do the job and they will be enjoyed.,Take your time!

Once the connectors came, everything worked out; however, the second strip is a tad off in color and sometimes flickers. I’ve tried to adjust the cords and move the connector to a different part in the wire and nothing has fixed the problem. I even tried using a new connector and nothing worked. Very frustrating to look at and be in the same room with. Additionally, the adhesive is very strong so if you need to take it off or adjust the wire, the paint on your wall will come off - suggest not sticking directly to the wall and using another type of application.

Same goes for the photo showing the Kitchen.  The lighting strips have to connect in order to work.Another misleading factor is the idea that these lights are ""multicolored"". Sure, you have a choice between so many colors, but you can only display one at a time. So all of those photos showing multiple colors being used at the same time are fake.

The great thing about this small book is that it includes a “Safety Tips” section and also a “TroubleShooting” section too. If you did have a problem with your lights on the back is a “Contact Us” which has the light company’s name and they provide ways to get in touch with them for questions and concerns. This includes their website, email, and their WhatsApp. They even promise to get back to you within 24 hours and from there will give you their best advice and recommendations to help you get your lights working.

They all have the same color, none are dimmer or brighter. The adhesion is strong, although I think the way they advertised it I think the adhesion could be stronger.

For the price range, I definitely recommend this product as it definitely feels better than other similar light strips I've owned in the past which give off a cheap vibe. Everything from the adapters to battery for the remote control was included so it's ready to use at full functionality out of the box! definitely couldn't go wrong with this purchase! 10/10  recommend this :)",high quality lights that make my room look amazing now!,Verified Purchase,,33,16,78107689,Public

Not only do/would I recommend this product to others, but I myself will be purchasing more from DAYBETTER in the very near future! 1 recommendation, especially if the lights are for children, or to be used in a public place: place a piece of hook & loop Velcro on the back of the remote, and the corresponding piece of Velcro in an easy to reach, yet concealed location. Having the remote control is essential to operating these lights. So having a place for it will help keep it from getting lost, and thereby rendering the color-changing abilities and brightness adjustments for these nifty gadgets useless.",PERFECT!!

All I know is there’s a tv in every room I have the lights in and when you go to use the tv remote (I have three separate tv  remotes from different brands and they all do it) and the lights change or start strobing or going nuts. All the buttons do it. So it’s a little rough because in the middle of the night I’ll have the lights on lowest brightness and I go to turn my tv volume down and suddenly I’m being flash banged by strobe lights. If you have epilepsy it’s def a problem. It could be the volume button or channel button or any button. All tv remotes effect the lights and it’s kind of really inconvenient because it happens every time no matter where I point the remotes. They pick it up every time.

While we were waiting for the connectors to come, my daughter and I were trying to find an alternative solution on how to put this up. When we plugged the second strip into the main source, only half of it worked. Once the connecters came, we tried to attach it together and it never worked.
