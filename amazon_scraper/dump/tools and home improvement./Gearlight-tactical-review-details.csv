Right out of the box, I was impressed. This light is solid in construction and seems well made. One feature of this light, which I really like, is the auto return to high beam after it is has been off for twenty seconds. No matter which mode you were in when you turn it off, it always comes on in high beam. Switching to the other modes is easy.There is no reference as to the lumens out put, so I wrote customer service and they told me, that this light is rated at 1040 Lumens. In actual use,  it is closer to 300 to 800 lumens, depending on the batteries you are using. I installed  AAA Alkaline batteries. (3) required. They give more than enough power to light up your world. You can also use rechargeable NiMH  (Nickel- Metal Hydride) batteries. If your looking for maximum power out put, you can also use a 18650 Lithium-ion rechargeable battery. The light comes with a plastic tube for this purpose.I played with the variable focus and it works great. Set at flood mode, I lit up the side of my barn at 70 yards. These high power flash lights are not toys. You can never look directly into the beam. At 300 lumens they are intense. At full power, they are blinding. You can damage your eyes. If you have small children, they must never be allowed the play with this flash light.As with any high power LED light, they will get hot after long run time. This is normal and will not harm the light.  GearLight offers a one year warranty for this light. It is iron clad. If anything goes wrong, they will take care of it.  Considering the modest price, and 2 lights are included, and my first contact with customer service, convinced me, that this light deserves 5 stars.",Good customer service,Verified Purchase,52 people found this helpful

Extremely bright! Good feel! Several functions. I use the single lithium battery with these lights. Battery life is typically 4 days with 4-6 hours use before I have to recharge. I don't know what the life would be with 3 triple A batteries. I've dropped the light in water and an oil recovery tank. Had no trouble finding it in the 2 ft deep oil as its so bright. Clean up was easy.Cons. Gets extremely hot after a couple of minutes and I do mean hot. Switches do not stay in place. I've had to take them apart a few times and reseat the switch. It appears that maybe a retainer clip was left out in manufacturing. In a pinch you can bang the light switch side down to get it to turn on and get your job done.There are better lights available but these are very affordable and light weight.

Most significantly, no rechargable battery (although they do include the sleeve needed to use a rechargable) so of course no charger.

BIG MISTAKE!  Here are all the problems I have with it:o  The on/off button is ergonomically unusable.  The pictures show this light in someone's hands, with their thumb resting on the front of the light because that's the only place the switch could be to make this a functional tactical light.  WRONG.  The switch is on the rear end cap, making it impossible to turn on/off or select a light mode with just one hand.  If you're in a threatening situation, and it takes you two hands to control your flashlight, you're in big trouble.  You can use the switch with one hand, but only if you hold the light up next to your head, and press the button with your thumb.  That's ridiculous, IMO.o  The Amazon pic is misleading, and the description never says how big the light is.  From the picture, it looks like it's 10 to 12 inches long, and maybe 1.25 to 1.5 inches in dia.  Based on that flawed assumption, I naturally thought that this would take two ""C"" or ""D"" batteries.  WRONG AGAIN!  This light is tiny, measuring about 5 inches long, and 1 inch in dia. which causes it to have to use three AAA's that are loaded into a plastic holder.  I use a flashlight to walk my dogs, and I was going to use the strobe to scare away the neighbor's dog.  I seriously doubt that these batteries will last more than just a small handful of 30 minute walks at night.o  The light modes are goofy.  There are supposedly five, but there should only be three.  The bright light mode is good, and the beam is powerful.  That's the only good thing I can say about the light.  You can focus the beam, but not into a small spot.  At it's most intense focus, it projects about a 3' x 3' square of light at around 10'.  There's a ""blurry"" mode which I don't really understand, and another constant on mode whose purpose baffles me.  The strobe mode is OK, and the distress mode blinks out S-O-S in morse code.  OK.  That could come in handy if you're in a car wreck at night, and the distress signal doesn't wear out the small batteries.o  The lanyard is badly designed based on the on/off button being in back.  You can't reach it if the lanyard is around your wrist, at least not with my hands which are large.o  On the bright side, I give the carrying case 5 out of 5 stars.  If you want two great carrying cases for your unusable tactical light, and you're willing to pay this price for them, then this light is just the ticket.o  As with many Asian products, there are non-existent instructions included.  Maybe the light modes would be clearer to me if there was an explanation for them.  Maybe there's an explanation online, but based on the unusable on/off switch, I'm just not going to bother checking.I'm not going to return this item, because I feel stupid that I didn't read the details, and instead, I just believed all the reviews.  Don't make the same mistake.  But, if you've got smaller hands than mine, and you're only going to put this light in a glove compartment where it will hardly be used, then this might be a reasonable purchase.

I wish that I saw that before getting these. ***I hate these mode selector on this if you turn it off and then back on it changes modes.  You end up being in a strobe mode in the pitch black and it drives me crazy.  Just make a flashlight with a separate mode selector.  When I want it to default to bright it doesn't.And to say this is ""tactical"" is absurd with this function.  If I were to be clearing my house at night I would not be able to effectively use this since I would go from off to high, then off to medium, then off to low, then off to strobe, the off to SOS.  Good thing I got these to just be toolbox flashlights.The zoom slider to this is very lose as well. This is a minor issue of course but still an annoyance.  This could have been fixed with a spring loaded ball barring that could have created steps of zoom levels.  Also when zoomed all the way in you see the actual LED structure looks odd but makes that zoom level useless really.Overall the construction of this seems very solid!  It is nice heavy construction that seems like it will hold up to some abuse.  I would only worry about the slide for the zoom function as this seems to be the weakest point of the device.  I would say that these are worth the $9.50 each that I paid for them.

The switch function is well thought out, since a firm click turns it on and another firm click turns it off.  No cycling through all five functions, just to turn it off.  Dimming functions and others are accessed by a soft press of the switch, after the first firm click to turn the beam on.

When I assembled my lighting gear I decided that the cheapo LED flashlights I had needed an upgrade and were only suitable as back-ups.  I went found the pair of GearLight tactical flashlights on Amazon and decided to try them after reading both positive and negative reviews.I was very happy with the results!  This is a great flashlight for a casual camping trip.  We had no problems seeing our way along the paths of the camping grounds and our campsite.  The narrow beam can illuminate trees 100 feet away easily.A month later, the whole family went on another trip and spent a morning walking through a lava tube cave that extended nearly a mile underground.  The height of the cave varied from 5 feet to 45 feet and the width from 3 feet across to 20 feet across.  For fun, our group would stop in larger sections and turn off all of our flashlights for a minute.  It was absolutely pitch black!  With flashlights on, the wide beam was great for seeing your step forward and the walls of the cave.  The narrow high beam was good for illuminating the highest cave ceiling.We were in there for well over an hour.  I hadn't changed the AAA batteries (separately purchased Amazon brand) since I first opened the new package of flashlights.  By the very end of the cave hike, the brightness was fading.  But the light was still better than the cheaper LED lights and the headlights that some others in our party had.  Just time to replace the batteries.I will note that the park rented super high beam spotlights that looked like 3 inch by 3 inch blocks with handles attached.  The little GearLights were NOT anywhere as powerful as those spotlights.  But I did not expect them to be.At this price for two flashlights ($16 for the pair),  this is a solid piece of gear.",Great light for casual camping and vacationing,Verified Purchase,11 people found this helpful

This is one of the better ones. I have a similar light from PeakPlus which is a little better quality, but it's also about twice as expensive. This is basically two for the same price as one PeakPlus, and they're almost as good, just not quite as bright. Honestly, at a certain point, how bright a light do you really need? If you legitimately need an ultra-bright long-range light, you'll have to buy an actual spotlight anyway. This light is excellent as an emergency light to keep in your car for nighttime tire changes, etc., or a backup flashlight when the power goes out. It's not a true ""tactical"" flashlight, in that the body is too large to attach to most weapon mounts, and the focusing head is so easily moveable that you can't lock in a certain width of the light beam, and it's too big to be easy to stick in your pocket. It does come with a velcro holster for each light, which is nice.Overall, you're not likely to find a light this bright, at this quality, for a better price.

For the price, and if you're looking for something to keep in the nightstand, this is a good light, and I recommend, just level set your expectations.I mean seriously, I grew up with cheap plastic flashlights that you had to wack a couple times in your hand to get working, so anything that lights up once the batteries are in fulfills the purpose.

When I decided to go for a 2-pack of the larger, three battery model for more power and versatility, a hard lesson was learned.  I got one that we could make work after an hour of playing with the batteries and NEVER got the other to work.  Every battery for every device I've ever owned was installed with the negative (flat) pole facing the spring and the positive (little bump) against a flat contact.  This unit has three batteries and after much futile experimenting got one to work by installing them all backwards (bump on battery to spring in unit).  The other one never worked whatever combination of polarities we tried.  The best explanation is that an untrained, illiterate, underpaid, third-world-country simply glued in the connections incorrectly and the factory obviously doesn't verify they work prior to shipping.  By the time we realized we couldn't get the second one to work at all, we had already disposed of the return shipping packaging.  So, basically, we have one unit that no one will ever remember how to install the batteries in the future and one that never worked at all with no way to return them.  That's what happens when I get lazy and use Bozo's company instead of just driving down the street,paying another couple of bucks (or sometimes even less), keeping local folks employed, and can verify the quality and effectiveness of the product I'm buying.

The batch I recently received left me disappointed. First, the end of the flashlight that is used for the zoom, has little/no resistance and slides easily on its own. It will not stay in one position. Second, it is impossible to not change the ""mode"" every time the flashlight is turned on/off. Therefore, if you just want to use the flashlight in the ""high"" beam mode, you have to turn it on/off several times to cycle through the five modes. This is very frustrating as the instructions imply that when you just turn the flashlight on/off, it will not change the mode.To be fair, I notified the seller via email immediately and will update my review if this gets resolved. I am hopeful it was just a bad batch of flashlights.UPDATE 9/4/20: Seller contacted me very quickly and sent replacement flashlights that did not have the issues in my original order.

First thing I want to say is that these flashlights are 15.99, which is a price point that is very important when looking at these lights. For that price these are really nice flashlights. I have more expensive flashlights that I use for work and to carry every day, but these are really bright flashlights that take 18650 batteries (so great battery life) and are just great spare flashlights.I purchased these originally for spare lights to use and share at my work, where I use flashlights consistently over an 8 to 10 hour shift to look through machinery and clear areas. The lights are bright, probably about 700 lumens, and they do have great battery life. However everything can be unscrewed easily and can fall apart.That adds to my rating, like I've stated these flashlights cost 15.99. When they fell apart on me I didn't think nor ask for replacements, but the sellers contacted me and replaced them anyways. Great customer service that honestly I would have never expected so I agreed to try them again and review them once again.So for me I'm going to keep these as spares to let my handlers use at work and to use them around the house and in emergency kits. To solve the issue I had, I used some loctite on the threads and now these flashlights have zero issues.So in conclusion.

The review was written by a team who  tested this product and several other brand names that were getting five star reviews on Amazon.  This item was currently rated with four stars. There were pages and pages of reviews for this category and I had to sort thru them to find a review that I deemed to be honest and reliable. I read several reviews who did not pick this flashlight for best of the year, but this review was logical, well written, and non-byassed, and it caught my attention because the others seemed to go by brand names rather than performance.I wondered why this particular light was picked for the #1 spot, since there appeared to be better, more expensive flashlights on Amazon, rated with more stars. My first tactical flashlight was a Caterpillar. It was a gift from a friend, and it was extremely bright but got very hot, and the batteries lasted only a couple of hours before I had to recharge it. Needless to say, I was now hooked on the new LED technology and how bright these small handheld flashlights were these days. I am old school. The flashlights I remember were bulky, required large D cell or C cell batteries, and you needed an army of them to do the job that just one of these new age flashlights can do. They just were not as efficient as the lights being sold today.So, I purchased an Anker LC90 rechargeable thru Amazon next to try and find a better product that did not get as hot with longer lasting battery life and while I waited for its arrival, started to read reviews outside of Amazon. That's when I stumbled on this item.Why did this cheaper flashlight, a lesser rated item thru Amazon, get picked for the #1 spot thru a credible team of testers?After wrestling with my conscience, I finally convinced myself to order this item from Amazon, and I am glad I listened to my inner instinct.Both the items (the Anker and this item) arrived within a day of each other.  This one arrived even before the Anker which was days late (although that was the fault of UPS and not the manufacturer). When the Anker arrived, I was finally able to make the comparison.First off, this item delivered TWO flashlights. The other supposedly better, more expensive flashlight only included one. Secondly, this not only cost less and included two, but it produced a brighter light (my vision is poor, so the difference was immediately noticable). Lastly, the quality of this item ranks right up there and seems to be the same quality as the more expensive Anker.I must add that I was not grieved for already purchasing the more expensive flashlight that only included one item because this gave me the advantage of having the more expensive flashlight as a sort of base in which to hold as a standard to compare with.I can now see why the #1 spot for ""Best Flashlight 2020"" was awarded to this flashlight by that team of reviewers, and I would purchase this flashlight again if I were ever to lose the one I have.I am a very happy, satisfied customer. It paid off to do my homework and to read reviews outside of Amazon.Mike V.Albuquerque, NM",MUST READ THIS REVIEW!,Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

I can't tell if the item is used or new.Also, I'm noticing that the flashlight does not remember the last mode I left it in when turned off (I prefer to leave it in low-powered mode). When I turn it back on, it sometimes comes on in the mode after that (strobe), and I have to cycle all the way around to get it back to low-powered. Sometimes it comes on in high- or medium-powered mode.

Here is my first impression.Is the product worth the money? Yes. Does the product have value? Yes. In fact, these flashlights are undervalued.The flashlight itself shows outstanding American craftsmanship and I will expect this to last a very, very long time. It is well engineered, well made and certainly functional. The most likely point of failure is the zoom mechanism. (see below.) However the only test will be time and there is no indication it will fail for a very long time. The switch mechanism, the only other failure point, also shows no weakness.It comes with adapters for either a single rechargeable lithium battery or three AAA size standard or rechargeables.That's the good news.The bad news? The optics of the light are crap. Sort of defeats the entire purpose, eh?If the purpose of the light were to project an image of the LED at a distance, this product would be a 100% success. It is serviceable as a general area light and illuminates an average sized room or an average campsite well—a warehouse or arena would be another matter.The lens is plastic—to be expected at this price point. It is fairly well protected by the case. This brings up the focusing mechanism—the need for this is debatable. The beam is adjustable from flood to spot. It is based on the lens rather than the reflector. My service light is a Streamlight and is not adjustable. In fact, most ""tactical"" lights are not adjustable.Should you buy this light? For this price, that is almost a ridiculous question and the answer is an equivocal yes. If you have need to search for perps or prey and your life or others are dependent on lighting the scary dark, put up the dough and buy another light made for the purpose. But buy this one, too.

I particularly like the zoom lens, where you can instantly narrow or widen the field of illumination. Giving 4s to water resistance and battery life because I've not run out of power since first loading the AAA batteries nor have fallen into the river with the light-- so I really can't judge yet on those two items.  I am fortunate to live in a location and era where, at home anyway, you don't often need light in addition what your local power company provides.

Bought a pair of these in Jan 2019. Price at the time was around $17/pair. Nicely packaged and surprised it came with 2 carry pouches - nice. Out of the box i noticed the lens bezel was loose so i just snugged it on and moved right along. Really nice zoom in feature. I didn't even know they have different modes light control until later. I have dropped the flashlight (accidentally)  from 8 ft directly to concrete a number of times and it handled it well.  One first unit the lens bezel continued to loosen and finally was lost. The lens is attached to the bezel and without it you have an open led board and no focus control.  NOTE: place a drop of silicone on the tread of the bezel and screw it back on - problem fixed. So one to the second unit. About 4 months in the push button control got spongy and actually retracted into the main body. I opened the body (same as replacing batteries) and the switch assembly had come apart and the tiny spring flew away to wherever it is that lost sock from the clothes dryer goes. So i checked my warranty. 1 year no questions asked. I contacted the manufacturer, sent them an email from their website explaining what had happened. Next day i received a return email apologizing for the flaws and they said a replacement will be sent out shortly. By the end of the week I received a new box containing the pair of flashlights. No game of returning the old pair, pay for shipping, blah, blah, blah.  Customer service stepped up - no hassles.  So for that they get a 5 star rating.

For $8 each you can have a pair of tiny flashlights that have a blinding bright true white, take a single lithium battery (or 3 AAA), can be focused or defocused, and are built like tanks!  Compare that to the past and I shutter.3/2020 - Well, I knocked off one star because eventually, BOTH units started to switch off and on and between lighting modes by simply shaking the body.  In fact, moving the body quite normally with the 16850 installed (with plastic fitting sleeve) resulted in the light switch on, off, and among the other modes.  I was about ready to throw them both away but figured I should at least try a contact cleaner on the screw-on back battery post.  Using a product called DetoxIT, I found the battery contact, as well as the aluminum threads, were very dirty.  These flashlights were not even brought outside once either, so I guarantee you WILL need to clean the contacts and threads if you intend to use these past the first-year honeymoon period.  Actually, the contacts should be gold-plated, but this was a corner they understandably cut.  I guarantee that 99% of the people writing these reviews judged their flashlights in the first year or two before the contacts become too dirty for reliable use.8/2020 - I'm taking off one more stars.  The cleaning did not last more than a few months, and the flashlights started to change modes again with shaking.  I use a 18650 battery, and I think I found out the problem: it seems a slight intend of the positive terminal and minor tarnishing of the battery is causing lose contact with the battery.  The problem I have with that is that I've used those batters for many years, and it is not uncommon for them to have some degree of denting in the positive terminal after a while (in fact the flashlight itself might be making the dent).  No other device (ex. my vape) has a problem with the positive terminal not being absolutely perfectly brand new, so this flashlight shouldn't either.  I cleaned the positive battery terminal with DetoxIT, and the flashlight works even with the very slight dent on the positive terminal.  Look they need to put in either better springs, a better positive contact, or something else entirely so the flashlight is not so hypersensitive to stuff like this.  I should not have to specially clean my batteries and the flashlight contacts inside to get it to work.  A simple gold coating on the battery contacts (like other devices often have) would fix all this, but they were too cheap to put it on there.  I'd suggest raising the price of the flashlight by 50 cents to coat the contacts with gold like everyone else does!",Little hard to believe how far flashlights have gone but you MUST clean the contacts sometimes,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

I have another similar flashlight that's a bit brighter than this one, but the zoom function is stiff and jerky, and if anything, for my purposes (searching through our video discs during the evening) it is actually too bright.Here are the things I like about this flashlight. First, it is compatible with a single BRC 18650 rechargeable battery.  Though it comes with a module that you can load three triple-As into, I just tossed out three other LED flashlights that I loved because just such modules were producing nothing but frustration for me as they failed to provide power when I needed it. Think about it...Instead of two connections on a single battery, you have eight aging, corroding connections, and if the path is interrupted at any point, a satisfying beam of light is replaced by an oath in darkness when the switch is depressed.OK, that was the major factor that motivated my purchase. The other things; the SOS flash and the strobe feature are fun, but probably have little practical use in my setting. Too small to be used as a club, it might provide significant reinforcement to a fist, or hit 'em in the face with the crenelated ring surrounding the lens. That edge is like a cookie cutter! The beam is very bright, and directed into the eyes of a predator lurking in a dark place would likely blind them long enough for you to get a good head start making your getaway if you're quick.The compactness makes it handy to carry in pocket or purse so you have a real, powerful flashlight, not a puny little pen light.  The hole in the butt end where the lanyard mounts could also be used to attach a chain if you wanted to hang it in some handy spot.  I cannot speak to the durability of the light at this point, but the body is metal, the battery compartment unscrews and reattaches easily, and the item feels good in my hands; well made.","Well made, reliable performance",Verified Purchase,19 people found this helpful

Needless to say i was reluctant to open the door, so I shined the flashlight through the back door all over the yard first. It lit every  corner of the yard. Didn't see anything or anybody, so I felt OK to take the dog out, but I kept scanning the yard to make sure. It was probably just a rogue possum or something.

It can be held in one hand, secured with the hand strap to prevent dropping it, and easily operated by only one hand thereby leaving the other hand for other actions.  The unit also has a SOS flashing feature which suggests that one of the units would be perfect for leaving in one's car.

The gearlight also has a number of settings including a morse code SOS setting that would be wonderful if anyone still knew morse code.

I'd estimate 4-5 hours or usable brightness on high before needing to recharge. Incidentally the Quantum 588 lumen draws 3A.This is a more conservative power draw than the cheaper T6 multi-packs elsewhere on Amazon or EB that draw 1.6A with less light output. Light also doesn't heat up as much as the cheaper units.Tube interior diameter is 23.2mm so will accommodate 18650 or 20650 cells flat or button top since there's a spring on the + terminal. The manufacturer stresses the need to use a protected cell as their products are directly driven and can use rechargeable or alkaline batteries with the included carrier, plastic battery spacer tube also included for 18650's .The LED retainer appears to be anodized aluminum not cheap plastic as on other lights.

I guess they're OK in a pinch and they certainly don't take up much room in a drawer but they're maybe 5-6 inches long.  I'm gonna leave them around the house in case of a power outage - keep me from stumbling around in the dark.  If you're looking for a real flashlight - keep looking.,"So, pay attention",Verified Purchase,

It's really bright and the battery seems to last pretty long. It also gives you two options on what to power it with. It comes with an adapter for 3 AAA batteries or one big battery that I don't know the name of. I opted for the big battery. Works great,Awesome flash light!,Verified Purchase,

Overall they work excellent, until one night they are left out in the rain and now there is condensation inside the lens of the flashlight. It still works but now it isn't as bright as it was and is like the other flashlights we have.

Don't get me wrong they work well - I was just expecting a light up the heavens and earth flashlight but it fell short of those expectations! The light comes with battery holders but no batteries of any kind. I assumed it came with the rechargeable batteries and the holder for Alkaline batteries but alas...No batteries at all. One of the lights I ordered did not work but I contacted them and they shipped a new one immediately and required no return of the non-working unit.

Strobe is great, the light is very bright, and it is small and easy to carry. I bought it because we have a very large resident black bear in our area that frequently passes through our yard.

The beam is very bright and a plus is that the beam can be zoomed on for greater concentration of brightness. I'm only using the AAA battery option.. I have not tried the lithium battery option because I'm afraid of it possibly exploding. I have not had a chance to test it underwater but I'm hoping it holds up. Finally, having two flashlights is a plus. I would definitely buy this product again.",Excellent..performs as advertised,Verified Purchase,
