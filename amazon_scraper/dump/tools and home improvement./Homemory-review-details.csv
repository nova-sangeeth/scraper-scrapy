Cheapest looking construction, very similar to #7.3. FAVORITE and closest to what a real tea light is. This is what I will keep and buy more of as it is bright and most resembling a candle.4. Greenish hue and different shades. Inconsistency overpowered potential.5. Rather cool white, but nice and bright with a handy remote. They have an option for ""Amber"" color which I bet will be more yellow than the true tea light and what I'm looking for, but good looking nonetheless (hence the higher price). If you want a bright candle with a little cooler white than a real tea light, this is not far off and second favorite.6. Very orange but for a Halloween maybe that's what you're looking for...7.

It's very nearly exactly that. The size, light output, and look of these things is excellent. Unfortunately, the light they give off is WAY too blue to look like a candle light. Instead of warming up the room's mood like a candle does, it gives off a slightly cold-looking light. They're otherwise great little lights, but if you're looking to set an intimate or romantic mood, I'd suggest shopping around for something a little warmer.UPDATE: In the event you do want to order these, here's a quick hack that might improve the quality of the light. I took an orange permanent marker, and inked over the ""flame"" with a single coat,  let it dry for a few moments, then wiped off the excess. The light is much warmer in tone now.
