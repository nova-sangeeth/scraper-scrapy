The Glocusent is BY FAR the nicest. First,  when you put it around your neck, it's practically weightless. The other two had two double A batteries that sat on the back of my neck. Also, the way the arms lay, they automatically light up what I'm working on (I knit). At first I thought the arms were short & wouldn't be bright enough to reach where I hold my knitting. But that's not the case. The lighting is excellent. I like that the arms are short as one of my other lights has long arms & it's a pain to bend them up to light my knitting where I hold my work. And the others somehow shift as I'm knitting. These don't.  I like that they are rechargeable.  The adapter is a 'C', just like my Android phone which is handy. It comes with a cord. I use my own plug in adapter. I am so pleasantly surprised by these, I'm going to buy a back up & two more for my knitting friends as gifts.  I can't get over the quality of the illumination.  I can't comment on the battery life yet as this is the first time I'm using these. I wanted to get a review out right away. You will be happy with these. They look & feel well made. There is a small user manual. It explains the 3 lighting options. It says battery working time is 6-80 hours depending on mode & brightness. My husband likes to watch TV in our theater with no lights on. These are a lifesaver in that I can get knitting done in the dark. This light seems to concentrate the light so as not to be a bother to others nearby. Will test that when I get home & in the theater. Overall. I love this neck light. It's the nicest I've seen.",Best Neck Reading Light,Color: GreyVerified Purchase,274 people found this helpful

The independent lights adjust nicely and I really liked the feature of variable brightness levels. It folded nicely to fit in my backpack and is lightweight.HOWEVER, the description says that it charges on a USB-C port. This is not true. Most of my devices are USB-C, so I have a number of cables, most of which are OEM (not after-market). NONE of my USB-C cables worked on this device! I had to use the cable that came with the device.

I'm used to a little light that clips on my book and that's it, but I was tired of the batteries dying. There are plenty of rechargeable lights, but I am more than satisfied with this one. What a cool light! And useful! I chose this because I write and like to do projects with my hands, no matter the amount of light. It's a bit bigger than I expected (see pic of my hand, though I do have small hands) and the grey is darker than the pictures made it seem (probably a different color manufacturer or whatever), but that's the only critique. It's bendable more than one could need, very sleek, very light, I don't even feel the weight on my shoulders, the lights are controlled separately (and one provides plenty of light for reading), has 3 settings for each light, it uses an included USB-C charger (wow), and comes in nice packaging with a little card from the small new company, just to say hello.

The light is very directed the light does not spillover to a person sleeping next to you, which is a great feature. I am very glad this has 3 settings the lowest setting is great for reading at night, and highest i quite bright. We had a gutter pipe slide off during the night in rain storm and I put these on and we could see everything clear as day and slide the gutter spout back in place. It turns for to be great for fixing things under cabinets/sinks, or reaching dark spots that are hard to see. I use these for all kinds of weird things I did not expect to. So for that these have been better than expected.However, for reading at night or sometimes doing needlework it is a little tricky to get them angled just right, and I wish they were a bit tighter around my neck so they did not slip, perhaps a man would have less of an issue with this and you can not expect the company to make them in sizes.

You need both hands to adjust the lights and turn on/off. This is inconvenient  when you are working on something  with your hands.Secondly, the device slides around my neck a bit and I wish it had included a tie to hold the two sides in place like what you see in some of the other designs.

It has three brightness levels and three color levels.  All work well.The bad news: I have migrated to USB-C chargers and bought this device specifically because it was advertised as USB Type-C.  However, I tried multiple OEM certified USB-C chargers and USB-C to USB-C cables; when plugged in, none of these would power the device (see video/photos).  The device comes with an included cable which appears to be USB-C on one end, but actually plugs into a USB-A charger on the other end.  This included cable is the only thing that would successfully charge the device.If you are choosing this model because it is USB-C, then don't.  It will not work with normal USB chargers and cables, and will require you to travel with a USB-A wall charger in order to accommodate the included cable.  If you don't mind using a USB-A charger, this device will likely work well for you with the included proprietary cable.In the end, I tried three of these neck reading lights: Frishare, Glocusent (this one), and Vekkia.  Of those three, I'm keeping the Vekkia.The Frishare one is relatively light weight, the lights work well as advertised, and it comes with a nice hardened case, which is really it's primary benefit.  However, the rubber arms are thicker than other models and it is a bit bulkier.  Moreover, when you bend the flexible arms I immediately could see the rubber pull off of the battery casing, making the wiring visible (see photo).As noted above, I tried the Glocusent.  It worked well but had two main problems.  It is less flexible with a bigger battery pack in the back, and it doesn't work with USB-C chargers (see above).In the end I settled for the Vekkia neck light.  It is light weight with thinner arms than the Frishare.  Admittedly all of them are cheap lights, but the Vekkia appears better made at first glance, given that the Frishare had exposed wires.  The Vekkia charged fine with my own USB-C to micro-USB cables.  The lowest brightness setting on the Vekkia is also lower than the Frishare or Glocusent, meaning you have the option of less light when your spouse is sleeping.","Won't charge with USB-C charger, only with included cable.",Color: GreyVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

Lights that clip on to your reading material are a pain and won't work on a flimsy magazine or paper.  This device is comfortable to wear, highly aim-able, adjustable in brightness, and even offers some choices for light color.  Great!I tend to wake up earlier than my girlfriend.  When we stay in a hotel room and I wake up early, I can't turn on a light to read or work without disturbing her.  This device solves that problem.  And it is going to have a place right next to my noise canceling headphones for airplane travel.  But therein lies problem number one.The device has very nice, separate power buttons on the outer surface of each light.  The buttons respond to a very light touch.  If the device is packed in a suitcase or carry-on bag where it can come into contact with any other object, those lights are going to turn on and run down the battery.  It needs a master power slide switch for travel.  Otherwise, it must be carted around in the open and I am not enough of a nerd to walk around with a reading light around my neck all the time.The second inconvenience is the proprietary charging cable.

The different levels of brightness and the three different light modes are great and it is fairly bendable so that you can adjust the angle that you need the light to be directed. However, it fits very loosely around my neck and I am not able to bend it to fit close enough so that it doesn't move around if I move while wearing it. It would be impossible to exercise while wearing it. It would bounce around way too much and it is not lightweight enough for that to be bearable.It also is pretty uncomfortable at the back against the nape of the neck which was disappointing because I read plenty of positive reviews saying differently. It fits too loosely and it is extremely bulky in the back so lying down while wearing it isn't comfortable at all.I am a petite female so it is possible that I am experiencing discomfort with it where other people wouldn't. I'd imagine that it fits more snug around bigger individuals. That being said, if they had a smaller size (maybe made for an older child?), it would have been much better. As far as the bulky part that goes at the back of the neck, I can't imagine that even a smaller size would be better for that. It is too uncomfortable to lie down to read while wearing even when trying to adjust with pillows. Consequently, I will be keeping my eyes open for a different product because using it to read while in bed was my main reason for buying it and I just couldn't make it more comfortable no matter how I tried. The design needs to be made more flat at the back of the neck. Even if that means moving the charging port to a different location on the device.

I noticed the light on the device was GREEN, which indicated ""already charged"", so... I began to use it that night. Worked great, FOR LESS THAN A MONTH, & during that month, I noticed the lights would blink on and off occasionally! Thought it WAS ME! The lights began to BLINK/TURNED OFF ENTIRELY just last night & would NOT turn back on, (of course) NOW that the ""window"" of ""RETURN"" time IS CLOSED! I ONLY used this less than five times for a short duration of time each time (seller CLAIMS this product provides MANY hours of charge, ESPECIALLY if you use the LOW LIGHT SETTINGS, WHICH I DID!), so I became QUITE concerned that this product IS A FRAUD! I attempted to charge it this morning, even though it seemed that it shouldn't have needed a charge for quite a while, yet. I plugged it in to charge it, and THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN! The CHARGING LIGHT on the GLOCUSENT LIGHT KEPT READING GREEN, AS IF IT WERE ALREADY CHARGED!! I KNOW it DOES NOT WORK, because when it was plugged in, it ALSO kept BLINKING A RED LIGHT, (for A FRACTION of a second), which would indicate that it needed a charge, but the light INSTANTLY KEPT CHANGING BACK TO GREEN, & sometimes A PALE YELLOW!! So....I unplugged the light from charging, and THE GLOCUSENT WAS DEAD/NO CHARGE/POWER/LIGHTS DID NOT WORK AT ALL!!! The ONLY TIME it WOULD WORK, was WHEN IT WAS KEPT PLUGGED IN TO ELECTRICITY/COMPUTER PORT, AT ALL TIMES!! REAL CONVENIENT!! USELESS!! $20 bucks DOWN THE DRAIN!

So then you get really excited to try out those little led ones that clip to the book itself, [ya, they have problems too.] So I'm looking for something along those lines because I really like reading myself into a stuper. I do a search and these pop up. Hmmmm welllll what do I have to lose, I can always send it back.Alright, so here we go. They came in less than 24hrs (perfect). But then I put them to use...unbelievable! They have three setting for the light [daylight, blueish and a easy going amber] and on top of that they have a low, medium and bright on them too. Wasn't hard to hang them around my neck and get them to the right spot where my book was comfortable because they have the ability to bend. Im sold on these but it GETS EVEN BETTER!Last night my son was working on the truck trying to hold a flashlight with one hand or between his shoulder and chin amongst other ways. So I come out in my night gown with my cool book light and offer it up to him. He's upset already with tinting the window now trying to get the whole door put back together and the glass slipping and sliding all over the place...I know some of you girls have the men in your lives doing things like this and more than likely get stuck for hours holding a flashlight. Well this little light is the rescue for all of those events. He didn't want to use them for fear he would mess them up so I stood there with them around my neck focused on where he was working. I first stood facing him and the lights blinded him so I moved to the rear of him, (you would have thought there was a flood light on).So gals, this is a perfect gift for your guy or just anyone needing light and they only have two hands. They are perfect! Great for reading and great of mechanics.  But I'm sure there arenmore uses for them. Wait, there is. If you take walks at night they are great for that too.

The two flexible arms containing the lights are easy to adjust.  Was able to lay back on my pillow and point them directly on the book pages.  Fairly light and stays around the neck without problems.  The lights are selectable for color in three colors. About 3000 K (Warm),  4000 K (Warm White) and 6000 K (fBright White).  The 5000K setting is very bright and I do not expect to use it much for reading.  Could  be used for inspection of small items when needed.  No information on the Lumen rating is provided.  The 1000 mAH battery should be good for quite a few hours depencing on which setting is used.  Each lamp has it own output level button.  I found that only one of the lamps was needed for a paperback size book.  Only one nitpick--the non-slip pad opposite the charging socket had stuck to the plastic shipping cover rather than to the frame.  I put it back in place and hopefully it will stay.In summary, I can highly recommend this device.  It appears well built and duarable as well.

I tried the reading lights that slide into the spine and have a gooseneck light (some hardcovers had indentations along the spine as I progressed through the book); lights that affix to the back of the book (not so great for paperbacks); and I even placed puck lights vertically on the headboard to shine forward as I was reading.If book lights were Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the Glocusent light would be the ""just right"" option. Because it stays on your neck and is easily malleable, you don't have to worry about the type of media you're reading. This things works for hardcovers, softcovers, magazines, etc. The option of selecting between cool and warm light of varying intensity is also a nice option.  No worries about constantly replacing batteries because it charges via a USB C port.

I use it for sewing, reading, and even when I go upstairs at night, I can now shut off my living room light and use this to guide me upstairs. It's also great for any time you need a little extra light such as during home repairs or walking down the hall at night to use the bathroom.  As far as charging the battery/battery life, I cannot comment yet, but I did not charge it right out of the box, and I think it is dimming already after only a few hours use which I am going to attribute to not initially charging it. I may modify my review on battery life if necessary.  I use the brightest white light typically.  In all, I love this lamp and will be giving them out as Christmas gifts this year. UPDATE: battery life about three hours. Frequent recharging needed. Big disappointment. 3 stars because of this.",Great features but needs frequent recharging,Color: GreyVerified Purchase,

The sides are grippy rubber, so they don't slide around; however, they do start to shift slightly to one side after I've been stitching for awhile, but I think that's because of the repetitive one-sided motion.
