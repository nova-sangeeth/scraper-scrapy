Meeks,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHXQBJ33UXM57LZZ6WWI52S2KZIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2018",0,23,https://www.amazon.com/Filtrete-10x20x1-Filter-Living-Purifier/product-reviews/B08KJNRGCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1,4.0 out of 5 stars,"SEE UPDATE BELOWNOTE: I have used these filters for over 7 years Filtrete Clean Living Basic Dust AC Furnace Air Filter, MPR 300, 20 x 25 x 1-Inches, 6-Pack with no problems and I keep my fan on my HVAC on 24/7 which reduces hot/cold spots and results in less dust but it means you have to change your filter more frequently but with 3 dogs in addition to the normal dust/dirt/lint they still last 4-6 weeks easy. I have reviewed other brands for Amazon and none work any better, most worse and no real cost saving on any of them.I was not going to write a review of this but after reading some of the other reviews it seemed like there was a big lack of knowledge about these filters. Let me start with the photos that people have posted (not sure if everyone's page looks like mine, should be off to the right side) and you can see one of the filters shown has a latticework design to hold/support the filter, what you may not realize is that you have essentially blocked at least 10% of your filter with that latticework, another filter shows it torn up and even a glance indicates it was inserted upside down (these filters are 1 way devices, hence the arrows on the sides showing airflow PLUS if inserted correctly the wire mesh would prevent this from happening under any circumstance). I also read about this filter being too hard on a unit... uh this is the bottom line of these filters with the least resistance to airflow and if they are hard on your unit, you may have a cheap unit or a fan about to die. I was particularly boggled by the one where the filter turned black, stopped up and collapsed and the reviewer blamed the filter ....... sounds like some serious and possibly dangerous air quality problems that need attention quickly, this is NOT a filter problem, possibly a furnace problem. As far as the thickness of material used 5 years ago vs what is used today, the thickness means nothing, it is the permeability of the material to block passage of dust/dirt and other things harmful to the unit and yes Virginia they have actually made the filter better over 5 years and probably saved themselves some money in the process. Don't lose sight of the big picture, ""Does it filter as it should and have the strength to hold up?"" the answer is yes, I don't care how much profit they made as long as I can buy them at a fair price in comparison to other filters and they actually do the job they promised to do (also a yes) while meeting the MPR 300 specification which is approximately equivalent to a MERV 7 (still a yes).I should note that several people mentioned the filter ""bowing"" when under pressure, mine stays bowed since I run my fan 24/7 and none have ever failed in 7+ years, it can flex which means it is actually less likely to break apart. The ""bowing"" is not a sign of failure and if it actually did come loose it would mean you have either the wrong size filter or a defective bracket in your unit since the cardboard frame remains rigid.UPDATE:  I needed to add that IF you let your filter go without replacement for much longer than its intended life and it gets so dirty it cannot pass air it can actually bow to the point it can break loose, you have to really ignore it for a LONG time and have enough trash/dirt to prevent airflow, this is a rare occurrence but I thought I should mention it.  These type filters are meant to be replaced on a regular basis.I saw no reason to take a picture of my dirty filter but it catches all the dog hair and during shedding seasons I might have to change it in 4 weeks but usually they last for about 6 weeks, I have another home in the country and those last closer to 8 weeks (which concerns me a bit about air quality in the city).I should mention that if you had your fly-by-night installer put in a ""cheaper than dirt"" system the list of possible problems is endless and they are never going to come back and say ""it was the cheap system I installed"" or ""I installed it incorrectly"" and the filter is always an easy target. Sadly life tends to lean towards the maxim of ""You get what you pay for""Bottom Line: Ignore the horror stories, I have had many talks with several HVAC techs and the one thing they do all agree on is this:Unless you have a real need for high levels of filtering (severe allergy etc) use the filter with the least resistance that will block damaging dirt and dust from your unit (that would be this filter) and any higher level of filtering will probably shorten the life of your unit and can make the likelihood of the unit freezing up in the summer more likely due to reduced airflow over the coils. 4 Stars instead of 5 mainly because the shipping packaging seems to be a crap shoot, most times they arrive perfect but I have had several delivered where the filters were near unusable due to being crushed in a inadequate shipping box that lacked protection.","Ignore Any Horror Stories, Actual Info About This Filter and Filters In General UPDATE APR 2019",Size: 10x20x1Style: Without Air Purifier,"1,177 people found this helpful",4

I have the thermostat set at 69 & the house won't get above 62. I double checked all my windows and doors. I adjusted the thermostat. I was at a loss. As a last ditch effort before an HVAC appointment, I checked the filter (that I had replaced only a few weeks ago) & found it jammed in the furnace, with the wires bowed. When I finally got it out, I saw the filter was damaged and plugging the intake. I replaced it with a different filter and within an hour my house was warm again.

I have bought this brand at different stores and had no problems. This batch I last bought via amazon is horrible quality.

It’s so loud and was waking me up every time the heat would kick on at night. I asked my husband to change the filter because of it and when I got a different filter out of the box I noticed that the filter doesn’t even have consistent coverage with the fibers and that some parts I could see right through! which means it’s not going to filter anything and dust is just going to continue blow around my house and into our faces.

Which at first I thought might not be a good thing but after watching a ton of HVAC youtube videos I found out it's actually a very good thing. The high airflow makes my heat pump operate more efficiently and avoids problems like the coils icing on the heat exchanger. I use my Alexa device to remind me to replace it every month (also super important). That way I'm avoiding the two most common issues with air handlers: dirty filters and filters that restrict airflow. Just wanted to pass what I learned along.

The grating usually prevents the actual filter media from getting pulled towards the blower.These have it the other way and don't use metal.  There's thin strips of plastic every 1/8"" going from one side to the other and the plastic strips appear to be melted to the filter media at every pleat.  The attachment of the plastic strips to the filter media is quite strong in my limited and unscientific tests.  It should work fine but I was confused at first because the air flow arrow on the frame appears to be pointing in the wrong direction compare to every other filter I've ever used, but I'm pretty sure the arrow is correct, this is just a new way of supporting the filter media.Other than that, it's a basic filter.

They work great! The thing to know is that  they are using a new filter support design. Instead of a metal grid on the backside of the filter 3M is using plastic strips on the front side of the filter media. These strips are attached to every pleat every inch or two and will face away from your blower, the airflow arrows are correct on the package. This seems to be the problem some people are having.  If installed backwards the pleats will collapse when the blower comes on and cause airflow problems. Installed correctly the Pleats keep their shape and everything works fine.  I don’t know why they redesigned it I’m sure it’s a money-saving thing but it is what it is. These are still great filters, I will happily reorder these.","Great filter for the money, new support system design (explained).",Size: 16x25x1Style: Without Air PurifierVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,465011

The first thing he asked was if I had changed the filter on a monthly basis. I told him yes and in fact just put a new one in yesterday.The fault was an airflow differential fault so he removed the filter and reset the furnace. Walla the furnace stayed running and warmed the house. So after the furnace kicked off he reinstalled this garbage filter and turned the thermostat up to call for heat again. BANG furnaces kicked off with the airflow differential fault again within a minute!!!Took filter out and it worked perfect again. He went back to his shop and picked up the correct size filter and tried it again. Worked fine!Long story short he said these filters restrict the airflow too much for high efficiency furnaces.

Also, as it pulls in the sides, it creates gaps for airflow that dramatically increase the sound of the unit by creating a high pitched screaming whistle. We almost called a repair person out to look at the unit until we discovered we could eliminate the sound by taking out the filter.I figured perhaps the first one was a fluke bad filter, but this is not the case.

Considering this is a fairly large size filter, the pressure created by air flow, especially after some dust build up, will be quite a bit. The one I replaced, which is also a 3M, did have solid steel wire backbone.Maybe it was my bad luck. Out of six, there was one was the side squeezed and distorted. This will cause air leak through without filtering. Another reason I was disappointed that 3M removed the steel wire support at the back. With the steel wire support, this won't happen.This is certainly one of the cheaper ones made by 3M, so probably I got what I paid for.",no steel wire support anymore,Size: 24x24x1Style: Without Air PurifierVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,62589354

I always read the worst reviews first to see what people complain about before making a decision. In this case, I made the right decision. One complaint was that these filters came damaged; mine were sent inside three tight boxes, and although they're packaged six together, this is not a problem because I put the unused ones back into one of the boxes. Another complaint was that these filters were flimsy, so much so that they got sucked up by their HVAC unit; I found these GM Filtrate filters to be as sturdy as any other, including Honeywell, even though they did not have cross-beams on the outside (perhaps larger ones than 16x20x1 would get sucked up in a furnace; my house uses these filters in the wall, not the furnace, which has its own filter installed by our HVAC company). Yet another complaint was that filters with high MERVs were so thick that they stopped the air flow, and their HVAC unit strained to circulate air; I got just the right MERV with this product, including some allergen and pollen protection--but not too much/too high as to impede airflow.  I made the right decision, and am extremely happy with this product. Given the number of opinions out there, I wanted people to know my experience. I will buy and use these GM Filtrate filters for the life of the house (or me, which ever dies first :).

My furnace appears to be such a furnace.  The place you put the filter in is not an air tight seal.  That being said, filters that can stop dust, dirt, hair and other particles from getting into your units but still have decent air flow can help prolong the life of your system.  Since my furnace is still running like an absolute champ 20 years later, this must count for something.Anyway, the filters seem to work just fine, though the recent change in the product has me a little concerned since the firm metal backing now seems to be replaced with hot glue gun strands.

This is unusual, and I have never experienced problems before, but these were serious.With nothing else changing, I used the first of six filters, and in a little over a month, my AC condenser unit (the outside part) froze up.  That usually is caused by air flow inside being low, and that's caused by a clogged filter. Sure enough, I changed the filter and that fixed it. Same thing happened again a month later. Now I've been in this house for 6 years and routinely get 3 to 4  months without any problems, changing filters because I remember to. I cheaper out on these new ones, and regret it. For whatever reason, the material these are made of is easily restricted and really reduces air flow. Nothing else changed, no contsruction dust, dirt etc.I would not recommend these at all.  I've switched back to a better filter, the next step up like a MERV 10 or better (these are 5 which is marginal at best) and with that step up the filter material is significantly higher quality.

We are going to need them to run our A/C until an alternative filter is delivered..,Poor Quality,Size: 12x20x1Style: Without Air PurifierVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,9201594

I noticed Airflow Arrow pointing at wrong direction. I was little confused. Plastic grid designed to hold the filter back but if we followed the airflow arrow it is not helping. There are many others saying the same thing. So BE AWARE. I am going to use the filter anyway but will install the filter opposite way of the airflow arrow show.,Airflow Arrow point at wrong direction.,Size: 16x25x1Style: Without Air PurifierVerified Purchase,,78773175
