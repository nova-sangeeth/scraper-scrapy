I know that some reviews said that they gave these tools to their kids to play with, but I really hope they were joking. This tool kit is NOT for children. The tools are sharp and the hammer is heavy enough to do serious damage when swung like any other hammer. Anyway, I use the tools to hang things and assemble small furniture pieces. I hate going into the garage in the hopes that my husband put the hammer back in the same drawer. This kit is very light and convenient to me.Edit: After about a year of use, the magnet in the screw driver came loose and fell out. I messaged  the seller about any ways to get a replacement magnet, but did not hear anything back. Then one day there was a package at my door with a totally new kit! I had initially gave four stars because my first case did not close and I just used another bag. However, this new case actually closes and all the tools seem to stay put. Thanks for the service!

Can't say I would really recommend this to anyone. The tools feel and look very cheap, which was to be somewhat expected, however, there are multiple issues right out of the box.The first of which was the measuring tape -- Pulling beyond 1 - 2 feet made the mechanism get stuck and I could not retract the tape, even trying to push it back in or pulling more out. It's an overall design flaw. Could just be my set but it made it inoperable.Secondly the scissors looked to have been used, the metal within the blade had scratch marks...The hammer's handle is rotated slightly which makes gripping seem a little awkward and the latches for the tool box are not comfortable to handle and not smooth at all. I'd honestly wouldn't even gift this to anyone, it would be kind of embarrassing.
