There was an older version of this game at a beach condo we rented for a week, and the whole family liked to play so we decided to buy it.  Just like the older version there are 72 thick cardboard characters, however this particular version my kids have figured out that if they look from the side of the card they can see the colors on the side that is facing down!!  Makes it very easy to find the matches!! So instead of using their memory as intended, they look for the color. So because of this I have knocked off a couple stars.","Kids love, but major design flaw",Style: Disney Classic MatchingVerified Purchase,45 people found this helpful,29899014,,,

But this set was thick and cardboard-like just the way we prefer them. Blew my mind how high quality it was for such a low cost. Another good thing about it is there’s a huge variety in colors/pictures/themes on the cards which makes it easier and more fun to play. We’ve had sets (worst case being the Minnie Mouse set) where there’d be a bunch of pairs that were super close in appearance to one another, just with minor changes that are barely noticeable. The sets like that are so much harder for kids and way less fun. This set actually had a huge variety, none of the cards looked the same. There’s cards with single characters, character pairs, animals, symbols, snowflakes, child versions of the characters, etc in all different shades and colors and themes. Very easy for kids to play.

While my granddaughter is much too young to play, my grandson is having a lot of fun with these.  He is just getting introduced to a number of the classic characters whose pictures are on the cards and this helps him to remember their names as well as serving a great function in memory and visual recognition.I found the full set to be a little too much for him to deal with at his age, so I separated them into small sets that I keep in zip bags in the box.  He chooses which set to play with and we work those cards only.  As he gets older, I will combine the sets together until we are working the whole box.  Having several smaller sets to work with right now makes the value of the set even more appealing to me.He loves it when he matches the cards and we all applaud.  The cards themselves are nice and sturdy and the graphics are very well done.

She surprised my Mom enough to post about it. The tricky part was keeping her attention when it was my turn so that she remembered what I had flipped over. There are so many characters in this game that you you have to have almost every Disney movie for your child to know every character. The game is simple, teaches memory skills, and is a great laugh when your child makes up names for characters. Mine started calling Dopey from Snow White, ""Backwash"".The only issue is in packaging and we had to find some rubber bands to group the tiles together as it takes a while to start because you have to collect and match all the tiles before setting up the game. You can get this type of game on your iPad or phone but this is a cheap and easy way to get the kid's eyes off a screen for a while. Plus it is easy to pack up and play anywhere. You can make it as easy or as hard as you want by controlling the number of matches you play at a time. My three year old can do 16 tiles well and begins to struggle when I increase it to more than 20. After about three rounds the attention span begins to waver.I recommend this game for it's high educational value, ease of use and adaptability to various skill levels.","Quick, educational and not a computer game",Style: Disney Classic Matching,5 people found this helpful,2371713,,,

There are TONS of cards, but before we play, I take out an appropriate number of matches for him, usually ten to twelve. So, it's very easy to customize the game according to your child's attention span. It's a lot of fun, if you have a tiny Marvel fan I am sure he or she would love it!","Simple, Fun Matching Game.

I was excited when I found this game and I liked the idea of a generic Disney memory game vs. a specific character like Doc McStuffins or Jake and the Neverland Pirates. I have read reviews before on other matching games and the main complaint was that with specific themed games like Doc McStuffins, Princesses etc there were only so many characters and they were repeated on a lot of the cards (different poses, same princess) and that was confusing to children. When I came across this game I bought it due to the enormous number of Disney characters available, I figured no repeats and a lot of variety. Boy was I wrong. There are 18 different characters with each character's picture on 4 cards making 2 sets. I read some reviews which complained about no classic characters like Mickey, maybe I have a newer set but mine does contain a Mickey.The Characters are:Jiminy CricketLady and TrampNemoPoohPatch (101 Dalmatians)DumboFlounder (The Little Mermaid)Flower (Bambi)Marie (The Aristocrats)Baloo (The Jungle Book)BambiThe Cheshire Cat (Alice In Wonderland)Pumba and Timon (The Lion King)MickeyTiggerThumper (Bambi)Simba (The Lion King)Sebastian (The Little Mermaid)My daughter is 2 1/2 so this actually is probably a good thing that there is not a lot of variety as to make it too confusing. I know friends who have Memory games and they have to take out some of the cards because it is just too many for a toddler. This box is rated 3+ preschool so that is probably why there are duplicates and not a lot of variety. I just don't like the fact that I will possibly have to buy another set for when she gets older with more cards to match. My only other complaint is there is not a princess in the set. The makers of this game also went heavy on Bambi, with three characters represented from this film. Take one out and add a princess please. Finally, as other reviewers have said BUY THIS AT TARGET (or possibly Walmart). I paid less than 5.00 for this at Target and it is 12 on Amazon.",Torn about this product.,Style: Disney Classic Matching,14 people found this helpful,2221378,331,118,Public

The cards are thick and durable and all the photos on them are so bright and colorful.I love that it's educational in that it helps with critical thinking and memory. You can also use it to teach color recognition and use the cards to count. It's so refreshing to have a game that isn't inundated with noises and lights and that requires the child to concentrate to find the match. I also like that we can also practice taking turns with this game. Also, I can customize the game for her age level and decide how many matches I want to put out for her, like 6 pairs to find, so I can gradually make it more challenging for her.
