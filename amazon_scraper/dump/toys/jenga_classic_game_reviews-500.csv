If the tower falls apart on your turn, you will lose the game. It is very simple and fun game.If you're looking for a game as described above, then you can't go wrong with this product. Amazon delivered it in timely fashion as usual, and the product is exactly what you would expect–a bunch of wooden blocks that you can use to build a tower. Also, this comes with game instructions and some kind of stacking aid made out of carton. I tossed the stacking aid to trash, since I find it to be much faster to build the tower by hand without the aid.In my opinion, the game is at its best when played with two people, but there's no limit of how many people can participate in the game. I would recommend using a stable table to play the game on, but a dangling Ikea table (or equivalent) surely adds some challenge.In a good company this game is much more fun than any video game on the market, making it a bargain at less than $10. This game will also work anywhere with decent gravity–as long as you are able to find a stable surface. In conclusion, I would recommend Jenga to anyone living on a planet that has a sufficient gravitational force to hold the tower together on the surface, which includes all the areas to which Amazon.com delivers.",No HDMI Cable Required,Size: ClassicVerified Purchase,94 people found this helpful,447,127,846981,Public

It's a game you can play with just about anyone, and although it does take some concentration when you're the one pulling out that precarious block, you can still converse and cavort while playing (as long as you've got the game on a stable surface!).Jenga also helps teach hand-eye coordination, precision, patience, forethought (""what will happen if I pull out this block?""), and just a bit of physics -- some of the blocks are rougher, some are smoother, so friction comes into play.I highly recommend this game to everyone, regardless of age!",Love it,Size: ClassicVerified Purchase,22 people found this helpful,44,80,1784118,Public

My brother, sister, and I played this game rather peacefully for at least an hour at a time. My mom would play it with us. Occasionally even my dad, and he hates games. It's a great solo toy, too, for the little ones who like to build. And while you could hide those markers, what will be more fun in 20 years? A perfect vintage Jenga set? Or one that your children ""decorated"" as toddlers? Maybe you should just put some nice markers in your cart while you're at it.I'm all nostalgic about this one, but more than many games and toys of my childhood, I believe this one is still worth playing (which is why I now have my own set). You don't plug it in. It doesn't have any lights, bells, buzzers, or whistles. There's no robot, no artificial intelligence, and not a darn thing anyone can control with their smartphone.

But as other reviews have stated, the packaging sucks, and I give it 3 stars.  For an overall rating of 4 stars. The problem comes when you want to store the blocks.  You have two trains of thought here.  Save the time of stacking them nicely when you are done, by just throwing them all in the box, and then set them up when you want to play next, OR stack them neatly in the box when you're done, so you don't have to set them up when you want to play next, because you can just slide them out of the box, ready to play.  Either of those options means you only have to stack them nicely once.You can't do EITHER with this packaging.  We tried the first scenario, just throwing them all in the over-sized rectangular box, thinking that must be why it's bigger, so it can accommodate all of the blocks when they're not stacked up nicely.  NOPE.  They won't fit if you just throw them all in.  Ok, not a problem, we'll just stack them neatly in the cardboard corner guide they give you and put them in.  While that will allow you to fit all the blocks in the box, there is nothing inside to hold them together, so they all fall apart anyway as soon as you move the box to a shelf and you have to set them up again when you want to play again!  So when you put them away, you have to stack them nicely, and then when you want to play, you have to stack them AGAIN before playing.  I mean you could solve this by either 1. Make the box square, so the blocks don't come apart in the box, or 2. Make the box big enough to accommodate all the blocks when they are just thrown in randomly.  There could be a 3rd option, which would be to just get a big gallon size ziplock bag, they might all fit in there.  However, then you have no place to store the cardboard sleeve which acts as a guide when setting them up.  You just can't win. Packaging fail.TL;DR The game is fine, but putting them away and setting them up sucks purely because of the packaging.Rant over.","Game, 5star, Packaging 3",Size: ClassicVerified Purchase,,56,31,2661563,Public

Oddly, however, this comes in a box that is not the same size as the game so you can't easily store it stacked up in the box. And the thing that is supposed to be used to keep it in shape in between games and to set it up right is no longer hard plastic but cheap cardboard, so it is not going to last very long (with a house full of kids) so there won't be an easy way to re-set the game up without the thing that keeps it i the right shape. Our old Jenga game had a nice plastic thing to keep the shape of the game and then a box that was the size of the game so it could be easily stored in the box in between games. For a game with a million pieces, it makes no sense to not think about how people will store it and set it up. I'm sure it is a cost-saving thing and marketing thing, but if you can buy one with a smaller box so you can easily store it and keep its shape in between games.

I think the wood blocks themselves are quality with smooth, flat surfaces and square edges. However, I expected to be able to stack the tower back into the box when the game is not in use. The description says it includes a stacking sleeve--which I didn't see the kids open the game so I don't know exactly what was in the rectangular retail package but packaging/stacking sleeve is lacking in my opinion. There is nothing to help keep the tower square as you stack the blocks into shape. And then you either dump them back into the rectangle-shaped retail package and risk them not all fitting as they pile up haphazardly, or you take the time to stack them knowing the stack won't survive into the correct shape next time you take the blocks out of the package to play. So, I guess that lends itself to the cheaper price.",Wood Blocks are Good--But NO Stacking Assistance,Size: ClassicVerified Purchase,,156,179,248052,Public

The box had an exterior flap with instructions, a plastic sleeve for help in stacking and keeping pieces from falling out of the ""Window"" of the box when the pieces were put inside the box. The interior of the box I was familiar with, helped in that once you stacked the Jenga game with the sleeve, and put it away, it was ready to go next time you were ready to play. Just open the box, gently tip it upside down, remove the box, and the game is stacked and ready to go!This new box, with a copyright of 2012, is wider than the stacked Jenga blocks. Wider, meaning that the box is rectangular. You can no longer stack the blocks, and have them put away, ready to go for next time.When the box arrived to me from Amazon, I had immediate dread when I saw how wide the box was, when I grabbed the box, the edges started to cave in, because there was nothing but dead space on the sides of the box. I was baffled as to why Jenga would be stacked inside with all this dead space. Is this for real?It seems now, that Hasbro doesn't want you to put away the game nicely anymore, rather just throw all the blocks in the box, loose, nothing neat. Then, pretty much anytime you grab the flimsy exterior box, you end up caving it in a bit.The cardboard sleeve replaces the plastic sleeve, and while of a decent thickness of cardboard, it's a definite step-down from the plastic sleeve.I also don't know why Hasbro switched to a box much large than the stacked contents. Most people I know, and knew of, with Jenga had no problems stacking the game pieces and putting them away. Never heard any complaints out of anyone during all these years with Jenga, except when someone accidentally sat on the plastic stacking sleeve that was sitting on a sofa (Clear, easy to miss) and damaged it.My advice is, that if you are familiar with the ""old"" way Jenga was stacked, and packed away, find an older set and buy that. They're out there.",The new box is horrible,Size: ClassicVerified Purchase,17 people found this helpful,1106,599,28356,Public

Well i found this to be true with Jenga..It all starts in the year 2000. It was New Years Eve, and i had been invited to a friends house to celebrate the new year. The night started off normal with drinks, food, and a few good laughs and joke. Then it all began... One of the guys at the party asked if we were interested in playing ""a game"". We all agreed it could be fun, and gathered around the kitchen table. As he placed his backpack on the table I swore i saw a flash of light shining through the zipper. He pulled a dusty old box out, and i could barely make out the lettering J-E-N-G-A.I don't remember much after the wood blocks were setup.. My mind races as i think back to that night.. blackness overcomes my thoughts, with flashbacks filling my memory. My eyes glaze over as i start to remember.  Chanting.. JENGA, JENGA, JENGA, someone running around without any cloths on, the house being set on fire. When i ask my friends what happened that night no one seems to remember. No one remember HIS NAME.Since that night I could never break away from the game. I tried counseling, i tried rehab, but nothing breaks me free. Every second of the day I'm thinking about the block I should of pulled, or the strategies of center block versus end blocks. I've lost my wife, my home, and my job due to these wood demons. I've entered into underground tournaments and lost everything I've ever worked for.But there is good in everything. With the life lessons obtained from this game I was able to escape prison. As I pulled blocks and bricks I had focus that none of the other prisoners had ever seen. I worked with precision and accuracy, allowing myself to escape with the wall caving in on the chasing guards. Three of the guards died, but they can blame that on Jenga.. not me.. It's been almost two years since i've escaped, and I haven't touched the game since.Please pray that I can overcome this madness. My dreams and nightmares revolve around Jenga, and i just hope one day I'll be able to break free.","Life of Jenga, by Matt Dobson",Size: ClassicVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,71,29,2262,Public

Back in the 90s when you bought this the box was the size of the tower and you got a nice plastic sleeve to line things up.  It was durable and lasted a long while.  The new packaging the box is about two inches wider then the stack and the sleeve is cardboard, THIN cardboard.  And if it is messed up (really easy to do) then the two little cardboard blocks will not hold the stack up in the packaging.
