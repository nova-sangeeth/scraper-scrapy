Most cards are funny and potty humor but I’d still not feel comfortable letting my 13 yo play alone with his friends without removing several cards from the deck.On the other hand, my husband and I found the game fun.

There’s still A LOT of suggestive cards, and about a dozen “maybe not” cards that I separated and left in the box labeled (pictured).  I played the whole deck w my 15 yr old and showed it to my 16 yr old - even they were baffled at the “age 8” recommendation - I def won’t play it w my 7 yr old and my husband won’t even consider the game.  There were a couple duplicates, as well.  Overall, it’s mostly potty humor and general things that will just sound funny when you put it with something else. But even after pulling out the dozen cards there’s still some on the gray line. Eg: “where do babies come from” ended up with “turkey baster”, “the circle of trust” and “mom jeans”.  If you’re looking for a clean game for the family, this won’t be it.  I’d say age 10+, after pulling some raunchy inappropriate cards.  Every family is different though.  It satisfies the multigenerational game requirement though, and would say it’s good for ages 10-99 (if grandma and grandpa won’t mind it).",Still not for age 8,Verified Purchase,77 people found this helpful,710588,100,1,Public

All one needs to simply do is load the Urban dictionary and type in a few of the answers that are provided for this game, in doing so you will be appalled at the depravity that the publishers of this game are putting in the hands of children. One reviewer stated they removed one or two cards, I went and removed at least 50. I'm almost embarrassed to list a few of the terms that are on the cards, however, you need to see for yourself. My wife played a card called Mr merkins wig, my children played a card called Pickle Park and Mexican Mudslide, another called dog's lipstick, and yet another one called bat wings and camel toenail. Take some time and look them up for yourself.  If we hadn't already opened and played the game I would have returned it immediately.
