The pages of this book are thin and made of a slick matte material. The pages will be able to withstand both toddler drool and sticky fingers, but they’re also a little slick for a toddler to turn. When grasping a page or turning a page, it’s very easy to touch objects near the edge of the page without even trying. Even using the tabs on the side can be a challenge. If the pages were a tad thicker and the page tabs were a little wider/longer, this book would be awesome.Two: Each page is a different category containing different objects for toddlers to touch. Touching each object invokes a spoken word in English or Spanish. And this book is very responsive to touch - it accommodates even the softest toddler touch, which is a catch-22. Because the objects on each page are close together, if a toddler is using two fingers to touch an object, they may touch a different object or multiple objects at the same time. So when she breaks this book out for the day, we sometimes have to remind her to touch one spot at a time by guiding her hand (using her index finger) so that she’s not touching multiple objects.Three: You should know that this book is pretty loud even on the low setting. My husband actually tried to cover the speaker with some cardboard (haha!), but the sound escapes through the holes in the back of the unit and the cardboard doesn’t make much of a difference. After a few minutes, the low volume sounds almost the same as high volume.",Great!

Hate most of the plastic crap. And the repetition of most kids toys make u crazy. I’m not sure what the one star review is talking about - it does NOt need a computer to work. I can update the review long term for its endurance/longevity. My kiddo’s are 3&1, one talking vigorously and the other learning the language/single words but building her vocabulary. This things is awesome! So easy for the kids to use and learn on their own. The screen yes is very sensitive & responsive but great. Seems like a silly thing to complain about. The kids can easily check their knowledge very easily. I literally want to buy one for every niece & nephew & friend w a toddler - which there is MANY! It’s a great little find from my mother. The device has a system that reads when u turn the page and announces the new subject matter. Me & my doubtful man were immediately impressed. And it does the whole thing in espanol too!

One through a competitor, and once my kids abused it and destroyed it a second one through Amazon. The best positive feedback I can say about it is that after the 1st one broke, I bought it again almost instantly. There are two volume settings (high, low), three play modes and two languages (English, Spanish). My kids, (20 months and 3.5 year old) love this book so much that not re-buying it wasn't an option. The words are indeed age appropriate and the images are colorful and bright. Which leads me to the negatives…The design of it wasn’t the smartest. I’m guessing there are sensors inside the plastic covers that look at one of eight positions. By flipping through the pages, you are flipping at a switch that says which page you are on. The problem is that the front cover was made in a way that it hangs in the air when open, because of that, if a toddler puts some of his/her weight on it, it might damage the connectors. Thus, making half of the book not work. Additionally, the sensors are sensitive enough to read through a bunch of pages, thus they are EXTREMELY sensitive when there are none or few pages between your fingers and the cover.Additional negatives are in the content translations. Most of the words in Spanish are correct, and the sentences and song are enunciated correctly. The problem lies in a few words that they were lazy in finding a word that made sense. For example: they have the clothing piece “shorts” translated as “los shorts”. Really. And that is not the only time they did that. I couldn’t give it five stars because of those issues. So, summarizing:Pros:- Bilingual toy great for toddlers learning words in both English and Spanish.- Bright and colorful pictures- Tons of phrases, songs, words and sentences. With three play modes and two languages.Cons:- Durability is an issue, as the front cover hangs in the air when opened which leads to the sensors being damaged.- The sensors are extremely sensitive to the point that pointing at something in the book two inches away triggers it.- Most of the translations are good but a few are really, REALLY terrible…","If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would. I can't, so is closer to 4 than 3, I guess...",Style: Standard PackagingColor: Learning FriendsVerified Purchase,272 people found this helpful

My only complaint is sometimes when he touches a picture with his finger, the heel of his hand will touch another picture and name that picture instead. Not a big deal, really, but a little annoying. And some of the sounds they selected for the pictures are a little weird, but kind of funny.

This purchase exceeded my expectations in that the voice is a pleasant woman s voice. Usually you never know if it's too robot like which it isn't perfect but it's actually worth it. I am not sure about volume I guess I didn't look into that much since when I tried it it wasn't too low or loud. You want to add some batteries for child to enjoy right after its unwrapped! All tech toys don't include batteries but that was the only downside. Seems durable I got it for a 2 yr old and I am excited to gift and see her learn both languages. Bilingual families this is a must. It is just naming animals and household items but stays relevant to first words and has other features that to me are just a BoNuS!!,Accurate Castilian Spanish book is perfect for bilingual readers!,Style: Standard PackagingColor: Scout and VioletVerified Purchase,

I speak Spanish to her and my SO English, so this is a perfect item to help reinforce words that she knows better in one language or the other.I would much rather rate this 3.5 stars, because I have 2 issues with the book. One, it is very sensitive. If my daughter lightly touches the page to touch a picture it will say the word of the first picture ""touched"". Often times I have to touch the picture she intended to touch for her to hear the proper word. The second issue I have is that some of the sounds made with the pictures don't make sense. For example, the baby bottle is a sound of a baby crying, so my daughter started calling bottles babies. The pony is a sound of a horse's gallop instead of one neighing, which she finds confusing and also a slight let down because I can see she expects the neighs.",Nice interactive bilingual book,Style: Standard PackagingColor: Learning Friends,13 people found this helpful

My children are ages 3 and 5 and I know they will love this book (I am giving it to my youngest next week for her birthday so I did not take it out of the box yet but had fun playing with it - see photos and video). First, I believe this was recently redesigned. It has three learning modes for animal names, fun facts and sounds. My kids will likely not be interested in the fun facts just yet, nor would an 18 month old (the recommended age of this toy) but definitely the names and sounds will be a hit. It plays a few songs and the content is a mixture of real images of animals as well as graphics, which is a good balance for kids learning generalization. I like the organization of the book, with tabs and color coding for the different environments: farm, savanna, desert, polar, ocean, shore, home, garden, rainforest, trees, forest, and forest at night. You can toggle between English and Spanish. And, hallelujah, it has volume control! The handle on top is great for little hands. My only criticism of the book is that some of the animal names are difficult to read, due to the font size and style against the busy background. My 5 year old is working on sight words and early reading, so I wish this had more clear words, but, I realize this was intended for a much younger child, who will likely be more engaged by the images, graphics and sounds. All in all, I love this book! I think the pages are thick enough to withstand harsh page turning (we all know it happens!) but thin enough not to require too much fine motor skills for little hands. I have also ordered the “100 Words book” by LeapFrog because these are so awesome and make learning fun!",Perfect timing for at-home learning!,"Style: Standard PackagingColor: Animals, GreenVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )",

I was especially excited about the animal facts option.The book has six double-sided, interactive pages that features animals from different categories including: farm, forest, desert, ocean, and the shore.There are three different play modes and all are bilingual in English and Spanish. The first mode is the name of the animals that follows with the animal sounds. The second mode is the fun facts and the third is just the animal sounds.It requires 2 AA batteries that are included, but recommended to replace for long-term use.As a book intended for 18 months and older, it might keep their attention for about ten minutes. I was really hoping the section on fun facts would be helpful to my grandson who is 4-years old because Leap Frog states that they are facts that introduce children to science. Well, telling me a giraffe is tall and a fly is small is not very scientific. But to a younger child, it might be interesting.Also, the sound mode is unnecessary. The sounds of the animals are already included in the names of the animals mode.Every page is interactive and touchscreens. There were some glitches if the page did not open all the way. I think this could be an issue with some younger kids. Might be better suited with adult supervision.",Six-page interactive book on animal facts,"Style: Standard PackagingColor: Animals, GreenVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? )",

My daughter really loves to flip through the pages and discover what all the animals sound like. She has actually learned a bear, elephant, cat and dog. She can now imitate the noises that those animals make before she presses on the animals picture. It also has English and Spanish. We are trying our best to teach her spanish as early as possible as well. As Mommy only speaks to her in spanish so that she can communicate with her family in Mexico. My wife really likes that it has spanish also. It has three play modes that teach about animal names, animal sounds and fun facts.

But I bought this home for my younger daughter, who is still a little too young for it, but my oldest daughter is in love with it!  Leap Frog has always made some pretty good quality items, but this book is wonderful!  It is a thick plastic for the outer shell, but it's durable, and the ""pages,"" which are also made of a thin plastic each have tabs on them that are easy for chubby fingers to turn.  Believe me when I say there is no way to tear these pages either.  The pages are also made up of animals one page to vehicles on another, so I like that it has a variety.  As for the sensitivity it's super easy to simply press an item and for the book to say what it is.  My toddler was slow in talking, or lazy, as she can repeat anything you say, but when it comes to a functioning sentence half is still gibberish, and this has actually helped a lot.  I have noticed her talking more in full sentences, and ""teaching"" her younger sister.  No lie.  She'll sit on the floor with her, and tell her the item before pressing it to hear the book read it out to her.  She teaches her baby dolls, her Barbies, and her Build A Bears, and it's hilarious listening to her, as she'll tell them more words that aren't even on the book.  My youngest loves it too just to be able to turn pages, but she likes the sound feature more than the words.  Great little book, and I definitely recommend.

Some of my favorite features:- easy for even the youngest toddlers to use - when the page is flipped it automatically ""reads"" what category is on that page, then when they touch the pictures it reads what they are- I love that it has tiered levels - my daughter loves level 1 where it just says the word to her (names the picture). My older toddler loves level two where it tells you a fun fact about each item. I'm not a huge fan of the 3rd level, which just says sounds it makes - some of the sounds are ridiculous... like what sound does a giraffe make?! And of course the ""nose"" on the ""body part"" page sneezes on that level - which gets lots of laughs. But I guess if the kids like it, it's good with me.- Includes a spanish version if you turn it to ""espanol"". The songs are even translated and sung in spanish.- Includes enough pages to be really engaging and keep their attention for a long time- educational - I love that they're learning more words as they play with this toy- has 2 volume settings (thank you, LeapFrog for the quieter one!)NOTES:- My younger toddler did pinch her fingers pretty hard in the book a few times and cried about it - but I think it's just part of getting used to it (they also usually pinch their fingers in regular board books when learning to turn the pages, too)- the buttons are REALLY sensitive - they touch with just barely a brush - this is good because it makes it easy for little fingers to use, but it also makes them push buttons on the opposite page with the hand they're just holding it with and not tapping - the kiddos didn't seem to mind, though.",GREAT for a road trip,Style: Standard PackagingColor: Learning FriendsVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? ),One person found this helpful

Built with three modes (words, sounds, and search) combined with English and Spanish give six outputs per button. The improves the ""replayability"" of this toy. Logical groupings of common objects means there is both familiarity with some items on the page, and exposure to other items in the same category. Great for expanding a vocabulary that already has a few key words, or establishing new vocabulary.Design: Excellent, with a few flaws. There are adult switches, kid switches, kid buttons, and ""device buttons"" that are all cleverly placed so that this product feels like a coordinated toy. Buttons in the spine are used to ""switch pages"", which streamlines page turning, and allows each page to be made of a thin-ish flexible plastic that is durable. Each page shares its buttons/contact points with other pages, which is good and bad. Book must be used laying mostly flat, trying to hold the book and use it at the same time would be too difficult for most toddlers I think. The buttons themselves are no-travel pressure sensors, durable, no moving parts, and they are very easily pressed, even through the plastic pages. Well suited to the strength of a little one. Simplified hardware means less to break, but if the ""left page"" or ""right page"" DOES break, it is broken for ALL left or right pages. This happened to my device. All of the pages on the left just stopped working after less than 2 hrs of play. The other page, and all other functions continued to work, so it still ""worked"" for the kid. Having some electronic repair experience, I decided to try to fix it myself. Long story short, there is a poorly designed contact point inside. To ""fix""it, I had to open up the device and re-align the ribbon cable. 10 minutes of effort and it was good as new. Bonus points for using two AA batteries, as dithium crystals are not a fisible option. (See what I did there? fisible≠feasible, I digress) The volume IS adjustible, and has three volume settings: off, ten, and eleven. Would not recommend for a travel companion, unless you and everyone else travelling are deaf, then I don't think anyone would mind. Pages are waterproof, but the device is not submersible, nor does it function as a submersible, BUT there IS a submarine IN the book, so there's that.

I deducted a star because they are almost too reponsive, for example when he tries to touch a picture with his finger and the back of his hand brushes against something it will play the sound for the object his hand brushed up against and the one his finger touched, making it confusing for the child about what sound goes with which picture.
