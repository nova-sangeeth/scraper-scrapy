Game. Ever.I have two daughters, one whom has Apraxia of speech and the other who is a beginning reader. The pictures ensure that my younger daughter (with Apraxia) can still independently play, while it encourages both my children to read aloud the object. This game requires no adult help, so my daughters will literally spend hours playing this game together. It is super sturdy game with thick, sturdy, double sided cardboard bingo cards and the text and pictures on the yellow “chips” have no scratching or fading from frequent overuse; we do have problems sticking the discarded yellow chips back in on one side of the Zingo machine if it’s not placed in the slot *just so*, but I’m sure it’s from an overzealous preschooler and not the manufacturer.

They have to use a pincher grip to push it in and there is a little tension so they have to push a little bit. We had to teach them to put them in correctly, but they caught on quick. I am not sure what it is but the act of pushing the game piece in is reinforcing and they love to do it. This is great for my kids who have weakness in their hands. It also helps with motor planning.

We got our first set as a gift. I bought this one as a spare because it was quickly clear that my 4-year-old twins were going to destroy the original set. That's OK. The game held up well, and the tiles are easy for kids to lose. The ""Zinger"" mechanism works very well; we have rarely had problems with it, and it works for the kids playing independently. But the new set came with a couple surprises. It's 7-player, 78-tiles instead of 6-player 72-tiles. So the cards are different, which is a surprise. But not a big problem.What was a surprise is that my new set is short 2 tiles. I got only 76. (If you care to do an inventory, there should be 3 of every tile.)

Not really worth $25.The game has ONLY 24 WORD tiles.  I read in the description that it had 72 tiles, but didn’t realize there are 3 of each (which I understand for the game purpose if you’re playing with multiple people but they need to provide more tiles with more words).My child just completed Kindergarten and they were expected to read a list of 100 words.  He needs more practice on some so a classmate’s parent recommended this game.  But these tiles only represent 1/4 of the words he needs to know to start first grade (and we haven’t played yet for me to see if they are the words he knows already or not...)Also, the cards have TOO MANY PICTURE CLUES.  This makes it easier for the child to use the picture as a reminder/prompt versus truly recall/read the word, which is the point of sight words.  There should be another version on the back of the cards with words only.  This would help because when assessed in Kindergarten they have 3 seconds to read the word to prove they know it (no picture clue or time to sound it out).Another idea would be to sell a “refill kit” if you already have the original Zingo (which we really liked so this is sad!). I keep the tiles in a snack-size zippered plastic bag to prevent them from getting lost, so I could just use the same red dispenser if the refill kit came with tiles and cards only.  This would make the product cheaper and easier to package/ship.  And if they couldn’t add more than 72 tiles in one set, they could offer different refill sets with more words.",Not that useful - Only 24 words & cards have picture clues,Style: Zingo Sight WordsVerified Purchase,15 people found this helpful

My students were on various levels (Pre-K through 2nd) when it came to reading.  One of the most difficult tasks of teaching can be making learning fun.  I found this game on Amazon and thought it might be a good addition to my small group teaching time (after a structured lesson).  The result?  ALL of my students fell in love with this game.  They would often ask to play it during their small group reading time if we had time left at the end of the lesson.  There are two sides to each card; however, even my students who were below grade level could use the ""harder"" side of the card.  The key part of this is to have the students read the word (or try to read the word) before getting the word chip.  Even though they are sight words I found it essential to help the student try to figure out the word to ensure success.  Rather than only get three in a row I often played the game where the entire card had to be filled.  At the end of the game I would always reward the students with a pencil, eraser, ticket, etc... whether or not they won.  That avoided anybody feeling like they lost.  It didn't ever delete the motivation to play because each student still wanted to win.If you want to make learning fun, try this game.",My Students LOVED This Game,Style: Zingo Sight WordsVerified Purchase,85 people found this helpful

When I saw that there was a word building version, we had to have it for her as well.  There's no setup required like punching out pieces or assembling anything, it's ready to go when you take it out of the box.  I like that there are two sides to the cards so younger children can play the easy side and older children and adults can play the harder side to make play a little more evenly matched.  The tiles are sturdy plastic so you don't have to worry about them bending them or ruining them by getting them wet or anything, plus they're double sided, so no need to put them into the Zinger 'right side up'.  The letters on the tiles and cards are also colored red for vowels and black for consonants.  This makes it easy to explain to younger kids that on the 'easy' side of the cards, you need 2 black letters and 1 red letter for each word.  The 'Zinger' is the hard plastic house that the tiles live in and are dispensed from.  The top slides easily forward and back to drop two tiles into the little grooves each time.  Then you slide the tiles back into as lot in the top if not needed with a satisfying little click sound.  Another nice feature is all the pieces fit easily back in the sturdy game box without taking anything apart!

They like sliding the word dispenser and popping the plastic chips back in if there's no match.  There are six cards and all are printed front and back for the choice of twelve cards (the game says the green side is less competitive and the red side is more competitive), and there are nine words on each card.

Being there are only 24 words, and in kindergarten (at least at my daughter's school) she is learning 50, so I wish there were more words to learn in the game (like the word ""she"" is played but not the word ""he"")  Also the word ""she"" is only on one out of the twelve cards; it seems that some words are focused on more than others.

The tiles and Zinger are made of sturdy plastic and should last well beyond when our infant is old enough to read. The player cards are similar in weight to the pages of a child's board book and have a shiny coating.  The length of the game is just long enough for a preschooler's attention span.

The playing cards have two sides.  The yellow side is for beginners and each word only has one letter missing.  Multiple letters will fit to make a word.  As we played, we spelled each word.  For example, one of the words was ___ AT.  Several consonants would fit into that blank to make a word.  This game opens up many opportunities to talk about site words, word families, rhyming words etc.  I know this will be a family favorite for many years to come.Both the cards and the tiles are heavy duty.

In the first Zingo, it's a bingo game with picture tiles that eject from a dispenser (controlling the dispenser is part of the appeal), then its Zingo with sight words (big incentive to learn to read them) — with cards cleverly designed with mnemonic devices to assist memory by association — then it's on to Zingo with numbers, and clock faces..... who knows what's next? It looks like the game we all grew up with, in the capable hands of Zingo's developers ThinkFun, can be used to learn to match, to read, to identify numbers, and to tell time!

When I heard of Zingo 1-2-3 and found it @ Amazon (at least [...] cheaper than the teacher catalogs that come to my school), I immediately jumped on it.  The game teaches number recognition, grouping, counting, and even operations. Zingo 1-2-3 is very age and developmentally appropriate and children are learning while playing - doing addition and not even realizing it!  I have parents who went out and purchased the game for home and came back talking of how the whole family played the game and had so much fun!!  Its a face paced, loud game as everyone is racing to be the quickest to fill their card and shout ZINGO!",Fun and Educational Toy,Style: Zingo 1-2-3 NumberVerified Purchase,62 people found this helpful

My children never want to stop playing it.  Zingo 1-2-3 introduces some basic math, which can get frustrating as an adult as your child counts the items on the card over and over again and you slide new numbers.  The younger the player, the harder it is for them to remember what number they need on the card.  I would not recommend it for children under 5 unless you are very patient.  I'm not sure if it really helps with the math, but it does help with counting and be ready count A LOT with a younger child.  I prefer the original zingo game probably because I am not patient.

I worked as a reading specialist this summer and my students begged to play it. The slider really makes the game exciting!  I saw improvements in how they read sight words in isolation in just two weeks. They started to pay more attention to the letters in the words.I used with struggling readers entering third grade who found it challenging because of they read below grade level. It would probably be best used with first and seconds graders or third graders with reading difficulties.I would just be careful about using it with younger children.  I have hesitated and not given it to my niece who is in kindergarten but I will this summer before she enters first grade, if and only if I feel she is ready.

A bit fast paced if you forget to slow down for the little ones (our mistake). My 4 year old cousin had a little trouble keeping up with the rules of the game, but she did enjoy this game. The tiles are big & easy to grip, but they are a bit strange to pop back into the little container during play. The tile holder has two very slim openings for you to pop them in & they tend to get stuck in the process. You quickly realize that maybe you've been trying to pop the tile back in the wrong way, but that isn't the case. Otherwise fun for the entire family, but don't forget to pretend that you can't count well either! ;]",V loved it!,Style: Zingo 1-2-3 NumberVerified Purchase,

We started playing this game as soon as my daughter started talking & it helped her learn some of her ‘first’ words. She is now almost 3 & we work on recognizing the beginning letter as we draw each tile. I have no doubt & high hopes that as the years go by she will begin to recognize the words as ‘sight words’!Another great plus to this game is that it can be played with just her & I or she can play with friends! Even her 10yr old brother enjoys playing this with her.The quality of this game is excellent as well! The boards are thick cardboard that hold up well to little fingers & the tile slider ‘thingy’ is nice & smooth & we never have any issues with it (unless it gets loaded improperly). Even the box is a nice thick cardboard for easy, long lasting  storage. I love that I didn’t have to buy a container for it, as organization & easy clean up are huge in our house! (Sometimes it’s the little things that make a product that much better!)Overall it is an excellent quality, fast paced, fun game that keeps their attention & teaches them new words, letter recognition & sight words that can be played for many years! We plan on buying the other Zingo games too!",Awesome game to play with kids as soon as they are able to start talking!,Style: ZingoVerified Purchase,

In order to be fair I've reviewed it with the actual price in mind. I depend heavily on reviews when I make purchases online and try to write useful reviews. If find this review helpful, I would appreciate you marking it helpful. Thanks!This is so fun! My kids are 2, 4, and 6, so there are not a ton of board games we can all play together. Zingo combines words and pictures on small plastic tiles. This allows both boys to participate--the pictures are very clear and are good representations of the objects. The words are common ones and easy to read.It is very well designed. The team has definitely thought of the important aspects of a game for ages 4+. The tiles are durable and the mechanism to choose tiles is simple. Less pieces to break! The game includes 78 tiles, which are stored in the dispenser plus 7 double sided cards. To make it more challenging as your kids grow and become quicker at reading and recognizing the words on the cards, you switch from the green side to the red side. The red cards share more words, so there is more competition for the tiles.I am delighted to find a game that is compact to store, durable, interesting for a variety of ages, adaptable, and not based on cartoon characters. I am so glad that I can enjoy playing it too. It isn't complicated but it still holds their attention.The mechanism to deliver the tiles is actually simple and slides smoothly enough that my 2 year old was able to use it. It kept her from stealing the tiles off the cards, too!It's a good value and the designers were thoughtful in their planning. We're going to try it out with the 9 and 13 year old cousins tomorrow and I'll update.",I depend heavily on reviews when I make purchases online and try to write useful reviews.

Zingo is a great game to start using those skills at an early age.  While this game is mostly touted for teaching pre-reading skills, I have found that it is a great game for learning to take turns.  Learning to lose graciously is so not easy so this game is a great starter to ease into that.  I've found that the sting of losing hurts a little less when you allow everyone to cover their board, but also state, ""this person actually won the game since they covered the board first, but everyone finished.""In Zingo there are yellow chips with various pictures, smile, shoe, cat, dog with the word written on the bottom.  There are 6 ""bingo"" cards with those various pictures on them as well.  One person slides the red chip holder forward and two chips slide out.  If you have one of those pictures on your board, shout out the word first and you get the chip to cover your board.  The first person to cover every picture wins the game.  The two sides are merely easy and more competitive.  You can choose to do regular bingo rules like four corners or X marks the spot.  Cleanup is easy because the chips all sit in the red holder.  Kids love the game because of the red slider and ability to use their outside voice inside, and adults love it because surprise!, you're learning!",Great Game for learning Pre-Game Skills,Style: Zingo,One person found this helpful

If you have played the regular version of Zingo!, you will have a good idea of how this game works. Zingo! Word-Builder is similar to the original in that the game consists of game boards, plastic tiles, and a ""Zing Zinger"" (tile machine).The game boards feature 3-letter words, with one or two of the letters missing. On their turn, players move the Zing Zinger to release two tiles and have to figure out if the letters can be used to create words on their game board. The person to complete their board first is the winner. There are two difficulty levels: one side of the board is missing only one letter (in either initial, medial, or final position), and the other side is missing 1-2 of the letters. One thing that is great about the game boards and plastic tiles is that all vowels are highlighted in red. This makes it very visual for beginning readers. Another positive aspect about this game is that the Zing Zinger now has slots on the top so that you can discard your tiles more easily (unlike my other/older version).I played this game with my Speech students (Kindergarten through 2nd grade) and we had a lot of fun! This activity was great for practicing basic decoding skills and trying to figure out whether the created word was a real word or a non-sense word (only real words are allowed). Here are some additional ways you could adapt this game for Speech or reading practice -- many of them targeting phonological awareness skills:*have players identify the beginning/middle/ending sounds*have players try to come up with rhyming words*prior to letting players move the Zing Zinger, ask them about the possible words they could make and which letters they would need*when players create a word, have them make a sentence using the word*after players make a word, ask them what other words they could have made if they had had the letter ___ instead*have players substitute sounds, e.g., ""You made the word 'bat'. What word do we get if we say /h/ instead of /b/?""All in all, this is a great game that builds early reading skills.

The double-sided card is yellow on one side for beginners and the other side is orange for advanced which was great because the younger kids used the yellow side while the older kids used orange and the adults used 2 cards to level the playing field. First you choose a dealer, the dealer slides the zinger forward and back revealing letter tiles players look at their card and try to be the first one to yell out a 3 letter word using either of the tiles whoever calls it out first takes the tile and places it on their card to form the word they called out.  The other tile can be claimed the same way any unclaimed tile goes back into the zinger. The first player to fill their card (or cards) and calls out Zingo! wins.

As a bonus, it requires NO batteries!Both the game boards and the game pieces have both pictures and words on them. Your child doesn't have to be able to read to play the game, but it does make the picture/word connection, to an extent. The game goes so fast that even I tend to mostly just look at the picture, and ignore the words. There is still a slight connection, though, and every little bit helps when a little one is learning words.The game comes with 7 game boards. These are double sided. The green side is for a less competitive game, and better for the littlest ones. There aren't that many shared pictures on this side, and the players aren't in so much of a rush to grab the tiles. The red side has a bit more competition, since there are more pictures in common. The players have to rush to grab a matching tile, before someone else grabs it.Each game goes really quick, so you're not spending a ton of time on each game. There are a few different options for playing the game. You can go the traditional ""Bingo"" route, or you can match designs, play multiple cards, or even fill up the whole card, which is what my oldest prefers. The traditional route is just way too quick for my children's tastes.Their favorite part of the game is the Zinger. It's super easy to load the tiles, and then slide them into view. They have to take turns sliding the tiles into view, because it's so much fun. The only negative we've seen is the fact that sometimes it seems the same tile is being played over and over(in a row). When you first open the box, you'll have to mix these tiles up, since they are placed together matched. If you don't mix them up, you WILL have the same tile continue to show up in a row. Even then, it sometimes happens that the same one will keep showing up. It is easy to dump them out, mix them up, and then reload them, though.This is a super simple game, but so much fun for little ones! I even enjoy playing it with them, which is pretty important.","Super simple, but fun!",Style: ZingoVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? ),9 people found this helpful

Many I have purchased, and some I have been blessed to get for the gratis so that I can share my ever so humble opinion.  This was one of them.  Gee, twist my arm!I was super dooper excited to hear that Zingo now has a Sight Word version.  I had been trying to figure out what other concepts we could finagle out of the Zingo world.  In our game arsenal we've got the traditional, the numbers (1, 2, 3) , and the travel versions of Zingo.  There are Spanish and Hebrew versions as well, but we haven't gone that route.  I bring them to and from school on a daily basis.When Sight Word Zingo came in the mail, Mudge was eager to get our first game going.  Though the boards themselves are a little visually busy, the concept is the same.  Match the word tiles to its board counterpart.  It still has the trademark Zinger, the Zingo slider with slots for the popping in unused tiles (great for fine motor development and wrist rotation).  The 72 tiles themselves are double-sided with 24 frequently used words from the Dolch list.As Mudge is only in preschool, he did not know the words but could match the tiles by the letters.  He loved trying to figure it out.  His persistence and memory began to pay off towards the end as he recognized the groups of letters like  and, we and me.  This has proven to be a great starter game to get new readers recognizing letter combinations as words.  It is also a great review game for up to first and second graders.  Many of the children I know have requested me to bring it in for bus arrival time or indoor recess.  For children with special needs, one of my teachers even thought of using it towards her Alternate Assessments, as many of them need to identify sight words.When our game was done, I asked Mudge his favorite part to which he answered, ""I like the matching Mommy.""  Was there anything you didn't like?  ""Well, Mommy, the red side was very difficult"".  Did you not like it?  ""Oh no.  I liked it, it was just difficult.""Finding the just right challenge can be difficult sometimes.  But Think Fun has found another winner again for the early learners.  Sight Words Zingo is another great addition to the home and school family.  For around $20, Zingo Sight Words will happily engage young readers while helping them learn.",Great for the early reader arsenal!,Style: Zingo Sight Words,

Essential to learning to read, sight words are the most frequently used words in the English language. Unlike other words, they often can't be sounded out phonetically and have to be learned through visual memory, which can be frustrating to kids.  Just bring out the captivating Zinger device that reveals two word tiles per turn as players race to cover their Bingo-like Zingo card first. Some of the word spaces on the cards have graphics corresponding to the word--an ""x"" marks the spot for ""here,"" a downward arrow points ""in,"" a speech bubble surrounds ""said,"" or a little figure waves for ""me."" Most of the squares have colorful patterns of stripes, checks and shapes to pair with the sight words, adding some pizazz to these critical words for reading. My little testers loved the game and wanted to play multiple rounds calling out words, ""I found a 'me',"" and even read the words as they reloaded the Zinger, ""Can I put 'said' in the bottom?"" Zingo! Sight Words engages Pre-K to 1st graders in such a fast paced game that they want to keep playing, becoming more proficient readers with each round.

From what I have read, tools like Zingo have been a great addition to a children's comprehension in reading and apprehension of sight words and Brooke seems to have such fun with the sliding doors.  Zingo is a classic Bingo-style game where kids have the chance to learn up to 75 sight words while playing a brilliant and fun card game to give their reading ability a positive boost.  While you can play with another child (or up to six) or an adult, Zingo is also a game you can play independently which I really love, too.  Sight words can be a source of frustration for new readers who are not able to sound out the words and the Zingo! Sight Words game does a great job in word recognition and making the process of learning sight words fun.  I can also see where reluctant readers have the option to practice and learn on their own and can move up to a group setting at a later time.  The Zingo! Sight Words game includes 72 Zingo! sight words tiles, six double-sided Zingo! cards, Zingo! Zinger card dispenser, instructions, and a learning guide.  One awesome thing about the Zingo! game is that it offers visual cues to help the player recognize words.  Visual memory is often the key to learning sight words for children which is usually where that source of frustration comes in among early readers.  Learning sight words is considered one of the keys of language fluency and I think the Zingo! word game does an excellent job of exposing and unlocking the secret of the English language to new and emergent readers.

This momma, loves fun learning games.  I am a firm believer that when we are having fun and enjoying whatever it may be, we are learning way more.The dreaded sight words or should I say ""Trick Words"" Sight words are words you cannot sound out usually, so after teaching your child to sound the word family words out and they get a good rhythm going on, now we have to throw a wrench in it with these crazy words...lol! Teaching sight words may try to trip you up, as a teacher, but don't let them keep you down.  Sight words, as you know are very important for children to learn, they make up over half of what we read, so you want your child to be strong and confident with these words, but it doesn't have to be boring and time consuming, make it fun with Zingo! Sight Words.I have one struggling reader and one fluent reader and they both enjoy this game.  My struggler, though I make sure to play this game mostly one on one to slow it down a bit, otherwise the fluent reader takes over and totally dominates the game, hence discouraging my struggler.  So beware, we want to make sure to give a little competiveness, but when it comes to learning make sure it is relaxed and fun.More about Zingo! Sight WordsTwo levels-One side of the game board is less competitive/Other Side more competitive.Developing Skills  Sight Word Recognition  Vocabulary  Matching  Observation and Perception  Concentration and Memory  Fine Motor Skills and Coordination  Following Instructions  Taking Turns  Winning and LosingThings we love about ZingoThis game is a spin off of the very popular bingo game and we love bingo!  I love the Zingo Zinger and it works great, the girls had no problem sliding it or putting the tiles back in the slots...even my 3 year old could do it:-)  Yes my 3 year old plays too, she gets some help from momma in her corner, but she is really good at matching, even though she can't read, that's why I love the pictures and patterns for extra help for the early learners and the struggling readers.Who Should Play Zingo?This game is meant for Pre-K-1st grade, but my 2nd grader and 3 year old preschooler love it too. You can vary the game to match the level anyway you want to.The Various Ways We PlayFor my 3 year old, she matches the words and the pictures, without knowing what they say.For my 1st and 2nd graders, I have them close their eyes after they say the word and have them spell it or use it in a sentence.I plan on in the future having them maybe write the spelling/sentence on paper to get extra handwriting practice in too...Not every time though I still want to keep it fun.What We would ChangeThere are actually only 24 words, the game description says 72 tiles so you would assume that there are 72 different words, not so...hmm.  I would definitely say please add more words:-)Homeschool mom of 3Seeking Kingdom First",Love to Learn,Style: Zingo Sight Words,33 people found this helpful

He loved the tactile feel of the yellow chips. Now at age 5 we can play the game as ""equals"" as he practices speed and fairness as well as the concept of addition.I love the clean up for this game. It contains many of the yellow chips but after use they skip right back into the main red game structure.  You slide them in a little slot and the structure somehow pulls them in once about half way in.  This ""pulling in"" is fun for the kids so mom doesn't get left to do it. It also helped my son with his fine motor skills,which were slightly behind and he preferred not to practice.

Those always made me mad but I have memorized them.  To my dismay, my kids have not.  I now know that they are called sight words.  Said is sed not sade.  Who is hoo and not wa hoe.  Now that I understand what sight words are, I feel good that I get to play Zingo! Sight Words with Number 2 Son who is learning how to read now and he's pretty good at it.  However, since sight words have little logic to them and this new Zingo game is good news indeed!  That is, because I can fairly say with confidence having studied more than three other languages, English is a really is a tough language to learn.  If kids or immigrants have a hard time learning to read English, it's not their fault.  Blame Brittania.We have owned and played   ThinkFun Zingo           and   ThinkFun Zingo 1-2-3           possibly hundreds of times (no kidding, Number 2 is crazy about Zingo) but for Zingo! Sight Words, I decided to consult an expert because I honestly don't know how kids are taught sight words. ""Oh, I love Zingo,"" said Alison Berkley, one of my favorite education experts who is a true toy lover.  She owns many bingo games and but to Alison, Zingo! Sight Words really stands out. ""It's a great game for kids because they like the tile things, [they] like clicking it back and forth!  It's really cool,"" she said.  ""They like shoving the tiles back and forth when they're done. The boards are really colorful and engaging.""Alison really likes that the boards have some sort of graphic to help kids distinguish between the words, especially when they look similar to each other.  (ie. there or three)  You might be wondering how they confused they could become but I've been watching my children closely and not only do they get confused but so do I!  Alison is right, the different images that ThinkFun creates for the words do help the children get used to the differences.  But then that worried me a little?  Is that a good thing? Shouldn't they be reading those words? Matching Words Requires Reading Words But Images Can HelpAlison said that we use images to teach vocabulary.  ""You hold up a cup and you say cup.  When you're teaching new words, that's always kind of what we do,"" Alison explained.  ""You're teaching them the meaning of that word and if it's concrete, like a number, you can show it.""Then Alison showed me what the clear difference was from Zingo! Sight Words and other Bingo Vocab games.  ""The other Bingos that I have have big pictures and tiny little letters on the tile boards as well as the tiles.  So there... they're just matching pictures,"" she said.  But for Zingo! Sight Words, it's different. ""You are asking them to read the word on the tile and then look at their board, so they are reading first and then matching second."" Finding New Ways to Learn?You are right Alison.  My kids ARE reading first and matching second, I LOVE THAT!!!!  Goodness, is there a Zingo! SAT Verbal Game?  I'm serious!  Wouldn't that be effective?  I am really trying to be more open-minded about learning reading and improving vocabulary.  I even found this book that used cartoons to help expand one's SAT Vocab list.  Wish I had this book back then!  ThinkFun, as usual, is doing something wildly creative with fun and learning and to kids,...well, I think all they see is the fun.  (which is why they learn it so fast!) Make it Work for Your FamilySpeaking of fun, this game is really a blast, especially for the little ones.  However, it can be more fun for the ones who might have a winner-loser anxiety IF you take turns and not let it be competitive.  (One person uses the Zinger at a time, if you have the word and matching tile, keep it, if not, give it out or push it back into the Zinger.)  Alternatively, you can be like Number 1 Son and make it much harder.  Just use more cards per game!  You can play against a little one if you use two cards and he uses just one. Use post it notes to cover up some words if you only want to use half a card.  There are lots of tiles in the Zinger so one adult and one kid can play this way without the adult falling asleep on the child because they purposely went slower to give the child a bit of a chance.Lastly, as those of us in New York and New Jersey and other affected areas deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, I think back to those first days where many of us suffered from what might be called Cabin Fever.  To be honest, I don't know if it was Cabin Fever that my family suffered.  Looking out of the window was frightening and we weren't exactly ""bored.""  Each time we turned on the T.V., (because we were lucky that we never lost power) the news grew worse and worse.  And I have to say that while this family had SO MANY GAMES here (can't hide this fact), the best games for us at the time had to be the ones that made you laugh.  We really needed to laugh.  This game helped us entertain each other.  Sure this is a tool to increase sight word recognition and it is really good at that but you can't underestimate the fun factor.  It's just as strong here and that is Zingo's gift.",Learning is Easy When It's Fun!,Style: Zingo Sight Words,3 people found this helpful

Unlike many of the games we play, our whole family actually enjoys playing it!  Our youngest player (2) is able to match the pictures to the card without difficulty, while our readers are able to also match the words.  For the older kids, we use the red side of the playing cards, which increases the challenge slightly since those items are less available.  This gives the younger kids a fair chance to win, even without the older players having to tip the game in their favor.The tile dispensing ""machine"" is a huge hit with all of our kids!  We play a fairly casual game with the machine rotating from player to player, so they can each experience the thrill on a regular basis. (ha ha)  This helps keep our younger players engaged more, since they know the machine will be coming around to them soon.  When a tile or tiles is/are left unused, there are slots that you can slip the tiles into at the top of the machine.  They kids love inserting the superfluous tiles almost as much as dispensing them!The one thing I wish there was a way to improve is the shape of the tiles and the corresponding openings in dispenser.  The tiles have a very subtle rounding at the top and are squared at the bottom, so that (theoretically) they always face the right way when dispensed.  This is excellent and important, BUT it is a bit of a nuisance at the end of game play to get all the tiles facing the right way (and mixed up) to re-insertion into the dispenser.  The top and bottom of the tiles are not distinct enough to simply have them fall into place, which would be nice.  I was trying to figure out what shape would actually work better for this and wondered if maybe something with more dramatic differences in the top and bottom would be good, so that they could just be lined up by touch, rather than having to do them one by one.  (Like more of a pointed top and wide rounded bottom?)  Still, the cleanup/reloading of dispenser part is just another way to keep the kids active and engaged and it works fine for us.Zingo is such an awesome game for the whole family and I love that it integrates learning into our game time...those are always my favorite games as it is so much fun to watch the kids having a blast and know that they are subconsciously picking up sight words, even at 2 yrs of age!",Clever & fun!

We love playing games together and never miss our weekly scheduled family game night. Board games always top our birthday and holiday lists and we are always on the hunt for a new game to play. Zingo! Word Builder was the perfect educational and fun game for my kindergartener.This fun, interactive game encouraged my son to review basic sight words as well as learn new words by building them himself. He loved sliding the Zinger and quickly grabbing the letter tiles before I could. He had a blast building three letter words and reading them aloud. As a former kindergarten teacher, I liked the game's goals of improving spelling, word recognition, letter sounds and consonants/vowels. With two levels of play, it’s a great game for both beginner and more advanced readers. This is definitely a game that will aid him in kindergarten and beyond. Zingo! Word Builder is a great game to pass on to his sister and for me to use in the classroom.  Perfect for the recommended ages 5-8.

My opinions are my own.  The following is an excerpt of my review of the game:Zingo! Sight Words takes the game premise of Bingo, replaces the numbers, and incorporates sight words which are words most frequently used in the English language. Mastering sight words creates fluent readers.Based on my own official game testers aka my children, Zingo! Sight Words offers up challenging yet accessible game play that encourages older kids to help their younger siblings learn to read. My 1st grader, to my surprise, often helped his kid sister navigate through each of her turns. Especially if he was given the responsibility of being the dealer. Dare I say that Zingo!

Zingo is still a little above his skill level, but he loved identifying the letters that came out of the Zinger and then working with me to help find words on the card to build with them. I love that it keeps his interest now, but has plenty of room for him to grow with his skill level (there are two different skill levels on the cards as well). I can tell that this one is going to get a lot of use!",Great game with room to grow!,Style: Zingo Word Builder,

You have bingo sheets and then use the red container to reveal the ""chips."" Tod o that you push down on the top and then players call out if they have a match. Most kids like bingo so essentially that's what makes this game a hit - kids can't wait to finish first with all the matches. What's a little tricky playing all together is the fact that you call out what you see and that can create some tensions. Also everyone (kids) usually want a turn pushing down the red thingy and that makes it hard to position it so everyone can see what chips come out. You could take turns and each game only 1 person does it, like a dealer. But if you have a bunch of kids that means you're playing the game for awhile - which may be fine or start to drag! I also thought it was an odd choice to make the chips not square shaped, so that it's a little wonky lining them up to fit properly in the red box. Seemed like it would have been a lot easier to make them all square so you don't have to take the time to line them up properly to fit smoothly. Overall it's fun and kids enjoyed it but isn't a top fav for our family.",This was pretty fun for my 7 year-old and almost 9 year-old,Style: ZingoVine Customer Review of Free Product( What's this? ),

It's very simple so children can easily understand the rules.Easy to operate the zinger machine - although my 3 year old kept trying to load the numbers in the wrong way round but they did still come out fine.Good quality and well made, it seems very durable.My 3 year old (nearly 4) loves maths and numbers so he was very excited with this game, and I like it as it will help him learn, and is also fun.It does not need any batteries, and has plenty of cards so up to 6 people can play at once. When you turn the card round there is another version on the other side, about addition, so if your child wants a bit more of a challenge they can play the addition version instead of the normal.Overall I found it really good - for both education and fun so we are very happy with it.I had not heard of 'thinkfun' before, but I will be having a look what else they have got. This game seems like good value.I would recommend it for children around 4 years old, as the box states, or 3.5 would probably be okay. We had to keep it out the way of our 2 year old as it is not really suitable for him and it does have small pieces (the number cards) which I wouldn't say are a real choking issue but he would probably throw them all round the house. However when he is a bit bigger it is something that children could play together by themselves as the zinger machine is very easy to use",Brilliant maths game,Style: Zingo 1-2-3 Number,2 people found this helpful

The Zingo Bingo cards have the number of objects shown and the number written in words, so it helps with counting and reading. The game is for children aged 4 and up, and for 2 to 6 players. Inside the box are six double-sided Zingo Cards, 72 Double-Sided Tiles, and the red Zingo! Zinger machine to issue the cards out one by one. The game has two levels of play (an easier side and a harder side if you turn the card over), plus there's 'easy cleanup' as the tiles just slot back into the Zingo machine after use.I got this game for my nephew (aged 5) and he enjoys playing it occasionally with me and his mum and dad. Sadly his other Brothers are aged 3 and 12, so they aren't that interested in the game being a bit too young and a bit too old - in fact the simpler picture version of Zingo Bingo (the   Zingo Bingo Game          ) is far better suited to younger kids, as you can just match the pictures, so check that game out as well. Still Zingo Number Bingo 1-2-3 is a well thought out educational game, and every preteen kid seems to love Bingo, so overall it's hit and we'll give it 5*.",This is the numbers counting version of Zingo - Good fun for Primary school kids,Style: Zingo 1-2-3 Number,One person found this helpful

These are double sided and each one has an easy level side and a more difficult level side. This is great as it means the game really can be played by kids of differing abilities simultaneously.The number 'machine' is nicely built but sadly not brilliantly designed. You load the tiles in the top (they must go in the right orientation, but the channels in which they sit are not snug fitting enough to prevent them being placed in the wrong way around. Fail.) and then slide the housing across the base and back again, and hey presto,  2 tiles are neatly deposited. The kids who shout out their values first get to place them on their cards a la regular bingo. The 'numbers' on the cards are more tricky - on the easy cards they are written in words, not number as well as represented pictorially. The harder side actually has no writing on at all and shows the number only as a sum that the kid must decipher. This is surprisingly tricky even for an adult when the pressure is on and the bingo red cloud has come down.Overall I really like this game - my kids love it too. I've only given it 4 stars as I don't think it's very well designed. The tile hopper lid  fits correctly only one way round, but can very easily be forced on the wrong way round which will ultimately cause it to break. This is poor for a kid's game. In addition, during game play, if a tile is taken by any player, then it is 'posted' back into the hopper through two small slits. This is very fiddly and interrupts game play. You can choose not to do this, but then you have tiles flapping around all over the place, which you have to load back into the hopper afterwards. The 'mechanics' of this game could be better.","learning can be fun... no, really!",Style: Zingo 1-2-3 Number,

This is a bingo game with 6 game boards. On one side you have pictures to count and the words to read, although obviously we weren't quite at the stage of reading them yet. The other side has addition sums in the form of two groups of pictures. The fun part that the kids really enjoyed was the Zingo tile holder. They slide the tower forwards and then back and two tiles are revealed. The child to work out if they need one of those numbers calls out the number and takes the tile. If one of the tiles isn't needed then the tile gets posted back into a slot at the top. The winner is the first to complete their board and shout Zingo.I really like that there are sums on one side so that you can extend your child's learning.The one 2 things that for me are slight downsides are that the pictures are quite small and sometimes the children struggled with the one to one correspondance of pointing to the pictures as they said the numbers but that was partly just the developmental stage they're at anyway and the tiles have to be put in a certain way. When the kids played on their own they put the tiles in so some went in backwards. They fit in but when they reach the bottom they don't come out when you slide.I would definately recommend this game if you are working on maths skills.",A resounding Success!,Style: Zingo 1-2-3 Number,

It is based on the good old game of Bingo.  The game contains 6 double sided cards, 72 double sided yellow plastic tiles which display numbers 0 - 12  and  a red plastic container which dispensers these tiles.  The tiles are easy to load and the dispenser is easy to use.  I would say however that the double sided cards are not very durable, hence my low mark, they can bend quite easily and would have been much better if they were a little thicker cardboard. The Green side of the card shows graphics and the corresponding written number - this is where I think the games falls down a little.  Maybe instead of displaying the 'written' number, the actual number should be shown then, this would help the younger children who couldn't yet read.  On the Red side easy sums are displayed by small graphics with a plus or minus sign.The game shows the age of 4 and my Grandson is not quite 3.1/2, and very smart, but isn't able to read yet; however we played the game together and I helped him with the counting and reading and he thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.

We both loved the tile dispenser, like magic how you slide it forward to reveal the numbers and then nice solid little posting slot to put them in again, very appealing. I was a little surprised that none of the cards have actual numbers on but an illustration of the number with the word written underneath. This initially meant my daughter found it very hard as she is new to reading and so was having to count everything. A few games down the line tho and she is getting much better at recognising the amounts and so I guess it is proving educationally beneficial from that point of view. She was very nearly put off completely though so maybe a starter set of cards with numbers on while they are getting the hang of it would be good.We don't play for long, 10/15 mins usually but she does ask for it 2/3 times a week and I don't mind playing as I know she won't want to play for hours. I think it's because she does have to work a bit that we don't play it longer but I think that's a positive really. As others have said its a shame the box couldn't be a bit smaller.

At the heart of the game is the ""Zinger"".  Load it up with number tiles and slide it back and forth to reveal the numbers.  Call out the numbers and the winner is the first person to fill their card.  Bingo!  The Zinger itself is robust and easy to fill - and it helps add a little bit of extra fun to what is otherwise a fairly traditional game.The number tiles are bright, clear platic pieces with the numbers clearly written on them in black.  For an extra twist, the Zingo cards have two sides, giving you two levels of play.  The green side has the numbers written in words, e.g., ""Nine"" and a supporting ilustration - in this example nine apples.  The red side is slightly harder and helps with adding on skills.  Rather than a number you simply get an illustrative sum, e.g., a picture of five cars followed by a plus sign and four more cars.We have lots of learning games, but this one has proven popular with the whole family.

So probably this game needs some adult help.

This is a very fun game and highly interactive! The numbers are always paired up with figures so the child can associate for example the number 4 to four butterflies which always come out together. Children get interested quickly and spend hours playing it. You could get them some prize like sweets or something to make it even more fun!,Perfect for little learners!,Style: Zingo 1-2-3 Number,
