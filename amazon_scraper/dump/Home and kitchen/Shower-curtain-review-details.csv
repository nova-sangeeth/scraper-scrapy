One edge of the hem seemed to collect a tiny bit of water and mildewed. I put a drop of chlorine bleach down the hem and it vanished.

Liner is advertised to never mildew which is a HUGE plus for a lazy person like me. Liner does have magnets at the bottom but they're not very strong. The place I rent has an old school iron tub and the magnets barely want to stick to it. The plastic is a little heavier so you don't get those gentle hugs while you're taking a long shower. If you're curious, the brand carries a 1 year warranty on the liners too so if anything goes wrong there's coverage. So far in the last few months of using it I haven't seen any mildew and has held up. I'm happy with the purchase so far as by now I would have to be buying new liners with my old brand.

The edge nearest the faucet has formed a complete cylindrical roll, so the liner doesn't adhere to the shower wall at all. There is about a 6 inch gap where water can get through. I try to warm the liner with very hot water at the edge to uncurl it, so it will close the gap, but even that doesn't help.I had a more flexible liner with multiple weights at the bottom seam, and that worked great for years. It started to tear after years of use, so I bought this one. This one started to curl after less than a month of usage. Waste of money. I am going back to a curtain with weights, and one that is made of a more flexible material that won't roll itself up at the edges. It'll probably cost more, but will be well worth it.

Good idea to spray it off at the end of every shower or take a couple cups of water and pour onto any shampoo/soap suds/etc if you don’t have a detachable sprayer. Also do not leave the curtain open as mildew will form in the folds because they cannot dry when the curtain is open - this is true for any brand of liner. This also greatly extends the amount of time before it will need actual cleaning. I just throw mine in the washing machine with hot water, a little detergent and some vinegar.

It’s February 2020 and still in great condition. Really worth the price. I have back problems so it was hard to clean other shower liners I’ve had in the past. This liner hardly gets dirty and is really easy to clean when it does. The suction power is still very good too. I normally don’t write reviews but this is the best liner I’ve ever used. Hope this review helps,Very good quality,"Size: 72"" W x 72"" HColor: ClearVerified Purchase",One person found this helpful,1,1,62593673,Public

It does the trick keeping water inside the shower. You don't have to worry about water spraying all over your bathroom floor any more. I really like a nice clean shower curtain liner like this one for my bathroom on a regular basis. The LiBa Mildew Resistant Anti-Bacterial PEVA shower curtain is a great choice!",Great shower curtain liner,"Size: 72"" W x 72"" HColor: ClearVerified Purchase",,7267,1233,2641,Public

I wanted to get something that was a good deal but also good quality and this product has been just that! We haven't had any issues with it. It is thicker than most shower liners that I've had before. It sticks to the sides of the tub! It is a little longer than our linen curtain that we have outside of the tub, which bothered me at first because I thought that it wouldn't work out but it's honestly been a great thing because it keeps the water from getting outside of the tub! We also haven't had any issues with mildew or anything of that sort. Definitely recommend this shower curtain!",Recommend!,"Size: 72"" W x 72"" HColor: ClearVerified Purchase",,,,20596372,
