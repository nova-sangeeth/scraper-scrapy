I'm not going to lie- I was skeptical when I saw the price when I ordered them,  but my great dane managed to tear one of my other sets, and well, desperate times call for desperate measures. I found myself on Amazon- just like you are now,  reading reviews, trying to save a few bucks, but not ending up with the crappiest sheets ever made- the Internet can be terrifying like that (I've been scorned,  can you tell? ).Then I stumbled across these... the Mellanni Bed Sheet Set, and I was SURE I had read the price wrong or that there was some 'catch'. Less than $20 for an ENTIRE sheet SET for my Queen size bed... with mostly positive reviews?? I've paid more than that for 2 pillow cases! There were a large selection of colors to choose from  (I went with the dark brown to go with the hand made quilt on my bed).... still less than $20 for the sheet set- no catch yet. Checked out, paid for,  now we wait...2 days later my precious cargo arrived.  After I ripped that package open like a kid on Christmas, I looked and inspected my new sheets for something,  ANYTHING, to be wrong with them. I got nothing! Now,  you should know,  these ARE a thin sheet- you can practically see through them if you hold them up to the light- but don't let that discourage you.The 'sleep test': I put these suckers on my bed for the TRUE test of any sheet, and oh my... they are fantastic! They are soft. It's like coming home after a long, yucky day at work,  and all you want is to crawl your sorry self into bed for the night,  and your sheets GIVE YOU A HUG all through the night.  But they are breathable,  so you aren't sweating like crazy. Ah-May-Zing!They also wash nicely, they come out soft- but not 'flannel soft', and they fold up neatly  (except for the fitted sheet- only because I don't know how to do that- seriously,  WHO EVEN KNOWS HOW TO FOLD A FITTED SHEET?!??)Would I buy these again? If you even have to guess, then I need to work my my writing skills, because it's absolutely a 'YES' from me! These sheets are honestly one of the best bargains I've ever found online.

I'm not going to lie- I was skeptical when I saw the price when I ordered them,  but my great dane managed to tear one of my other sets, and well, desperate times call for desperate measures. I found myself on Amazon- just like you are now,  reading reviews, trying to save a few bucks, but not ending up with the crappiest sheets ever made- the Internet can be terrifying like that (I've been scorned,  can you tell? ).Then I stumbled across these... the Mellanni Bed Sheet Set, and I was SURE I had read the price wrong or that there was some 'catch'. Less than $20 for an ENTIRE sheet SET for my Queen size bed... with mostly positive reviews?? I've paid more than that for 2 pillow cases! There were a large selection of colors to choose from  (I went with the dark brown to go with the hand made quilt on my bed).... still less than $20 for the sheet set- no catch yet.

After I ripped that package open like a kid on Christmas, I looked and inspected my new sheets for something,  ANYTHING, to be wrong with them. I got nothing! Now,  you should know,  these ARE a thin sheet- you can practically see through them if you hold them up to the light- but don't let that discourage you.The 'sleep test': I put these suckers on my bed for the TRUE test of any sheet, and oh my... they are fantastic! They are soft. It's like coming home after a long, yucky day at work,  and all you want is to crawl your sorry self into bed for the night,  and your sheets GIVE YOU A HUG all through the night.  But they are breathable,  so you aren't sweating like crazy.

If you even have to guess, then I need to work my my writing skills, because it's absolutely a 'YES' from me! These sheets are honestly one of the best bargains I've ever found online.

For those of you who would like to know about the corner pockets, they were deep and fit the corners of the mattress perfectly. The elastic although present is nonexistent. A good fitting sheet should hug the mattress totally. If having a bottom sheet that does not fit snugly is not one of your concerns, then this brand of sheets would be fine for you.

I have also slept on them in the chocolate brown color at my mom's.The reason I think there is some difference in opinion about how soft these sheets are may come down to a couple of reasons...1. It seems that the white sheets are softer than the colored sheets (as I said earlier I have three sets in the white, and one in beige and I have slept on the darker brown sheets in my mom's guest room.) The white sheets are so soft it makes laying on my bed feel like I'm on a silky smooth but cozy pillow. The beige and brown sheets just seem *slightly* scratchier... not quite as soft. Don't get me wrong, they are still softer than most sheets at this price point and still worth using on a guest bed or another bed that's going to get a lot of use, but my husband and I can definitely tell a difference between the white sheets and the other colors.and2. I think what you wash them with and the temperature you use matters. I always use vinegar and wash my sheets with environmentally-friendly laundry detergent (like Charlie's). Depending on the types of stains on the sheets (blood, chocolate), I will usually wash them in cold water because cold water lifts those types of stains. Hot water will set them. If I've spot cleaned them first, then I will wash them on warm warm or warm cold. Washing them in hot water seems to effect how soft they are. And I never line dry because I don't have the space for that. So in the dryer they go.They are thin and don't breathe super great, BUT they are very soft to sleep on. And seriously for the price, I don't even hesitate buying white sheets anymore. I actually just replaced the twin set in my guest room because they *mysteriously* got chocolate milk all over them.

They offered to send a replacement ASAP.  She was professional, courteous and prompt in responses.  It arrived within 4 days and was in perfect condition.  I still have concerns about the thinness of the fabric but it appears per my reading about ""microfiber"" that this is a pretty normal quality of microfiber.  It is supposed to be a durable product in spite of if it being thin.  Time will tell.  I encourage all buyers to read more about ""microfiber sheets"" online prior to purchasing just so you can see the pros and cons and how to care for them to ensure their longevity.  It's nice to see that this company backs their product, cares that the customer is pleased with it and doesn't disappear after the initial sale is complete.INITIAL REVIEW:I sniffed around for the best reviewed DARK GRAY (i.e. charcoal) microfiber bed sheets and although it wasn't clear cut, I ended up purchasing these.  Only time will tell if I made the right choice overall.Upon receipt, I did a brief visual inspection to look for stains.  It was one of the complaints from some reviewers so I thought I should take a cursory look.  I only noticed one or two modest stains (oily by appearance) which left me confused.  Was someone in their manufacturing plant eating an oily Italian cold cuts sandie while producing or inspecting these sheets?  How in the __ do brand new sheets end up with oily or greasy looking stains?  Way to go inspector #147 who apparently decided NOT to take a lunch in the break room.Regardless, I'm not packing these up and dealing with the hassle if I can try and get them out myself.  Needless to say, that likely wasn't the right call since after washing (exactly in the manner they instructed) I now realize there were about 4 oily looking stains which are still visible after drying them on LOW (per their instructions).  I am a visual flaw-oriented person so this does bother me since I bought a NEW product, not a used one.  Hopefully when the wife gets back in town, she won't notice or care and I can learn to live with this since it's rarely going to be seen by human eyes.Another con is the material DURABILITY which I can see why other reviewers have stated that these sheets ripped within 2 years.  This material is very SOFT and FANTASTIC to sleep on.  Unfortunately, this material is also very THIN and I would strongly recommend using ""kid gloves"" when placing these on your mattress.  If you yank it hard onto a corner, I could easily see you increasing the likelihood of a rip or tear.Another con is the FIT.  The corners are loose and baggy compared with the pretty good quality 100% cotton sheets we were using prior to these.  Our cotton sheets fit nice and taut on the corners hugging them well whereas these appear baggy and loose and not form-fitting.  Our old sheets were KING (not CalKing) and these are KING, so I'm not sure if it is a size difference or material issue.The color is a true DARK GRAY and very pure gray.  There isn't any blue or silver hue to it at all.  The stitching is good, not great.  I saw some loose thread inside but I believe it was extra thread and not pertinent stitching to the integrity of the sheets.These are definitely warmer than our old cotton sheets which is nice since we have a condo with very high ceilings and it gets cold in the winter.  In Southern California, builders barely use insulation so oddly enough sound and cold penetrate more than you would think.  Additionally, you won't confuse these with flannel sheets for warmth and I feel that they'll still work during our summers since we're fairly close to the ocean.The two best things about these sheets are the REASONABLE PRICE and the SOFTNESS.  The worst things are the questionable durability, the fit and the manufacturing quality control (i.e. oily potato chips or deli meat stains).","""The Big Unknown""...",Size: KingColor: GrayVerified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

We bought the king set in tan and the length of the flat sheet is great on our 16"" mattress.  The sides come down to the top of the bed's side rails and the bottom allows us to tuck under the mattress and put hospital corners on it with no problem leaving about 6 inches fro, the top of the mattress.  The flat sheet isn't so long that you can fold the top back onto itself.  Maybe if you have a thinner mattress, but tucking it at the bottom on a 16"" mattress down't leave enough of the sheet to fold back at the top of the mattress. So if that's the look you want and have thick pillow-top mattresses, this will disappoint you.  These are rather light weight (good for hot climates) and super soft(soft is somewhat relative- but soft too me). I agree with the other reviews that they may stain easier than other sheets so oils and lotions maybe a problem.  The other odd point to note, the top of the sheet does not have a nice piping to denote the top that mimics the piping on the pillow cases (as seen in the picture).  The king pillows easily fit our king pillows.  The fitted sheet appears to have elastic all the way around, not just the top and bottom where the corners are so if that bothers you, then these aren't for you.Overall, for the money (we sent $42) these are great sheets.  I thought to give it four stars since it lacks the detail on the flat sheet (ie the piping at the top of the sheet that is found on almost all flat sheets).  but that would be unfair since you can't see it and it doesn't detract from the feel or how it functions.",I love this sheet set,Size: KingColor: TanVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful

My wife likes to crank up our bedroom air to the temperature of a meat locker and cover herself in half a dozen blankets. But even she agreed with me. But I somehow got used to them quickly. I want to wait until summer to really be certain these deserve 5 stars. It is quite cold in Denver right now, but I may just up my rating at that time. I think the problem is that these just don't breathe like a fine cotton, but they still have a unique and wonderful feel to them. I got adventurous and ordered the coral. I really love the color. I will almost certainly be buying some other colors soon.10/29/19-I just upped my review from 4 stars to 5. i now have 3 sets of Mellanni sheets.

Putting the sheets in the washer made my hands black from the dye. Even after washed, the dye from the sheets were on my toddlers feet and legs from jumping around on the bed. Luckily it didn’t stain our mattress but it stained pretty much everything else the top of the sheets touched. Not one review mentions dye staining so maybe I just got a bad batch of sheets?

Put them on low for 30 mins in the dryer because i knew there was no way they needed more time than that since they were so thin. 30 minutes passes and I take them out, and to my surprise, the main sheet had these random stains all over it, yet the other did not.

The mattress sheet seemed to have just disentigrated in the wash or dryer, because there were small holes in certain sections of the sheet that were not there before i washed them.

They're incredibly soft and comfortable, they wash well, and don't wrinkle easily. What more can you really ask for? Heads up, they fit a little loosely on the majority of my mattresses. However, that is fine by me. It makes making the bed snappy and keeps me from having to hurt myself while wrestling with a fitted sheet to get it on. Added bonus, the customer service is fantastic. I had an issue with one set not fitting my queen mattress (which now I believe was just a full-sized sheet mismarked as a queen), and they were so very kind and fair and rectified the situation promptly. These are sellers that stand behind their product and value their customers, and they go the mile to prove it. Needless to say, from my experience, I believe that this seller and their sheets have indeed earned their 51,000+ reviews and nearly 5-star rating.

The WORST Sheets I’ve ever seen. I was so excited about getting an 1800 thread count sheet set. I just recently redid my master bedroom including new paint, duvet etc. and I ordered these Violet Queen size sheets from Mellanni. I had never heard of this brand before but the description says 1800 thread count, stain resistant, wrinkle resistant… How could you go wrong?? Well, evidently, many ways. I use several pillows so I ordered the queen size sheet set and additionally a set of king size pillowcases as I usually layer large pillows on the bottom and then the queen then I decorative pillow on top. I always wash my sheets/clothes before I use/wear them. They were shipped separately, why I don’t know, but I got the sheets first and just waited until the pillowcases came. I was in a hurry and didn’t check everything out closely like I usually do. I opened both packages and threw them in the washing machine “by themselves” with a tide pod. Threw them in the dryer with a bounce sheet.  I remove them at the end of the cycle while it was still tumbling it was in cool down At end of dryer cycle, which also is supposed to help on the wrinkling of items. As soon as I pulled one item out I was just shocked!! I have never had any material that wrinkled so badly. I took them to the bed and laid them out and I see the stains all over several areas of the sheets and pillowcases. It almost looked like grease stains, for lack of a better example, much darker then the sheets. Again, they were in alone with nothing but a tide pod and in the dryer with just a bounce dryer sheet. All pieces were extremely wrinkled and to add one more problem, they were two different colors. When I went to look at the packaging they were both the same name brand they were both supposed to be Violet. And then I look at the packaging for the sheets and they had sent me a king size instead of a queen. This has nothing to do with “them getting confused because I ordered king size pillowcases” because, as I said, they were shipped separately. Thank God this was ordered through Amazon because they took them back immediately and credited my card. See pictures for proof of all that I have posted. Remember these did not sit in the dryer it was still tumbling when removed. When I first called customer service they kept trying to talk me into trying another set. I did what I should’ve done in the beginning and started looking at the reviews starting with the one star and found that all of these things have been a problem for other customers. I don’t know how people could have sheet sets that reviewed out at five?? Maybe when made in China or wherever outside of the US, was it different material? different dye jobs? I have no idea.

The elastic does NOT fit anywhere near 16"".  12-14"" maybe, but it stretches the sheet so tight I was worried I'd never get it off again.These are not a natural fiber, and, therefore, are HOT, I mean HOT.  I am always, always cold, so I figured even a little warmth would be ok.  No, these sheets do not breathe, they just trap whatever heat your body gives off and keeps you in that heat.  So, you wake up sweaty and wishing you could have your real sheets back.A $40 price tag for a set of Queen sheets sounds great until you realize they aren't any good.  Do yourself a favor, find ACTUAL Egyptian Cotton sheets from a real linen store and enjoy an actual good nights sleep on sheets that breathe, and wash up like a dream every time.

Generally in the summer, I only sleep under the comforter anyway, regardless of the sheet, so that's usually not an issue. When it cools off I'll have to give them a spin for the 'real' heat test.Regarding the quality, they are extremely lightweight, EXTREMELY over-sized which makes putting on the elastic sheet/top sheet a breeze (my old sheets would only last about a week before I was fiddling to wrap them around the mattress again) and do seem to 'stain' fairly easy. While stains wash out fine, I noticed they really soak up sweat/spills. I don't think these will be sheets you can sleep in every day for years, but with the cost being a 1/3 of most high quality sheets, I'll probably end up with a couple sets anyway for 'accidents' or otherwise.Overall I think I'm a convert over Egyptian Cotton, primarily in that the quality seems to be ALL over the place with cotton regardless of the tc. While I can already tell these aren't the 'lightest' sheets around, unless you're a heavy night sweater I'd imagine you'd be fine; and this is coming from a big guy who runs like a furnace.",Bedding 'snob' that's a microfiber convert!,Size: KingColor: GrayVerified Purchase,

By far the best sheets I have ever purchased yet. The cons, I have cats, one of my cats uses her claws to jump on my bed as my bed is higher and she is rather old. You can see all the claw marks by the thread fray she’s caused. However, this happens with my pants and shirts also should my cats knead while laying on me. It’s hard to find material that’s “cat claw proof.” Remember when I said they keep me warm, that’s going to be awesome during the winter, but in the summer heat at night, it was a little bothersome. Haven’t had them long enough to experience winter with them, but I am excited for the warmth to come! I know they’ll do a great job. They wash well, not much shrinking and they slightly wrinkle. I don’t care much for the flap on the pillow cases. Not sure what their function is as of yet and it makes the pillows look a little odd if that flap isn’t pressed after watching them.

I will be purchasing these sheets from now on.  They are absolutely worth the money.  Of note, I almost did not buy because I read a review about them being poor quality, stained, and really thin.  I don't know what the issue was with that individuals purchase; however I can say it could not be farther from the truth.

We have tried several of the similar brushed microfiber sets from other brands with competitive prices. So far, Mellanni is a cut above the rest! In fact we purchased 2 different sets for the same price during the Black Friday sales week. One Mellanni set, and one Utopia Bedding set. Normally the Mellanni is just a few $ more than the Utopia, and in all honesty Its worth paying that extra couple $. The Utopia isnt bad, but the Mellanni just feels like it's significantly superior in quality. Its thicker than the Utopia. By comparison it feels like a more expensive sheet with higher thread count. The Utopia is soft, but the Mellanni is even softer! It feels like other sheets that we've paid 2-3x the price for in department stores! Soft is really important for me.

Sleeping on rough fabrics can cause parts of my body to feel like they have really bad sunburn or road rash. Its awful! These sheets have been wonderful! They're so silky soft to the touch, but not slippery like silk or satin sheets.For the price, you really can't go wrong!  My wife and I have bought similarly priced sheet sets in Walmart that were nowhere near this soft, comfortable or durable for that matter! They dont offer nearly as many color options either. Our original Mellanni set from several years ago is still like new. No color-fading, loose threads, rips or tears. Bought a set for my Grandmother too and she absolutely loves em.

They are soft, comfortable, wrinkle-resistant, and colorfast. I purchased the burgundy color sheets to match a quilt that I recently purchased. Right out of the package, the color was gorgeous. I washed the new sheets on the bedding setting (warm water, cold water rinse, low spin). I put a Color Catcher in the washer, to check to see how badly the burgundy color ran (as reds can do). What went in as a beautiful burgundy, came out as a muted rust color. In the dryer, I put in dryer balls, as I usually do, to help the sheets dry faster, without static. When the dryer stopped, the white dryer balls were red. I am worried about putting these sheets on my bed, as the color will  probably rub off on everything it touches. I will rewash the sheets before putting them on my bed. If the color is still bleeding, it will not be used.This review is about the burgundy colored sheets only.

The pillow cases have a nice decorative detail one one edge but the flat sheet doesn’t have that detail on the top edge. It’s a very plain edge that makes the sheet look very cheap and it appears as though the sheet is not from the same set as the pillow cases.2. The flap that was designed to keep the pillow case on the pillow just flaps open. It doesn’t really hold the pillow.3. Pilling: both pillow cases have pilled a lot. The fitted sheet has pilled a little.4. These sheets really build up static electricity. Every time I dress or undress the bed I get shocked multiple times.5.

I really like the smooth cotton like texture so I am very happy with that.What I am disappointed in is that the fitted sheet is not deep enough for my 17"" mattress. There is not enough material to be able to tuck in the sides which results in the sheets lifting up enough to form a bit of a puddle on the top of the bed after sleeping on them each night. They don't pop off, but without being able to tuck the fitted sheet in they don't stay crisp and neat and require adjusting each day.

I think they look Sage-y in the picture, but they do have a mintier tint in person. They're light, though, and I would still consider them a neutral. It's a prettier color than in the picture, but I couldn't capture well in the lighting I've got in a picture. They're really nice soft sheets and seems like they'll hold up well. Personally, I prefer a stiffer, less soft sheet, but my husband loves these and doesn't like my 'scratchy' cotton ones. I do find that these sleep warmer, and that they're a bit harder to move on, than cotton sheet, mainly because they're more 'grabby' on the surface. I also personally think they get clingier and static-y-er than cotton sheets, but that's up for debate. They've got a really smooth and soft feeling, but they do go on more like cotton sheets in that they don't stretch. Example: jersey sheets are soft, but they're stretchy soft material. These are a non-elastic-y material that just have a soft finish, which makes them stay better than, say, jersey sheets. The actual packaging the sheets are in looks a bit dated, but the sheets have a really classic style with the lines on the top hem. I don't generally fold back my sheet to show it, but these look nice enough I could.",Super soft sheets,Size: KingColor: Spa MintVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful

The pillow cases do have the inside pocket to fold the entire pillow inside the case. You can buy extra pillow cases in varying sizes and colors and although not the same low price as the sheet set they are not unfair.

The only negative points I could say is that it definitely isn’t ‘wrinkle resistant.’ I have tried every means of making this possible, but it is still MUCH less wrinkle prone than my other quality sheets, and the wrinkles so far don’t seem to stay too long once bed is made. I personally don’t rate sheets based on wrinkle-proneness, but since it was advertised and part of the rating, I thought I’d mention. The only negative thing to me personally is that they are somewhat thin. So, you can see patterns and writing through the sheets a bit, which also makes me think they may not be the best mattress/pillow protector if the fabric is so thin.But, these are seriously some of the softest sheets I’ve ever slept in. SO soft and  comfortable. The luxury feel of these sheets makes up for any of the tiny flaws. PLUS, they are super affordable, there is no denying its worth.

Just not the same as 1500 thread count cotton. These sheets are are so stretchy too. So if you're rolling about in the sheets, then you can easily get wrinkles under yourself. I think this is where they differ from regular high thread count sheets.  I was hoping that the ""elastic that goes all the way around"" would keep them super tight on the mattress, but with the stretchy-Ness of the sheet, its irrelevent.

He ended up learning to fly and flew into the bedroom several times prior to being released and pooped on the nice new sheets several times . Horrible purple poo due to eating blackberries and blueberries and I was so worried about my new sheets being stained.

This is my first order and certainly won’t be my last. Even my roommate was surprised at the quality and texture. They are on the “thinner” side and more of use for summer sleeping. I prefer thinner sheets as I would rather be cooler when I sleep and it makes for an easier wash. If you’re looking for thicker sheets, and if you reside in a cooler climate, then I wouldn’t recommend these sheets for that purpose solely.The comments on these sheets are comprised of mostly positive, excellent remarks. For those who claim they are not soft I would recommend to return them and try again. There is bound to be a lemon, or in this case, a different manufacturer, that possibly made those sorts of sheets. At least give them a try again after one return. I really think they’re amazing and worth it. Let’s be honest, for 30$ can you really go wrong...?",Comfortable and cool - perfect bedsheets are here!,Size: KingColor: CoralVerified Purchase,

And not everyone has the same tastes, requirements, criteria, and/or expectations of any given product purchase.That being said, my wife and I absolutely LOVE these sheets. They fit perfectly with nice deep pockets and are very soft and comfortable; surprisingly soft and comfortable for the price. My wife didn't know I ordered these sheets (after one of the sets of sheets we were using ripped). When I surprised her with this set, she was immediately impressed with the brand name and assumed I had spent too much money to replace an old worn out set of sheets. When I asked her what she thought I paid for these, she said ""Probably about $90 or more."" When I told her they cost $29.70 she looked at me like I was lying. Then she realized I was telling the truth and now she thinks I'm a genius. (I am a genius, but not just because I bought these sheets...)I (we) highly recommend the Mellanni Brushed Microfiber sheets.

I would recommend these as a good set of ""back-up"" sheets or for a room rarely used. I prefer a little bit higher quality sheet for my regular, daily used bed.",Decent sheets,Verified Purchase,

These sheets were packaged very nicely.  I ordered the light gray which is a very pretty color. I just switched from a queen bed to a king, which means that I have a lot of replacing to do. I bought a high quality set of cotton sheets but needed an additional set and I wanted color to contrast with my duvet.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give these sheets a try and  I REALLY like them.  They are soft and comfortable and went through the laundry beautifully.  They have very deep pockets so fit well over my thick mattress. It will take a few washes to determine if they stay as nice as they are now.

They came out even softer and they did not bleed color in the washer.  I put them on my queen size pillow top mattress and they fit perfectly.  The corners stay in place when I toss and turn throughout the night.

Unfortunately those sheets have stayed in storage while we purchase more microfiber sheets. Plus our bedroom tens to get extremely hotter than other rooms in the house.
