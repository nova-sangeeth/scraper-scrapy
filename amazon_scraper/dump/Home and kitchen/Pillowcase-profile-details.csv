I find the difference in my hair between sleeping on a regular cotton pillow case and a satin is night and day.

I wash my pillow cases quite often and found that the zipper style would eventually break even though I always use a lingerie bag to wash these satin pillow cases in.

I am a college student on a budget so in my search for a silk case, I wanted to order the cheaper alternative option (satin) to compare it to the silk and see if they really were worth that much more money.For my trial I had these satin ones (about $5 each), a 19 momme silk that was about $20, a 21 momme silk that was about $25, and a 25 momme silk that was about $40. Comparing them all side by side, the silk cases were definitely worth the extra money in my opinion. They were much softer and more cooling and comfortable. The satin cases just felt slightly stiff and were extremely staticky. Everything clung to them (cat hair, my hair, air fuzzies, everything).Being only $5, I was really hoping I would be okay with the satin ones but I was so uncomfortable, I switched back to my old bamboo pillowcase in the middle of the night.I can‚Äôt say whether these have the same hair and skin benefits as the silk ones since I didn‚Äôt sleep on it over many nights but I can say that this pillowcase is not comfortable or cooling so if you are considering this as a cheaper alternative to silk, my recommendation (after trying them all) is to spend the twenty extra bucks on a 21 momme case which in my opinion, is still is a pretty good deal and definitely worth the $20 in quality and comfort.Also I wanted to mention that I bought navy and the color of these looked more purple in person. I ordered navy in the 100% silk ones as well and the color was much more true to navy than these were.",I tried satin and 3 different silk momme cases - cheap option but not even comfort to be worth it,Verified Purchase,43 people found this helpful

I am so surprised by how comfortable these pillow cases are- not just for ""satin"" but for all else I have every used. I use two king sized pillows. The bottom pillow is has a pillow protector and a regular pillow case, then the pillow I put my head on is a king sized pillow with a pillow protector on it, and I think I kept a regular pillow case on it. Then this ""satin"" one is slid on top. The material is sleek, yet I don't feel like I am sliding around on it at all. Smooth but I stay in place. It feels cool or neutral- never too warm.  I really don't know if it is overall helping my hair or face, but at least I am hoping. I dont know why, but the feel of this pillow case is unexpectedly comforting. Why is that? Too feel that sensation is something worth giving 5 stars to.Edit: I continue to use these, and the pillow cases are still in great condition.

Interesting packaged always gives me a good first impression.

Google indicates it may be envelope closure?) the holds everything securely in place. Satin pillowcases, in my experience, are slippery and tend to slide off the pillow every now and then so this design eliminates that problem, woohoo!Like most satin, I don't doubt this will pull if you wear jewelry to bed.

I figure since they're polyester, not silk, that maybe cheapness did not necessarily indicate extremely low quality. Polyester is, after all, inexpensive to produce.I have several polyester satin scarves that are absolutely delightful to the touch, with an almost liquid slip. That is what I was expecting.Unfortunately, these feel more like the cheap lining satin that you find on the inside of pants and handbags. While a decent thickness, the material of these pillowcases is rather crisp and stiff, and your fingers can clearly feel the weave of the fabric. I was willing to trade off the breathability of natural fiber for the smoothness of polyester satin, but in this pillowcase I would get neither. Sadly, these are getting sent back unused. They're pretty, but that's about it.Edit: oh yeah, I just wanted to say that the packaging is great, super cute and easy to open.

I checked and it costs $24.99 for 1 piece. When I saw this satin pillowcase under similar products and saw how much cheaper it was ($10 for 2 pieces), I purchased both the satin pillowcase and the Mulberry silk in Ivory to compare. The Mulberry silk was super soft. Then I felt the satin one after. To my surprise, they felt super similar. Even my boyfriend could barely tell much difference.Similarities: They both feel soft, smooth, and cool on my hair and skin. It'd be hard to go back to other types of pillowcases. I wouldn't know the long-term result on my hair/skin or the longevity of the two products but I love them for now (will be keeping both brands since I have many pillows).Differences:1. I purchased both in queen size and this was a HUGE DIFFERENCE considering all my pillows were standard size. The Mulberry silk queen size was too big for my standard pillow (I have to exchange the size) the Bedsure satin queen size was perfect. If I would've gotten the Bedure satin in standard it might be too small. So get the queen size if you have standard pillows.2. Bedsure Satin is shinier than Mulberry silk in terms of color. This doesn't bother me much but if I have to choose which color I prefer, I probably like the Mulberry since the color is softer and less shiny (I think about it as ""matte shiny"" if it makes sense).3. Mulberry silk is slightly softer & thinner than Bedsure Satin (again Bedsure satin is still a good cheaper alternative if you are on a budget).4. Mulberry silk has a zipper, Bedsure satin doesn't. This isn't a big deal considering the price difference but since they are a bit more slippery than a cotton pillowcase, it'd be good to have a zipper so my pillow stays inside. I'm surprised my pillow hasn't slipped out much from the satin pillowcase so far so it's good.Bottom line: If you are considering a cheaper alternative to Mulberry silk, the Bedsure Satin pillowcase was decent.

I've recently fallen in love with silk/satin pillowcases as my scalp runs greasy so combine that with being a hot sleeper I found myself having to either wash my hair every day or dry shampoo the crap out of it. With these pillowcases I wake up with much prettier hair that needs half as much dry shampoo lol. The 'airy blue' color also matches fairly well with my standard 'lake blue' microfiber sheets. They are about 2-3 shades darker than the sheets but I actually like the color dimension as they compliment each other very well. The envelope enclosure is great on these as well. Some 'envelope' styles are quite shallow so unless you have a very full fluffy pillow they will still slide out but with these it is not the case as I have a very slim pillow in one of them and it has stayed within the envelope with no issues of it sneaking out.I will say beware if you have a dog that love pillows. I noticed some scratching/pulling on the fabric today which I assume happened from my 55lb shepsky's claws (which are not sharp by any means actually they're quite dull) or her bringing a bone/rougher toy to chew on the pillow. She's supposed to use the pillows in the normal microfiber cases for lounging and playing but she really loves pillows so there's a chance I didn't see her sneak onto one of these.. I will be more careful now about where I leave these when I'm not using them. Although the scratches could have also happened in the washer as I did just wash them yesterday as well but only with sheets and blankets so there was nothing rough in there with them. It's not super noticeable but could get worse over time. At this price point though, I'm not terribly worried about it.",Great pillowcases especially for the price,Color: Airy BlueSize: 20x26Verified Purchase,

It does have an envelope top which is a great feature but, I can't seem to figure out how to close that enough so the pillow stays in all night. It may work better with a standard pillow type surface. The case itself is gorgeous. Very deep gray color.

Attempted to iron them, but wasn't seeing progress and didn't want to damage the fabric, so I just left it be. I bought them to save my face and hair, so it was a lesser concern. Next wash, I switched from running them on the delicate cycle to permanent press to try and assist with the wrinkling, which seems to have helped over time (I wash about once a week), but new wrinkles form as we lay on them, so I think this will just be something to live with. I'm not mad about it, but if this will bug you, keep it in mind. I also notice that over that time, there are some new marks where the fabric appears to be wearing already (pictured), so these probably won't last a lifetime, but for the price, I'd expect that.
