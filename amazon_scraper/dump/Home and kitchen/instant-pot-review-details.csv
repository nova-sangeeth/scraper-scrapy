Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P.To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan.Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan.Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup.Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying?Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :)********ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets...3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too.Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion.Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from.Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle.In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.",Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT,Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,"1,300 people found this helpful",,,87595,

My problem is that I always forget to take food out of the freezer to thaw.I grabbed a frozen filet and per the directions that I found online I added water and lemon juice to the pot and sprayed the steamer rack with non stick spray. I put the filet on the rack and cooked it for 4 minutes. I didn't use any seasonings. The salmon was perfect and so yummy! I couldn't believe it.Over the weekend I made chili and mac and cheese.

In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle.In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.",Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT,Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,"1,300 people found this helpful",,,62593673,

I mean, I'm all for electronic gadgets in the kitchen.  If I want to cook something for hours until its delicious and tender, I've got a traditional slow cooker.  If I want to feel fancy when I'm preparing perfectly-cooked meats, I've got my Anova sous vide, and a wireless meat thermometer for the grill.  But friends and family were always like, ""Oh but you gotta get an Instant Pot!""  But no, I didn't _have_ to get an Instant Pot.Eventually, though, there was a sale, and I bought one.  Now, I didn't really have any meaningful concept of the differences between the sizes and models.  This 8 quart Duo Plus came up as a daily deal thing, and I bought it.  It was a good price.  And you know, it can make like 2 gallons of yogurt or porridge or something, so...great...whatever.I'll be the first to admit that I didn't count on the sheer size of the thing.  At the time, it was just my wife and I and our two-year-old daughter.  When I unboxed this 8-quart monstrosity, I experienced a moment of trepidation, a fear of ridicule from my wife, who would point out that we don't need a really really ridiculously huge pressure cooker for just us.  But I moved on from that anxiety, and I set about putting this thing to work.The first time each of us used it, we felt what I'm sure every other pressure cooker rookie feels at first—the crippling fear that you're about to die in a horrific high-pressure home explosion, and that your family will always be embarrassed to explain that they were related to one of _those_ statistics.  But, as I'm sure most pressure cooker owners do, we survived.And it didn't take long before we realized (my wife especially, since she does a lot of the cooking) how fantastic this giant culinary autoclave really is.  Cook an entire dinner of roast chicken with red beans & rice in one go?  Done.  Steam a whole mess 'o veggies when some friends show up with their gaggle of kids for dinner?  Easy.  Meatballs.  Tamales.  Artichokes.  Corn on the cob.  All quickly and (perhaps most significantly) very simple.  And there's just a single pot to scrub at the end!  Then just throw it back in the pantry until next time.Last night I think I reached my true peak of giant Instant Pot appreciation.  I cooked two racks of BBQ pork back ribs.  I thought about just taking the meat to my dad's house and letting him do them in the smoker.  But that would have taken like 10 hours!  I could have tried the sous vide, but that would required me to cut up the ribs into ziploc-sized portions, to come up with a way to cook that much meat together in a bigger cooler than I usually use, and to then clean up the mess and cook for at least a few hours to get a good texture.  And who has that kind of time when there's football to be watched and naps to be taken?  Want to know how long I spent preparing this meal in the Instant Pot?  We wanted to eat at 6pm.  I boldly began my process at 5:00.- Five minutes unwrapping and rubbing the meat and stuffing it all into my countertop sauna.  I'll leave the visualization to you.- Twenty minutes as the Instant Pot got up to cooking pressure.- 25 minutes cooking + 2 minutes decompressing (and filling the house with delicious porky aroma)- Five minutes painting on some sauce and letting everything sizzle on the grill.Seriously.  Delicious, perfectly cooked barbecue ribs—enough to feed at least eight people—ready in about an hour.So yeah.  I'm a fan.  And even though it's comically large when we're just cooking for ourselves, I'm glad I got the 8 qt monster after all.  I haven't even explored all of the fancy other options and space-age things it can do.  But I will.  If only because I can.  Thanks, Instant Pot!  <insert smile with tooth sparkle and ""ding"" sound>",It's true.  It makes a lot of things quick and easy.

I was originally leaning towards the PPCXL because that's what my cousin has, but I did some more research and ended with this one, waiting until the Duo Plus came out.  So, since I'm the 4th reviewer, here's some of the thought process I went through in deciding to get the DUO Plus and also some thoughts on the IP vs the PPCXL and also other considerations on accessories, size, etc. So far, I've only had it a few days, but overall satisfied and plenty of online support for recipes and helping you decide the post PC for your needs.**Why I went with the Instant Pot (IP) duo60 Plus -Three new preset buttons - cake, egg, sterilize. It also had the yogurt function which other IP do, but not some of the other makes.Large LCD Screen with  Digital DisplayMute button for those beeps in the night when cooking yogurt etc.Plus / Minus button for both time and pressureKeep Warm Selector can be selected to on or off at anytime.Delay start of 24 hours and keep warm for 10 hours.Lid rest (right or left side)**Why I went with IP vs PPCXL -Food Grade 304 (15/8) stainless steel pot vs stainless steel with teflon coating. I felt I could scrub and treat the pot however I wanted and not worry about scratching and what utensils to not use. Yes, you can buy a replacement inner pot for a Teflon pot, but after I spend $100+ I really don't think I should have to buy a replacement inner pot.  Some of the FB group users are fine with the Teflon pot, but there are also a lot of complaints, so it might be in the handling, but every Teflon pan I ever had eventually got tossed out because of the coating coming off.IP came with some of the accessories you pay for on the PPCXL. It had the trivet with handles, condensation collector, Rice Paddle & spoon and a couple intro guides/cookbooks.Free shipping for IP.  PPCXL site wanted $29.99Buttons weren't quite clear on PPCXL site so it made me think they were hiding lack of selection on preset buttons.  Also, confusing on what you were buying - regular PPC or PPCXL. A lot of their verbiage refers to PPCXL, but not necessarily when you go select your items for your shopping cart.Yogurt Button - The IP has this and the PPCXL doesn't.  The IP allows you to bring the milk to 185 in the IP, cool to 120 (I will be using the quick cool method in the sink) and then put in yogurt mode for incubation (8-12 hours). The PPCXL doesn't have this and you wrap it and put it in the oven.Warranty on IP is 1 year and I went with the Square Trade Warranty for 4 years for an additional $14.37. No deductible, no hidden fees, no shipping, transferable. PPC has 60 day money back/replacement. After that up to one year you have to pay $24.99 for shipping. Their extended warranty if $15 for 3 years.Slow Cooker Mode had a low, medium and high heat button.IP has a + and - sign to increase or decrease the time. Others you have to select a preset and keep pressing to increase, you can't decrease time.Overall ratings - IP 4.7 and PPCXL 4.1.  I read through a lot of comments by verified buyers and the PPC owners seemed a lot more upset with customer service.  I looked through a lot of Reviewers who do this for a living or at least blog and they leaned towards the IP.I messaged with the PPCXL people online and you can tell they've been coached for answers knowing what their down faults are and not really answering the question or referencing what you know is a negative.There are more IPs on the market and most recipes are geared towards it from a ""preset button"" perspective.IP has a left and right handle that will hold your lid tilted.I belong to a Pressure Cooker group - there are a lot of complaints about other manufacturer's instructions, quick start guide, etc. Lots of issues with lids locking, not pressurizing etc and I really don't see this for the Instant Pot family of PCs.**Sizing -I measured my crock pot which was 6 quart, so that's what I ordered.  It's an OK size for 2 people, but since you can only fill it 2/3 full when cooking under pressure you should take that into consideration. I figure on a roast, I will do the meat first, then veggies. The 6 quart will hold four pint canning jars for sterilization.**Accessories -What else to buy?  I got the OXO Good Grips steamer with extendable handle and a pack of 3-IP Rings color coded (dark for savory meats, orange for desserts and I will use the clear for yogurt).  I had read they were dishwasher safe, but not 100% as they might keep flavors.On my next order I'm looking at 2 cookbooks (IP Electric Pressure Cooker Cookbook for $9 and IP Obsession for $12). There are plenty of Facebook Group pages you can join for recipes too and online reviewers. Just type in what you are making followed by ""in a pressure cooker"" or ""in an IP"". I'm also buying IP Silicone Mitts for easy removal of a hot pot since I will be making yogurt ($10).The only negative of the Instant Pot is you can't get a 10 quart and if I had a REALLY big family that would be the only reason, but basedon the above, I would probably just buy a 2nd Instant Pot.I hope this is helpful.  I did a lot of research and felt the need to share it. I will update this as I use it and get additional questions.8/9/2017 update - I've been using my IP for a few months now.  I use my steamer basket and trivet a lot. I make a ""bowl"" out of heavy duty foil and put on the trivet when making a whole chicken and it makes trivet clean-up easier.  I bought an IP plain glass lid for slow cooker & yogurt mode.  I don't use my extra rings cause I use my plain lid for yogurt, so no use to swap rings.  I didn't get the silicone mitts. I realized I didn't need them. My inner pot doesn't get that hot on yogurt mode. I like the 2 cookbooks.  I use Bar Keeper Friend to clean the pot.  Still really happy with my IP-DUO Plus 60. I'm part of a FB PC group and I don't see complaints on the IP. Very happy with my purchase.12/29/2017 update - So on Black Friday I bought the 3 qt Instant Pot because I felt like I need to have twins.  It's a great size and great forsides and especially my 2 quart of yogurt I make at least weekly, so it doesn't tie up my 6 qt IP. We winter in FL and I was able to ""sneak"" the6 qt into the truck and now I have the 3 qt here too. I made an entire Thanksgiving dinner for Christmas (Irma got in our way last month repairing) in the 2 pots. In future years, I'll prob just bring the 3 qt cause it fits better in my cabinets in the mobile home.","Why I bought the Instant Pot IP-DUO Plus60 9-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker, 6 Qt",Size: 6-QTStyle: Duo PlusPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,"4,257 people found this helpful",4845,16,249784,Public

Mitchell,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHY74TNSVM6QK3CM5QRGK3XLACNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2016",0,51,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B085HK33BN/ref=zg_bs_home-garden_cr_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=NMKBVV9JCWSVR5H0M3AB&pageNumber=2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that.So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes.First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out.The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit)For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons).The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want.After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure.The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release.All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time.Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes.Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance).Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start.Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post).Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot.Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.)Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot.You definitely will want   this steamer basket           for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket.Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get   this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set          .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile.Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time).For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass.If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel   pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set          , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them.You will also want this separate   glass lid           that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it.In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception:  Pressure Cooker Perfection          I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!):  Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes          And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one:  O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free          ..and this one:  Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker          And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes.Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude.Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes!Happy Instant Potting!",I LOVE My Instant Pot!

After the meal was over I began cleaning immediately. There were parcels of meat stuck on the bottom so I took a soft cloth and a pinch of comet to clean it off. It removed not only the meat but it also removed all the finish off the bottom of the insert. It was totally gone and looked horrible.

Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below.Updated: 9/26/2017I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it.It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then!There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience.I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot.I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP.I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though.Now to some specific tips:Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below.Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order.I use the   RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket           for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though).I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot.   Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red          . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend.I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the   Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch           which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware.Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features.

Not until they sent me one from different stock did I get a properly functioning one.  LOOK OUT for faulty steam release valve/handles.  If you have the steam release handle pointing to the “sealing” position, steam should NOT be escaping from it while you do the “water test” and the pot comes up to pressure, or while it is cooking at pressure.  You should only be having steam escape out of that valve when you turn it toward “venting.”  This is seperate from the pink float valve.  It is normal for some steam to escape from the pink float valve until it pops up & the pot comes to pressure.If the steam only stops coming out of the steam release valve/handle by pushing it past the spot marked “sealing,” where it feels like it’s NOT supposed to go, or if it keeps coming out no matter what you do, then learn from me: YOU have a DEFECTIVE one!  When I talked with the Instant Pot technical support with my last one, they told me to turn it off, unplug it, and not attempt to use it again.I ordered mine during the pre-holiday/ Black Friday sales (Nov 2017).  The first I was shipped came badly dented in (probably shipping damage since the outside box was bashed in, too.)  The next two I was sent were BOTH defective.  It wasn’t until I requested I be sent a replacement from different stock, that I got a properly functioning one!  I’m so relieved to finally have a functioning one as of today, January 29th, 2018, two months later!  4th time’s the charm, I guess?  Seriously, it took them sending me 4 Instant Pots, and a lot of headache & my time before I got a properly functioning one.  I will say, that they did at least cover the shipping (as was Amazon’s responsibility since it was an Amazon fulfilled order) for all the replacements, and did even over-night ship one of the times (the third pot...by the fourth, I got the sense the customer service person suspected it was MY fault, so they seemed less eager to help.  I do have pictures & proof of the problematic units they shipped me, and verification that it was NOT user error or my fault.  I’m just so relieved that my 4th one works so I don’t have to deal with this anymore!)So, Quality Control Issues.IF you get a functioning unit, these really are nice.  Seems everyone around me has one & loves them.  I may not have figured out that my second unit was defective, if it hadn’t been for me brining it to a group get-together where two other friends cooked the exact same recipe (with no problem) in their Instant Pots, while mine malfunctioned with it because of the defective steam release valve/handle, which caused the subsequent “burn” code when trying to come up to pressure.  I had suspected it might be defective before, but was having a hard time ruling out novice user error, or bad recipes, etc.Pictures: 1) First one came dented in.  2 & 3) pictures from one of the units with defective steam release valve, in case Instant Pot sees this and wants that info. to help correct manufacturing/quality control problem.  4) Shows manual saying that the problem indicates “pressure control fails”and to “contact support.”  Also shows where I wrote ticket number from my call with Instant Pot technical support.If I knew how to post videos, I have video of what it looks & sounds like doing the “water test” with the defective steam release valve.  Basically, it noisily spits steam and water out the steam release valve, even when it is in “sealing” position.Hope my very bad luck helps things go better for someone else, especially if there are any other defective units still getting shipped to people!",Defective Units/ Steam Release Valves,Size: 8-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,173 people found this helpful,134,42,78908538,Public

I love to cook & we always seek vacation  lodgings w kitchenettes. But something odd happened when I did the Instant Pot's ""initial test run"" as described in the user's manual. (3 c. water, set at ""steam"") Steam kept leaking from the closed vent, and when the cycle finished and I allowed a ""natural"" release of pressure, a big puddle formed on my counter.

AM and after waiting 10 min., the fellow on the support line couldn't tell what was going on, but said DO NOT use the pot. He also said to do the ""initial test run"" again, and video the results to show the problem, then take pictures of the seals on the back and the bottom of the pot, and the puddle after use. I was to email all of this, with a description of the problem, to ""technical support"" at Instant Pot. Between the time I made the phone call, did the ""initial test run"" took the videos and photos, wrote up the problem, and emailed it all, I had invested almost 4 hours of my time. My vacation time!! No response from Instant pot for all of Tues. Later on Wed. I finally got an email--requesting a video of the problem and photos of the seals. Clearly nobody had looked at the materials I had already, painstakingly, sent.  Resent the video and photos, and again heard nothing for over a day. Fri. I .called again, reviewed the situation & my frustration. I was promised a phone call from technical support before end of day. Surprise! No. Phone. Call. It was the weekend again--so nobody at Instant Pot was working. On Mon. I returned the pot to Amazon--having lost the opportunity to cook on vacation.

It has worked well enough I purchased a 6 quart Instant Pot to make it easier to make recipes from the various cookbooks that are around for these devices. Most seem geared toward 6 quart sizes. My only additional advice is perhaps consider a 6 quart size if you want to make some of those recipes, otherwise the 4 quart is just fine for 1-2 people, maybe 4 people for a single serving each, with a bit left over.Purchased ""Instant Pot DUO Plus 3 Qt 9-in-1 Multi- Use Programmable Pressure Cooker"" through Amazon from Stelli Products, delivered May 27 2019, temporarily failed this morning July 13 2019, but then started again. Maybe.The idea of an electric pressure cooker combined with a slow and other cooker is great. I have used stove-top pressure cookers for years, (Fagor),  as well as many and various slow and rice cookers. Having a programmed pressure cooker, like the rice and slow cookers, takes a lot of the worry about overcooking away from pressure cooking.I have been using this for about 6 weeks now, though only the slow and pressure cooking features, there are pluses and minuses.Pluses:Stainless steel inner pot without coatings takes concern about adverse effects from non-stick coatings away, and is easily cleanable with worrying too much about damage.Ability to have multiple pot liners ready is a plus, though I have not done that, I plan to.It seems to work very well when it works.Space-saving and versatility: It takes up no space on the stove, and can be used on any level surface anywhere the power cord can reach,  so if your cooking a bunch of dishes you have an extra spot on the stove if you need one, while the cooker can be running somewhere else, even another room.Minuses:The condensation collector cup pops off way too easy.Cleanup of the outer rim is slightly annoying with all the nooks and crannys, this could be designed better.It also seems a bit delicate. This morning I filled it up with a chili recipe, set it to slow cook for 8 hours, it started but then the screen went blank. While mixing up the recipe in the pot some splashed over the rim and about a half teaspoon of the liquid got inside between the pot and the main cooker base. I unplugged, removed the liner and wiped that down with a damp towel, and cleaned out the main pot best I could, all using a damp kitchen towel. The pot lit up, seemed to start, then went blank. It would not light up  or start after that, until about a half hour later just before I sent an email to Instant Brands asking about repairs. Now it is lighting up so I will use it again another day and see if it works. But at this point the chili is sitting in my 10 year old Panasonic SR-TMB10 rice/slow cooker, which has worked flawlessly since I bought it from Amazon in April 2009.Suggestions and advice on use:Mix up recipes outside of the cooker and place in the inner pot before placing the inner pot inside the cooker base to avoid spills getting inside the main cooker base.For slow cooking beef, as in a stew, use the highest setting. The medium setting did not do the job for me even after more than 6 hours.For pressure cooking beef, as in a stew, use the normal setting as listed in the recipe booklet. This produced a very nice and tender stew.Suggestions to Instant Brands:The design needs to be improved where the inner and outer pot meet to better avoid spills leaking inside. Splashing happens.Access to clean the base both inside and rim area could also be improved.A way to better store the included utensils, either on or inside the cooker would be a good idea IMO. See the rice cooker mentioned above, and others, for examples. I have enough clutter in my kitchen drawers, and it is too easy to misplace parts or accessories that are stored separately.The condensation collector needs to be more securely attached to the cooker, there are many better design examples on rice cookers from many sources.","Great idea, overall decent, but seems a bit delicate",Size: 3-QTStyle: Duo PlusPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,67 people found this helpful,,,1555502,

It would try but the temperature of the liquid in the pot was in the 150-160 degree range rather than 180-200 range.  After discussion with IP customer service, the pot was replaced with a new V3 model in January.Unfortunately, the V3 IP appears to have the same or worse problems as did the V2 it replaced.  Our efforts to use it as a pressure cooker have resulted in ""Burn"" warnings for recipes we've used for years without problems.  Unfortunately, it also appears to be useless as a slow cooker.  Today I nearly ruined a simple pot roast because after 3 hours the slow cook function stopped heating even though the control panel showed that operations were normal.I'm sure that the folks at IP will offer me a new pot; frankly, at this point I just want my money back. In the past 6 months I've ruined quite a few dinners because of cooking failures.  This is totally unacceptable and I hate to have to hover over my cooking utensil to ensure that it is working correctly.  If I can get my money back I'm going to buy a Breville.  Yes, it costs more but in this case I think you may well get what you pay for!",No longer the product it once was,Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,91 people found this helpful,,,40984,

Its a pressure cooker and a slow cooker, but they try to sell it as so much more.  Most of the functions and buttons on here are superfluous.  And the worst part as a chef, is that it takes away a lot of the control you have over cooking.  My first stew in there was a disaster...veggies turned to mush...and the lid was pressure locked so there was no way for me to get them out. With a traditional pressure cooker you have the option of running cold water over the lid and using a quick release method in those cases.My other issue is that it takes a LONG time to come to pressure. My regular, stove top pressure cooker (Kuhn Rikon) takes between 5-7 minutes generally to come to pressure. This one can take as long as 15-17 minutes, and even longer if anything is frozen inside.  That means that food is rapidly boiling/cooking before the pressure timer even starts. And then you have to also adjust for the amount of time your food is just locked away ....boiling/cooking away long after the pressure timer is over.All in all, people are raving about these pots, and the one thing I do love about it - is that I can set something in there and forget about it if its something like dried beans or rice on the rice setting.  Just add ingredients, click the lid, push a button and walk away. Thats a great function for busy moms I'm sure.I'm a chef, so of course I can figure out how to use any cooking device/tool and make something delicious.

If I am to believe the internet (a tenuous proposition to begin with), as soon as we owned an Instant Pot, our entire world would improve - from better dental hygiene to more confidence in job interviews.  I'd win friends and influence enemies.  My bowling score would be way up and my mini golf score would be way down.  It all sounded a little too good to be true.But...when the rice cooker died, there happened to be a really good sale going on with Instant Pots, so we splurged.  A typical rice cooker would likely have cost half an Instant Pot, but hey, who doesn't want lower mini golf scores?  It was worth trying.  I have yet to go to the dentist since we got the Instant Pot, but I can report that this thing is pretty darn amazing.  The rice it makes is fabulous.  Potatoes are cooked in 15 minutes.  We don't need to soak beans overnight because this thing can cook them right out of the bag.  Things that we wouldn't typically cook because they are time- and effort-intensive are well within reach on a weeknight.  We are converts.The Instant Pot seems to be well-built.  For what it's worth, since it is a pressure cooker, it really needs to be well-built if the company expects not to be hit with a lawsuit.  This thing can boil water in no time, however.  I'm not sure how it can heat that quickly.  My first guess is that it's sucking mass from the nearest star, but as I stated above, we can make potato soup - start to finish - in about 30 minutes.  Two cups of dry brown rice is ready to eat in less time than that.  We have not tried it as a slow cooker, since we don't eat many dishes well-suited to slow cooking, but I have little doubt this would do it.  Now we need to buy one of those books with vegetarian Instant Pot dishes in it.

So after much deliberation, I ordered an Instant Pot last Monday.I was hesitant because I'd recently purchased a Dutch oven and a sous vide immersion circulator and three different blenders before deciding that I should probably stop buying kitchen appliances considering I hardly even cook and generally consume most of my meals in a nutrient sludge meal replacement (that plug will have to wait for another day). But ultimately my unbridled consumerism and constant hunger for new gadgets won out (they always do in the end) and before I knew it, I had a 6-quart Instant Pot 9-in-1 DUO Plus sitting on my counter.Being that it was 11pm on a Wednesday night by this point, I decided I would wait until the next day to try out my new toy.But being that I was extremely hungry for both food and instant gratification, I immediately changed my mind and brought out a chuck roast I had been thawing for this very occasion.This was the test, you see. The electronic, pressurized crucible. Could this shiny, button-covered cylinder the size of a large rice cooker make a pot roast faster than my slow cooker? Surely it couldn't make it as *well*, but could it get at least 85% of the way there in a fraction of the time?Turned out the answer was a resounding ""yes"". In fact, the meat was exactly the way I like it, tender but still slightly firm. Easily pulled apart, but not yet a tasteless mush. And the whole process took about an hour and a half, including the time it took to brown the roast and pressurize/depressurize the pot.From that moment, I was completely sold. See, the problem I had with even just a pot roast in a slow cooker was that I always ended up having to plan my day around it. It wasn't enough to just dump in the ingredients and let them sit. I'd found that 6 hours was too short, but 8 hours was too long. I needed to leave it in for 7 hours, but my workday was 8 hours long, not even counting the commute. Plus I had to add in the vegetables 2-3 hours before the end so that they would cook but not have all the nutrients obliterated into a mush.Thus, pot roasts were for weekends. But even then, if I wanted a pot roast for dinner, I had to get up early and do all the prep, just to let it sit for hours while I salivated in torment. And I had to make sure I was there at the end to turn it off.The Instant Pot eliminates most of these issues. I can set a timer for when I want it to start. I can set a cook time, after which it will either turn off or go into a ""Keep Warm"" mode. I can dump ingredients in the pot in the morning (though probably not something with raw meat) and have them freshly cooked and ready to eat right when I get home at night.I made the pictured beef stew earlier and cooking only took about an hour. Without a pressure cooker, it would have taken several hours. I'm seriously considering bringing this thing to work and just cooking my lunch there. I mean, why not? Assuming I have ingredients prepared, making a meal in this would be easier than making a sandwich.I've only made two things in it so far, but I'm already really digging this thing. Four years ago, I bought a slow cooker and it was probably the best thing I'd ever bought myself up to that point. My Instant Pot is shaping up to take up that mantle.There's a lot of hype around the Instant Pot. People describe it as ""magic"". It's not magic-- it's food science. But when you can reduce a several-hour cook time down to about an hour, is there really a difference?(Note: I realize this review, especially that last paragraph, probably sounds like I'm some paid, professional reviewer, but I assure you I am neither paid nor professional; I just really dig this thing and I'm a decent writer. Not that I would turn down a company who wants to send me free stuff to give my honest opinion on! ;) )",Everything's shiny so far!,Size: 6-QTStyle: Duo PlusPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,341 people found this helpful,,,118229,

I am now one of its biggest promoters. I LOVE this thing. I think that I've only used my stove and oven a couple of times since I got an IP. I had the 6-quart at first and when I realized how much I was using it and needed a bigger one, I got the 8-quart and gave the 6 to my SIL for Christmas.PROS:You can cook almost anything in it. So far, I've done chicken breasts and wings, burgers, collard greens, turkey breast (for Thanksgiving), and a yogurt cheesecake. INo heating up the kitchen (in the summer, this will be really important)Less cleanup (Basically it's just what you fit into the IP)Easily moved and stored out of the wayAttractive to look at and you won't mind leaving it on your counters (if you have the room)Quiet operation.Has a Delay Start button. I find this perfect for most days. It's like that old saying of  ""set it and forget it"".CONS:The Steam button confuses every new user. If it's up, you don't want to open it. (** On the 8-qt model the button stand way high out of the hole when cooking.  I have attached photos showing the button positions on the *8 Quart model ONLY*)You will most likely need more accessories. I got a set of Pot-in-Pot pans and still would like to have more IP items.Can be awkward to remove foods/pans from the pot. Most people have learned to make slings out of foil or string.The steam release can be confusing & scary to new users. Basically ""quick release"" is using something to lift the steam nozzle to let the steam shoot out fast until the button pops down. ""Slow Release"" is when you just let the food sit for a while when it's finished cooking. I do this when I am cooking ahead of time. The main thing is to learn what position the button needs to be in on your model before you attempt to remove the lid.It does not brown or crisp foods. You can get some result on some foods using the Saute function but using the oven or air fryer to finish is bestLike most people, I didn't even use my IP for a few days after getting it because I was so scared of the thing. I joined a Facebook group and did a lot of online research before I finally took a chance. Now that I've used the IP, I can't imagine being without it.A couple of notes I wish I'd known before:1. The difference in size is important. I started with a 6-qt and moved up to the 8-qt and I'm cooking mainly for oneThis is a great photo showing the difference in sizes is courtesy online of ""Mama Shire""2. Do make notes of temps and times for things you cook. I put my notes in my cookbook and a copy on the fridge. Not everyone else's times and temps worked for me.3. You can use the handle of a wooden spoon or something to do a quick steam release.4. For some reason, I need to use more seasonings when cooking in the IP with the lid on. That, or adding a little oil on top of seasonings seems to help.5. There are recipes for cakes and bread, etc online. Take time to experiment and don't just stick to the pressure cooking button.6. For browning some foods, the Saute function is really useful.7. If you preheat IP with the Saute function while prepping food, the machine gets ready faster when you start to cook.8. That Steam/Vent switch is not meant to be tight as I thought it should be. I thought mine was broken because it was so loose. Nope. It's just like that. You simply turn the thing toward Steam when getting ready to cook/pressurize. When done, if you want to do a  quick release and open the pot, that is when you use something to lift the switch to let the steam escape. Or you can just wait until it finishes releasing on its one and the nozzle drops back into place.",Deserves every bit of the hype,Size: 8-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,40 people found this helpful,102,42,1196025,Public

How did this pass quality control?  The ""QC passed"" sticker on the bottom is an obvious lie.  I had to open a ticket with instant pot and waiting on their technician to tell us what to do.UPDATE:  2 days since we received our defective pot and no response from customer service.  what a waste.  DO NOT BUYUPDATE 2:  It has been a full week and we still don't have a new base.  We finally heard from customer service last Friday, a full 3 days after submitting our ticket.  We were told a new base would be sent to use because the error can't be fixed.  I was assured a new base would be sent to use and we should keep the other parts from the original one.  I expected the new base to be shipped yesterday but it was not.  I emailed customer service again and was told there's  ""a slight delay in fulfilling our warranty shipments"".  I should have just returned it to amazon and gotten another one.  What a waste.  Do not buy!UPDATE 3:  Now nine days after the faulty cooker arrived.  Emailed customer service again asking why the new base hasn't been shipped.  Just got a reply that ""Currently these bases are out of stock. They will be available by the end of next week and shipped out as soon as possible the week after.""  I am livid.  I should have just returned it.  I hate instant pot.Update 4:  Returned the pot to amazon and was sent a brand new one that arrived today.  Lesson learned: if your product dies before 30 days, just return to amazon.  Don't try to use their crappy customer service until you have to.  And even then, good luck getting anywhere with it.  They wanted me to wait 3 full weeks to get a new base.  Tried the initial setup on the new one and so far, it seems to be working.  I'm pretty sure it will die again because these things do not seem well made at all.  They didn't even want me to return the faulty one which either means 1) they know its so cheap that it's not worth fixing it and/or 2) they are so overwhelmed with issues that they don't have time to figure out what went wrong.",Crappy Product - error C6L right out of the box,Size: 6-QTStyle: Duo PlusPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,49 people found this helpful,,,217636,

He has an old-time huge steel stove-top pressure cooker that he uses on occasion, but for some reason it scares the crap out of me so I figured I would not be afraid to use the Instant Pot.  I bought the mini since it is just us.  My first try with it was a pot roast.  I bought a 2.5 lb roast, which left just enough room for the vegetables.  I followed the cooking timer table in the recipe book that came with the Instant Pot.  It said 15 minutes per lb for a roast, so I set the timer for 45 minutes just to give it a tad more time.  It actually took close to an hour and 15 minutes before it was ready, as I checked it and turned it back on, but still better than roasting it all day in the oven and heating up the house.  I then threw the vegetables in and in 10 minutes we had a great dinner!  I am looking forward to trying some different recipes and maybe coaxing my husband to use it.Pros:*Even though I bought the mini, it was larger than I thought it would be; just enough for dinner for 2 and leftovers the next day.*Super easy to clean; just throw the stainless steel pan in the dishwasher and easily wipe down the rest with a damp cloth.*Quiet!  Once you plug it in and turn it on, you can't even hear it.Cons:*Extra parts that are needed are super expensive, and some not available at all for the mini.  They could have thrown in a little steamer basket instead of a bunch of goofy plastic accessories that I won't even use.*The cord is a little short, at only 36 inches.*The steam release valve seems flimsy, but it does the job.

Is it really just a glorified rice cooker? If there is a place that really knows how to make perfect rice, it would be China. Which is why I think its appropriate that this cooker is make there.But its more than just a rice cooker. This pot has 7 different functions, and a plethora of recipes that can be concocted in those 7 functions. Its like an experimental cook’s dream machine. If you are familiar with a pressure cooker, this is exactly that, it has the pressure release valve that will scare the (*#!&) out of you every single time you switch it over. But don’t let that intimidate you out of this purchase. This is better than a crock pot, in that you can cook some of the same meals, like beans or pot roast in a fraction of the time.No, its not instant, so, don’t get mad that your dry beans didn’t cook in 30 minutes, because that’s not realistic, but they will get done much faster than stovetop or crockpot. Now, lets talk about space. I have an RV, and this is perfect for making so many meals in this small kitchen space. Maybe you have a great big kitchen in a house and this is just another gadget that you can’t justify adding. I can understand that. But, if you already use the crockpot, rice cooker, and make lots of beans, maybe this would be a good upgrade to your kitchen appliances.So, here I am, joining your mom, friend, and the internet into trying to talk you into buying your own instant pot.

I just read some tips and may switch to using the slow cook for cakes. So far I made brownies (dry but my fault as I followed my gut instincts on ingredients), cheesecake (not bad) and (failed) cornbread.

Forced to wait on my 2 day prime delivery, I ordered from Amazon. Finally it arrived Monday prior to lunch. I rushed out and bought a chuck roast to christen it with. I scoured the instant pot recipes I had found on Facebook and found one to try. What would take hours in the oven or crock pot took about 1 hour total in the instant pot. Next day I boiled eggs in it. Push a button, walk away, no worries about water coming to a boil or how long you leave the eggs in the pot. They peel better than any egg I've ever boiled. Next I cooked a turkey breast. It was still partially frozen and was done in an hour and a half start to finish. I've made bone broth in it as well. Again you just push a button and let it do it's thing. No need to stick around and watch a pot boil. It's fabulous and I can see this becoming one of my favorite kitchen items of all time.

The company told me it sounded like a blown fuse.  Unfortunately, they use a proprietary screw to access the fuse and I would not be able to change it myself.  Therefore, they recommended I purchase a new Instant Pot.  To make the new purchase less painful, the company’s representative said she would send me an invoice to my email address with a small price reduction.  Yet, I never received the invoice.  She told me to check my junk folder (but it wasn’t there).  The funny thing is that the customer service rep could send me emails each day and I would receive them.  But, whenever she would send me an email with the reduced-price invoice, it would, mysteriously, not make it to me.  I suspect she was just testing my patience (and she won).  I ended up paying full price for a new Instant Pot.In short, the product is awesome, but the company appears to have a greed component.  The Instant Pot is definitely well-made and should stand up to many years of use—if not for the fuse that’s designed to fail right after the warranty expires.  If you can’t tolerate this type of behavior from a company, then don’t buy this product.

I've used it three times so far and in each case the prep + cook time was probably around 40% less than if I'd cooked using traditional methods - this includes clean-up too, as I'm only cleaning one pot out later on.Then there is the versatility.  Meat, poultry, baking, soups, stews, whatever - I can use it as a crock pot, use it to saute things, etc.  Last night I did a beef roast - seared the roast in the Instant Pot with some salt and garlic, added beef broth, added veggies, and then closed that sucker up to pressure cook it all.  Because the pressure cooker keeps all the flavor locked in, I used less seasoning than I normally do, letting the various food's natural flavors shine through.  The meat was tender and everything was flavorful - and because everything was done in just one pot, cleanup was simple.If there is one drawback - when pressure cooking the pot takes awhile to build up the heat and pressure.  This means that you have to factor this time into your cooking schedule - I haven't actively measured it, but it seems to be about 10~15 minutes additional time which sort of sucks if you haven't planned ahead.I'm looking forward to doing more things in it; so far just the beef roast, turkey tenderloin, and boiled eggs, but I'm impressed so far.",I quite like this...,Size: 8-QTStyle: Duo PlusPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,39 people found this helpful,,,35896,

First, I was under the impression the only difference in the 6 and 8 was size. The 8 quart requires more water or liquid to reach pressure (2-2.5 cups vs. the 1-1.5 cups for the 6 qt)-- this can affect many recipes that call for only 1 cup of liquid! The 8 qt is really for cooking larger quantities, but I thought I could cook smaller portions in it too, and you can but, again, you have to add more liquid than some recipes require. You can get around this by doing PIP (pot in pot) cooking, but what a hassle if you want to sear or sauté something--you would have to do that in the inner pot, then transfer everything to the PIP smaller pot (which you have to figure out what to use and buy it), you can then add the amount of liquid to your dish, and if it is not 2 cups, then you would add 1 cup of water to the inner pot itself, so, combined you have enough liquids to reach pressure. The 8 qt, because it holds more, takes longer to release pressure naturally (and maybe a little longer with quick release, too). It is a wonderful size, and I thought it would be versatile, allowing me to cook large or small portions, but I am cooking for two and this is just too big since it requires the extra liquid. I exchanged it for a Duo60 without doing anything more than the Pressure Test. Please note, I spoke with customer service at Instant Pot because the Manual says the Pressure Test natural release time would be 15 minutes and it took 55! They said the manual has a misprint, the ""3 mark"" should read 3rd mark, not the number 3 because the 3 is 3 liters and the 3rd Mark is 3 cups, so yes, big difference. I thought the pot was defective, so was glad I called. Very nice people!! I gave the 8qt 4 stars because it is a wonderful appliance, the -1 star was for not explaining the differences better so people can make a more informed decision on which size to buy.

Here are some suggestions for the manufacturer:1. the rubber (or silicone) pad under each foot is way too small, it cannot hold on a smooth granite counter top. To press a button, you have to hold the cooker using one hand, push the buttons using another hand. More importantly, the cooker may slide off the counter top easily when serving food.2. the little stem with a silicone cap in the lid: in a busy home, you don't expect to watch every small parts which may drop out and get lost. Unfortunately, the silicone cap seems to be easy to rub off from the stem when washing the lid by hand. Cuisinart cooker doesn't have such small loose parts.3. The lid top: why the metal top is not covered by plastic? I agree it looks cool with a shining metal top, but it doesn't make sense to prioritize the visual appeal above safety.

Seeing as this is the second return I am making I am a bit peeved and not impressed with the build quality on the electronics at least. It a useful and great product when it works, but I am not going to stick with them if this keeps happening.  I do use the pot frequently but not daily, and expect it to last at least a few years especially considering  they are one of the most expensive pressure cookers on the market.Hey IP-- you aren't the only ones who make a nice pressure cooker and I can go elsewhere.

Downside is there's no glass lid, but cooks contents in a shorter amount of time.What the insta-pot is really good at is being a rice porridge maker. Makes rice porridge way better than my Zojirushi rice cooker. This is the main use I have for the insta pot at the moment, aside from some soup recipes.For actual use, it's very easy. You get used very quickly to it like trying to program a new microwave.Note when done cooking you have to release pressured air, before you can open the lid.Opted for the 3 quart over the 6 or 8 quart since those were too bulky and takes up too much space in the kitchen. 3 quart is perfect for a 1-4 person household.Overall, will not replace several appliances in your kitchen, but has it's uses.","Jack Of All Trades, Master of Some.",Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,17 people found this helpful,32471,2051,62593673,Public

It’s a nice unit that does a lot of cooking chores. I’m very happy that it’s stainless, not aluminum inside the cooking pot. However, I don’t think I will be using it very often. Chicken does steam easily and quickly so it’s good for shredded chicken. But having to pre-brown things before cooking is a nuisance. Also the cook times are crazy—nothing in any of the books match..each one tells you something different. At one point it says to never turn it on without 32oz of liquid in the pot. The directions seem to be written by people who don’t all speak the same language because measurements aren’t consistent and they use recipes referring to buttons this doesn’t have(good luck looking for that program button to pressure cook!) Even accounting for lousy instructions, the finished products are never what I’d hoped for. Brown rice turned out a bit al denté than I like...and you can’t make any adjustments while it’s cooking..it just comes out however and you can deal or start over. I think if you do a lot of ‘pot’ style meals, like soup, this would be lovely. But it doesn’t replace my AirFryer that can do literally anything—only downside is that’s all aluminum and the coating comes off really easily..so the Instant Pot wins for having the stainless steel pot...but there’s nothing I want to cook in it. Overall not for me, and I’ll prob re-gift this to someone.Update 5/7/20: I’ve discovered this will cook rice quickly and effectively. Brown rice is 12 minutes, jasmine is 4. Cooking chicken for shredding is easy and quick. However, there’s nothing else u can cook in it. Literally everything burns regardless of how much liquid u use. I hate this thing and only am keeping it bc I eat a lot of rice and this makes rice in no time...but it simply is the worst at anything else. Even chili!! How do u possibly burn chili??? This can and does. I need to get my slow cooker out of storage bc this thing even burns if u use the slow cook function. Basically it’s an overpriced rice maker.

I cleaned and checked the sealing ring as well as float valve; the float valve still does not pop for the pressure. Finally I contacted amazon customer service, they immediately told me there in nothing to do with them that I need to contact manufacture myself if it is under the warranty.

I spent my time did all that in my very busy schedules. Guess what, He replied email said that everything is fine. We cannot do anything for you at this point, but if you want to purchase another one, we can compensate you with $10 coupon.

After just scanning through it and viewing the prep times, it was obvious that this is not a time saver.  We made beef stroganoff, which normally would take about 25 minutes, but with the ""Instant Pot"", it took 10 minutes to gather steam and then 25 minutes to cook and then about 20 minutes to clean up.There is no handle for the inner pot, so on our first try, we miscalculated our grip and spilled the stroganoff all over the floor.  It needs a handle.The design is such that it is easy for food to get into all of the nooks and crannies built into the pot.  Impossible to really clean.The book is not kidding about having several of the plastic seals, because they absorb smells that can never go away.The advertisement says the cooker does not steam up the room or release odors.  We had steam all over the kitchen, and the odors have to go somewhere.  They did.  Into the kitchen as well.  That was even before we opened the lid to take out the food.  If used with any food that has grease in it, like hamburger, the kitchen will soon be covered with grease from the mist that spews into the room.My feeling is that this ""gadget"" appeals to people who think that the cute buttons actually mean that they can just push a button and have the meal printed on the top of the button.  It's great for people who have no idea how to cook in the first place, and it gives the perception that little cooking knowledge is needed.As usual with Chinese manufactured products, they don't make any effort to make a manual that ordinary American-English speaking people can understand.  Right off the bat, we did the First Time Use section.  It explained a little about how to start it and build a head of steam for pressure cooking and then dropped us off a cliff by not explaining what to do after it is pressurized.  It needs at least one more paragraph to finish that section.Remember to add at least 50-100% more time to clean the pot after you are done cooking.  And, if you drop the pot, add a couple of hours to remove the grease all over the floor.This is an example of whiz-bang technology that has a lot of promise, but is much less useful than the user would think.  It does NOT save time in cooking.  Just go to the internet, find a recipe and cook it in your pot or pan.

I have used a pressure cooker and canner for years, but this seemed to promise easier meals and it was a huge draw to me that the pot was stainless steel and not aluminum like my other pressure cookers.  Other than the stainless steel factor, though, it's just a glorified pressure cooker, which I can understand would be a draw to people who have not used pressure cookers before.  I didn't use it very much because it was a clunky appliance and I don't have counter space for it, so it had to be put away each time, and honestly it didn't do anything that a good ol' basic pressure cooker does except turn off after a certain amount of time and get to the correct pressure on its own.However, I would not have left a review at all except a few weeks ago I went to use it and plugged it in, and... nothing.  No power at all.  No lights, nothing.  It had rarely been used, always cleaned up right after use and put away dry, always cared for well.  I had it filled up with ingredients to make chicken stock and it wouldn't even turn on.  I tried everything - different outlets, looking for a reset button, removing everything and putting it back together again..  nothing.  I was sure it was something simple so I got online and looked up problem solving, tried everything I could find... nothing.  I moved everything to a regular pot on the stove and simmered it the regular way, and contacted instant pot customer service.  I told them it was past the warranty but that I had only used it a handful of times, and they sent me an email with a list of detailed photos to take and send them.  The rim, the inside, the outside, several stickers, a picture of it plugged in, the control panel, the pot with a ruler laying across it to show that it is still level, photos to assure that there was no damage caused by me, etc.  So I took all these photos and sent them over, which took a good bit of time but since they knew it was past the warranty and still asked for the photos, I figured they were standing behind their product since it was obviously defective.  I got a reply email saying they hadn't received all the photos.  I resent them.  I got a reply saying that  it looks like the cooker base is dead and their suggestion was that I purchase a new one.  ???  First, why did I go through all the trouble of demonstrating that it was truly dead if they weren't going to do anything about it?  And second, why in the world would I purchase a whole new instant pot when it completely stopped working after only a few times, and has such poor customer service?  Are there people who are really so gullible that they will just repurchasing poor quality products, and expensive ones at that?  I am extremely frustrated with the company and with myself for falling for this overpriced gadget.  My recommendation - get a good ol' fashioned pressure cooker with no bells and whistles, no electronic dashboard or computer chip, no beeping noises of flashing lights.  It will last you a lifetime.

I guess a long cylinder such as a garden hose would be measured by Length and Width (aka diameter), but a pot would be width (or diameter) and height....I don't know if the company-provided 16.8"" and 16.34"" measurements each refer to the width of the outside pot/unit or not...it's slightly wider in one direction because of the two handles...slightly more narrow in the other direction without the handles.  I really don't care what these measurements refer to at this point...the company has simply failed at providing useful measurements.For those obsessed with more accurate details (for storage reasons), I measure the heavy, outside, instant pot unit itself to be about 16.5"" wide (handle to handle) and about 15"" tall from the bottom feet to the top of the top handle.  By the way...it is indeed heavy...definitely a potential safety hazard for some people to store it in upper cabinets vs lower cabinets because of the weight...The most important part to me was the size of the 10 quart INSERT itself...ie, the stainless steel container.  I'd say it's 6.5"" TALL by 11"" WIDE (this width refers to the *inside* diameter of the insert, not the outside diameter of the flange/rim of the insert)...the inside diameter is more important.btw...it's important to remember that even though the stainless steel insert is considered to be a 10 quart size, you should not cook with it completely full to the 10-quart capacity....it should only be filled 2/3 of the way...the instructions or others can explain why.-Spike",Here they are: Photos and measurements of the actual 6 qt vs 10 qt sizes of InstantPots and inserts.,Size: 10-QTStyle: Duo NovaPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,9 people found this helpful,,,78630032,

Typically, we found that texture and flavor were better when dishes were prepared in a more traditional manner.  We’ve also used the Instant Pot as a slow cooker using the optional glass lid. Again, it did a decent job but I wouldn’t say it matches the performance of a true slow cooker.UPDATE: After six months with our Instant Pot, we gave it up and passed it on to a family member.

But I read a lot of good things about the instant pot so I decided to take the plunge and buy one.I originally bought the 6 qt size and it was too heavy for me to lift in and out of a cabinet frequently. It might have been ok if it was going to stay on a counter and always be out. This smaller size is easier to move around, and since I'm not feeding a family, it's fine for me. I might get the bigger one if I had the counter space so I could make larger batches of food at once, but for now this one's fine.So far it's worked well.It doesn't always save time.For starters, there's a sear function. I guess some people like the idea of searing and then cooking in the same pot. I think it's faster and easier to sear something in a pan on the stove and then put it in.As a matter of fact, anything that can cook in an hour or less on the stove, will probably be easier and faster on the stove. Because keep in mind, the instant pot takes about 15 to 20 minutes to heat up, then there's the actual cooking time (usually 15 minutes to an hour for most recipes), then depending on what you're cooking, you can do a quick release of pressure, or let the instant pot cool down on its own.When I tried to do a quick release (as one recipe told me to do!) it didn't just release steam, but a geyser of liquid and grease all over my kitchen! So now I let it cool down on its own - which takes another 20 to 30 minutes. So anything I make in the instant pot will take me at least an hour start to finish. Maybe more. And it's more pieces to clean up than one pot on the stove. However, something cooking in an instant pot doesn't have to be watched as carefully for that hour its in use. I can walk away and do other things that I might not be able to do while cooking on a stove for an hour.But in general, for something that would normally take more than an hour on the stove or oven, this can work well. For me, if I can cook it on the stove or oven, start to finish, in an hour or so, I'll usually chose the stove or oven. The instant pot cook time might be 15 minutes, but with the warm up and cool down, it can take an hour there too.Safety issues I have are with the steam release valve. The open and closed position are not clearly marked. They're marked, but in small raised black lettering on a black background that's hard to see. So what's the logical thing to do? Lean in to read it! But you do NOT want to lean in or have any part of your body near the steam valve! I wish that was marked in a way that was easier to see.Another issue with the steam release valve is the same as it would be for any pressure cooker. If you're not used to pressure cooking, it's easy to grab it from the top which will result in major burns if you open it that way! This isn't a problem that's limited to instant pots, but it's a safety feature I wish someone would address with pressure cookers in general. Maybe invent a steam release valve that is not easy to grip from the top, or impossible to grip from the top. Something that can only be opened using a side lever.I worry about older people or distracted people using these or any pressure cookers. If you have children around, make sure they can't get near this. - Much like any item that gets hot during cooking and can burn. There are safety features to keep the pot from being opened if the steam has not been released (quickly or naturally after it cools down on its own) but the quick release steam valve can be really dangerous if it's moved to the open position by a child, a distracted person, or a curious pet who might lean in for a sniff!Another thing to know is that the silicone seal will absorb food odors - as all silicone does. I don't really mind much. I've read that some people buy extra silicone rings and use one for savory cooking and one for sweet so the odor doesn't affect their cooking flavors. I'm not sure that's needed, but extra silicone rings are inexpensive on amazon. (about $5 I think?)Other than the things mentioned above, I'm happy with the instant pot! It works well, cooks well, you can set the pressure and time manually or use a pre-set setting, and it even has a slow cooker setting if I decide to go back to slow cooking instead of pressure cooking.I don't use mine regularly like people who are nuts about these. I use mine once in a while. Maybe about 10 times so far. Overall, it works very well and I'm happy I bought it. I'm especially happy with this size. It's more manageable to lift and move around if you'll be keeping it in a cabinet and not out all the time.",3 Qt is a good size for 1 or 2 people,Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,13 people found this helpful,,,6784454,

Why would you bake a pie or a cake in this thing when a regular oven works just fine?  You can't possibly save any time.  I expect that it will be great for cooking lots of things, but the learning curve is steep.  There are blogs available that are helpful.One thing that I give it low marks for is that it is much larger than it appears in pictures.  I thought I would be able to leave it out on the counter, but it takes up far too much room.  Luckily, I was able to rearrange one cupboard so I can put it away.",Why would you bake a pie or a cake in this thing when a regular oven works just fine?

But I'm deducting a star for two reasons, and I hope the manufacturer will take note. The major reason is that the metal edges around the inside of the lid, especially where they stick out (see photo), were not properly buffed out and had some very sharp edges. I got two small cuts on my fingers from them. Nothing serious, but this should NEVER happen in a product like this. It's a problem on the line. Second, the silicon gasket that seals the lid has a very strong, chemical smell out of the box. We have many silicon appliances, and I've never noticed anything like that. Washing in hot water and the ""trial run"" they suggest took care of it. But it makes a very bad first impression when you think that something with such a nasty smell is going to be intimately connected to a hot, high pressure cooking process. I emphasize that we are very happy with the purchase and with what we have prepared so far. This would be a 5-star review if not for the points I have raised.","Good Product, But WARNING!",Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,23 people found this helpful,,,78693626,

I LOVE that the lid and stainless steel inner pot can be put in the dishwasher. I like that the cord detaches from the unit because I can put everything inside to keep it all together. It also came with two relatively small plastic utensils. (I think one of them is actually supposed to be a trivet, but I'm not very experienced with these gadgets. Looks like another spoon to me.) This gets stored on the countertop because I use it too often to bother putting it in a cabinet. It's has a footprint of about 1 Sq ft. HOWEVER, I have to say that the first one I received had a DOA sensor and it took a couple of weeks to get a replacement from the manufacturer in Canada. In hindsight, I should have just exchanged it with Amazon instead of calling them. On the other hand, though, they didn't want the broken one back, so now I have an extra inner pot and lid. I suppose that was worth the wait. I don't have one yet myself, but I suggest the silicone lid accessory if you sometimes go straight to the fridge like I do. It probably works better than foil or plastic.I am NOT a seller or advertiser or paid/compensated in ANY way for my review. NOBODY asked me to write this.

Another advantage of the InstantPot over the crock pot is that it doesn’t require as much planning in advance.I would recommend getting multiple seals because the seal gets stinky fast if you cook chicken with skin on.

Instant put is stainless steel on the inside .. not non stick. you don't have to worry about cooking your food in chemicals or worry about the nonstick coating wearing down and into your food.I would recommend getting the 6qt unless you have a huge family i could see the 8qt however the 8 qt is quite big and may be bigger than most would care for. We are a family of 3 and the 6qt is way more than enough for us or even for a family of 5!If you feel scared, overwhelmed, intimidated... that is NORMAL. There is so much information it is complete information overload. You may even feel like ""what the heck did i get myself into ?"" when going through the directions.  Breath- take it slow- youtube some videos if needed or if you have Facebook look for the instant pot Facebook page- you will find many nice and helpful people there to help you!Some tips on getting started..Be sure to start out with doing the water test.. it will test to make sure your pot is functioning correctly, it will steam clean the inside for you before your first venture and it will even help ease the nerves a bit too.Start with something easy... like hardboiled eggs! I have done 3 batches of hardboiled eggs in the past 5 days! They are so incredibly easy,  taste SO good and they are SO easy to peel! I do the 5-5-5 method. 5 minutes on high pressure cook, 5 minutes natural release (leave it alone for 5 minutes it will count up to L 5  manually release the rest at that point ) and put into an ice bath for 5 minutes. PERFECTLY hardboiled eggs!2nd I made something easy but more difficult... Homemade Mac and Cheese  IN TEN MINUTES! it only took 10 minutes to make homemade mac and cheese! The family loved if.. i don't think i can go back to Kraft...3rd.. I wanted to try meat and a bit more of a challenge... I made this most amazing meatloaf ever.I still get nervous and feel overwhelmed and second guess myself. I can't wait to be so comfortable with it i am willing to experiment and do my own thing... I am not there yet but the learning curve is worth it. This is life changing!For cleaning, you will need to clean the different pieces which can be a pain but its the sanitary thing to do, don't be lazy :) The Stainless steel insert is dishwasher safe.. if you find you are having a hard time with burnt on food a good soak in hot water and soap and it comes off easy.. for anything REALLY burnt on you can scrub with bar keepers friend. The cover you will want to wash by hand. I was the silicone ring by hand too.. not sure if you have to but i do.... don't forget to wash the plastic drip collector thing.. if you forget about cleaning that.. it may be growing your own science project.... gross.",This is not your grandmothers pressure cooker!,Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,25 people found this helpful,,,930261,

Once it's unable to seal, you sit around and wait for it to heat up, which can take 15-20 minutes, only to realize it was all for nothing as it cannot seal and cannot pressure cook.

The one that she wouldn't even allow me into the kitchen when she was using it. And that picture floating around Facebook of the pressure cooker lid embedded in someone's ceiling didn't help! But I read a lot of reviews and webpages and finally broke down and decided to try one.I bought a PPCXL from Costco and jumped in with both feet. I made several delicious meals using recipes from the web and I canned peppers, jam, and applesauce using recipes from the included book. Then I found out that electric pressure cookers are not safe to can with even though the PPCXL company said it was and included a recipe book for home canning. I ended up having to throw away everything I had already canned and that just annoyed me to the point that I didn't want a product from that company in my home so I returned it and ordered the Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1. I chose this one because a) the company specifically says this product is not safe for pressure canning, it has a stainless steel pot instead of non-stick, and it has the yogurt function.We’re trying to eliminate all non-stick cookware from our kitchen so going to the stainless pot here was a step in the right direction. I really didn’t think I would use the yogurt function much. I don’t dislike yogurt but it’s not something I ever wanted all the time either so I thought I’d try it once and then go back to buying the occasional container at the grocery store. I couldn’t have been more wrong! Even if I wasn’t cooking tons of other fabulous recipes in my IP, the yogurt feature alone has made the IP my one “can’t live without” kitchen appliance (I even took it RV camping with us!). The yogurt is crazy simple to make and so much healthier than the preservative and sweetener loaded stuff at the store. Milk and a starter (a tbsp. or two of yogurt) are all you need and the IP does all the work while you sleep!I could go on and on about the yogurt, but then I wouldn’t have time to write about all of the other things you can make. Dishes like Pineapple Pepper Chicken (less than 1 hour including ALL prep and cook time!), Jambalaya (also less than an hour!), and absolutely melt in your mouth fall off the bone ribs. Yes, RIBS! In less than an hour! Want to make some desserts? How about cheesecake or dulce le’ leche? Homemade hummus in less than an hour? Not a problem! Bread? It can do that too!This really is the most versatile appliance I own. And on those hot summer days when you don’t want to heat up the kitchen it’s a lifesaver! No more hot oven heating up the house for hours, just grab the IP!If you’re still reading, what are you waiting for? Order yourself this miracle gadget now!All of the attached photos are of food I've made in my Instant Pot. Pineapple Pepper Chicken, Crustless Quiche, Sausage & Spinach Scrambler, Beef Chili, Roasted Garlic Hummus, Sausage & Kraut, Boiled Peanuts, Yogurt, Jambalaya",If there was a 10 star option I'd choose it!,Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,107 people found this helpful,1290,425,489543,Public

The problem I found with the crockpot was that a lot of things end up tasting the same no matter what you do. That is not the case with this!!! Not only can you use it as a crockpot and maintain the integrity of the ingredients you put in somehow, you can do so much more. I have made my own Greek yogurt, you can saute ingredients first (only ONE pot messy!!), and cook things in the most delicious way in record time.

And they are great for that, but they are SO, so good for vegetarian meal prep as well. I had purchased a bunch of Rancho Gordo heirloom beans, but they had been sitting in my pantry for 6 months. I never think to pre-soak beans the day before I want to cook them. I'm not good with planning ahead, I guess. With the instant pot, I can throw un-soaked, dry beans into the pot and they're ready in less than an hour. It also helps me cook rice in minutes without resorting to using boxed, sodium-laden instant rice. Lentils are also a breeze.I even use them when I'm just feeling super lazy. It only takes 10 minutes to boil pasta or steam veggies on the stovetop, but when I don't feel like waiting for water to boil or I don't want to clean a pasta pot and a sauce pot, I dump even these quick-cooking things in my Instant Pot mini and I literally have dinner on the table in 5 minutes. 10 minutes if I add sliced mushrooms and greens to my pasta. So easy. I got mine on a great deal - I think it was a returned or refurbished model, but it works great, and as a single person I'm glad I got the mini. Haven't missed the size of the larger pot at all, but it can take some trial and error to adjust recipes down to this size.

Anything to help prepare them faster and with more consistent results. I opted for the 3 quart model since I usually make only two servings at a time. Unfortunately, after reading the included manual and recipe book, both brown rice and steel cut oats are best cooked on the ""Multigrain"" mode, which isn't in the 3 quart model!I called Instant Pot and they recommended using ""Pressure Cook"" instead. Supposedly the only difference in the ""Multigrain"" mode is a ""warm pre-soak"" before the main cycle. I've made a few batches of both long grain brown rice and steel cut oats and they seem to come out fine. But it's hard to say if they'd be even better with the proper multigrain setting. 🤷‍♂️Be great if it was clear that this mode is not in the 3 quart version BEFORE you purchase it.

For most meals I brown the meat in the pot on the sauce setting, then throw in everything else and turn it on.  It's incredible how fast everything cooks and the flavors blend beautifully in just a few minutes.  This will greatly expand our repertoire of meals in the RV, but right now I'm already using it a couple of times a week at home.

When I thought about pressure cookers, I thought of my grandmother standing over a stove, canning vegetables from the garden. Boy, was I wrong! This is hands down my new favorite kitchen appliance, and it has saved me so much time in the kitchen. Let me tell you: The Instant Pot is a total game changer for time-starved cooks, working moms, and anyone who doesn't have time to stand over a stove waiting for a pot to boil.In the month or so that I've been using it, I've made a huge batch of 1-minute quinoa, steel cut oats, homemade refried beans, shredded salsa chicken, hardboiled eggs (for snacking & egg salad), tender thin-sliced steak and brown gravy, and even gluten-free pasta with meat sauce (all in one pot!)It's not always that the IP takes less time (because there is some time involved in coming up to pressure and releasing the pressure), but it's that you can walk away while the magic happens. It automatically kicks over to a warming function after cook time ends, so if you get busy doing something, your food will stay nice and warm!  (I actually picked up a rotisserie chicken from our local supermarket one afternoon, and came home and put it in the Instant Pot on the KEEP WARM function until dinner time. How awesome is that?)It's been really useful for meal prep, too! I am a big fan of cook once, eat twice type meals, and the IP is nice because a big batch of beans, quinoa, brown rice, soup, etc. doesn't necessarily take any extra time to cook. I was able to freeze single servings of quinoa, rice, beans, etc. to use on nights when I don't have time to cook.There IS a learning curve when it comes to figuring out cooking times, converting recipes, etc., so I recommend joining the Instant Pot group on Facebook, following some food bloggers who share IP recipes, and downloading all the Kindle Unlimited books that you can get as you learn how to use it. Start with something simple, and you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly.I've also heard a lot of people complain in FB groups about the silicone rings smelling like whatever you last cooked in the Instant Pot, so some people suggest having two rings: one for sweet and one for savory foods. It certainly doesn't affect the flavor of your food (at least, not in my experience) but if that bothers you, you might want to snag an extra silicone ring when you buy your IP.Overall, I am BEYOND pleased with my purchase and I am happy to share that dinnertime is a little easier at my house thanks to the IP!","ABSOLUTE gamechanger for time-starved cooks, busy moms and weekly meal prep!",Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,23 people found this helpful,165,12,1766184,Public

I saw the Bluetooth Instant pot, and I like technology, but...who's gonna put the food in it? lolI hate to cook. Been doing Blue Apron for a few months and I loved Blue Apron. I decided it was time to cook on my own, and boy is this the best appliance I have ever purchased. I have cooked more using the Instant Pot than I ever have. Seriously, I can't believe the flavor of the food. The first thing I made was chicken thighs with carrots, celery, and onions. In 20 minutes, I had a meal that was so tasty even my daughter was impressed (knowing how I cook). The chicken was tender, the carrots were soft not mushy, and the flavor was incredible. When I would use a crock pot, everything I made was mushy and it all tasted the same.The food I made in the Instant Pot was so good, that 3 of my friends bought it too, one bought the 8 quart. The stainless steel pot, along with parts being available thru Amazon is why I chose this one. There are great websites dedicated to Instant Pot, that makes finding recipes a breeze. The best thing I have figured out is this.... Find a recipe you like and use the ingredients you like, just follow approx cook time. Easy really. The user manual kinda overwhelmed me, until I realized it was in several languages..lol After you read it, go to page 17 and do the water test. (I saved the water for my house plants) Then get cooking.Clean up...I have Farberware stainless steel I received as a wedding gift (lots) of years ago and when I burned things, was a pain to clean. But I knew I did not want a Teflon pot insert. You can saute' right in the stainless steel pot, and then close it up to pressure cooks. Surprised to say, this is easy to clean, especially after I learned to ""deglaze"" it...Don't laugh...  :)Occasionally I put in dishwasher just to disinfect. I found that I am using the manual mode way more than any programmed buttons.I can't recommend it enough, from someone who really hates cooking. This is the start of my new years resolution to get healthy. According to Dr Mercola, steaming food is very healthy.  You will not be disappointed!Oh my...When I saw I could add pictures I was so excited.... Leg of lamb, Brussels sprout in 10 minutes and didn't stink up the house, fresh beets...17 minutes! Pork and Sauerkraut, I could go on. I really hope this helps anyone thinking about this pressure cooker. LOVE IT!I'm buying an air fryer next....for the crispy things...healthy crispy things..

Although it is large for a meal for 2, I like the extra space when making homemade chicken & veg broth, soup, and pot roast. It's very easy to clean (I handwash) but it does absorb food odors which are hard to remove. My only complaint is that the steam release valve does not open as much as I'd like when quick releasing, which makes it not very quick. I have to manually hold the steam release open all the way so it can release in 2-3 min as opposed to 10. I brought this to to Instant Pot customer service and they said it's normal for the larger pots which i don't agree with. Do not buy this if you think it will help you make quick dinners...depending on the amount of food and liquid you have in there it can take up to 15-20 minutes to come to pressure + cook time + steam release time (again, if you have a lot of liquid and do a natural release this can take up to 30-45 minutes). But if you have some time it does a great job of infusing flavor in a relatively shorter amount of time.When making broth, I like that I can throw a chicken carcass, herbs, and veggie scraps in there and after 45minutes+natural release the chicken carcass is pretty much disintegrated and the herbs have all dissolved off of the stems and gives the broth great flavor.",Great for Broth and Soup,Size: 8-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,487,138,10745,Public

It seems to be the right size for the two of us. I find that it does a superb job making beans and grains as well as soups; I make steel cut oats for breakfast, a new batch every few days. I like that convenience. I also made a yummy farro risotto with Italian sausage, black bean soup and a salmon recipe (Melissa) that gave me a ‘burn notice’ (the fish came out great, but the sauce burned.The caveat: don't expect this machine to be the be all, end all of cooking appliances. Preparing full meals? Most Instant Pot recipes instruct you to select 'Sauté', and brown things (onions, garlic et al) in the steel pot, then proceed with adding the remaining ingredients; then you allow the pot to come to pressure (about 15 min), it cooks for however much time the recipe calls for (5 min-30 min), allow for release (either let sit 10 min and release remaining pressure, or wait for the pressure to come down, up to ½ hour). All those things considered, it’s often easier to prepare entrées using stovetop or oven. Not much time is saved by using pressure. Another thing, the many Instant Pot cookbooks I’ve perused don’t have a lot of recipes I would care to prepare.To conclude: this is an excellent product; it's easy to use and gives good results.

Upon arrival I tried the water test and it passed the test. Next thing we tried was steaming rice - followed all instructions and came out OK, but our old rice cooker at home does the job better, since this rice came out quite mushy .Next use, decided to go all in and cook my first complete meal - Hungarian Goulasch (using the slow-cooker program). Prepped all ingredients and started the slow-cooker program on Low for 6-8 hours. Went on a hike all day in belief my food was being cooked, only to realize 8 hours later that the stew-meat was hard as a shoe-sole and the potatoes still raw. Couldn't wrap myself around it until I realized that the ""keep warm"" function lights on by default when selecting a program. My interpretation of this light being on while selecting a program was that the IP would keep the food warm upon completion of a program run. But that's not the case - actually - the light being on OVERRIDES the program to run. Merely, my ingredients had only been kept warm for 8 hours instead of slowly cooked. Very frustrating, no dinner that evening but decided to start over with the same batch and ensure the keep-warm button was OFF (only showing slow-cooker lit up, not both). Selected ""normal"" instead of ""low"" as I didn't feel it needed to cook as long worrying my food would build up bacteria.After 5 hours the stew meat and potatoes not cooked through, so increased to ""high"" for 2 more hours. No change. At this point, my food had stayed on medium temperature for too many hours that the risk of bacteria build up was too high and I didn't want to risk my family getting food poisoning. So I had to throw away the whole batch of goulash that my family was planned to enjoy at the end of a day of hiking.Stubborn as I am, I decided to start over the next day and cook a whole new batch on the slow-cooker program on ""high"" for 6 hours, with new meat and ingredients. It came out better than the day before, but by no means close to the tenderness of the beef-stew after slow-cooking it as my old slow-cooker at home.Have yet to try the pressure cooking programs, but must admit, at this point I have lost confidence in the product and am considering returning it. I'm worried about how many more batches of food it will ruin for me before I give up on it. Maybe it's not as versatile as marketed, it's probably just good at one thing - pressure cooking and that's it? Too early to say, will update this review once tried that option as well.For the purchase price, I wouldn't say it's worth it.","Lost trust - slow cooker program is crap - ruined my food, will keep my old slow-cooker at home.",Size: 6-QTStyle: Duo NovaPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,6,8,10703573,Public

I still alive. And the Instant Pot bee pretty good and safe.PART ONEIn the beginin I not so sure. And this all be hauntin are family fur many yeers.Back in 1952 Grandma Wilkes buy something called the Immediate Pot that cost $4.99 on sale that promise to change her life. She kook from dawn to dusk fur a big family of 8 useless boys, 1 girl named Lulu and a husband named Zelmo who want hisdinner on the tabul when he say so. And while Grandma Wilkes and her sistur, Bready come from a line of good kooks, they also seem to inhabut the stoopid side of the family.On July 29 exactly 67 years ago, Zelmo and his brothers Elmo and Velmo, shoot a 14 pound posum and bring it home and want to eat it.   IMMEDIATELY !!!   For breakfast !!   Why for breakfust, yew say?  Well everbody with a brain the size of a walnut, no that yew kill posums at nite with Dawgs an men wearin there long underware.  Anyway, Zelmo, Elmo and Velmo bee so proud of thereselves for shootin the bigust posum in the county that they invite everbody home who they pass in town. Everbody want to see that big sucker 14 pound possum lookin up at them from a pool of gravy !!  Well Grandma Wilkes and her sister Bready haf to get up first thing before daylite and start to kook this 14 pound record settin behemoth immediately for everbody in town, plus those 8 useless boys. And so she drag out the presure kooker. (And she obbiously be under tremendous presure herself, to get this deelishus posum breakfast on the tabul.) So while Grandma Wilkes and Bready hurredly be preparin all the fixins for the big posum breakfast, Lulu get the job of aktually packin this ""verman"" (who also happen to be the name of my Oncle [Verman] on my daddys side) in the Immediate Pot. From the begining it seem to bee a problem. ""WHERE BEE ARE DEELISHUS POSUM BREAKFAST???"" cry Zelmo.“IT WON'T FIT MAMA !!  SCREAM LULU.  IT WON'T FIT !!   IT BE HOMOGENEOUS”“STUFF IT IN THERE, LULU !!  STUFF IT IN THERE !  CRY GRANDMA WILKES.   BREADY GRAB THE BROOM HANDLE !Well they finully get this monstrausagus in the pot an tighten it down with a crowbar.Well you no where this story bee going. And as everbody no, hoo look back on the sitiation, ther ain't no surprises hear.  Because there bee a splosion that was hurd all the way to the state line. Most everbody seem to be OK (altho most everbody also had a tendency to say Huh?? for the rest of their lives.)  Well except Grandma Wilkes who unfortunately hav her head blown to Chattanooga.So needles to say that $4.99 Immediate Pot did seem to change Grandma Wilkes life.(And fur the record, those 8 useless boys say the posum taste pretty good.)PART TOOIt took more than convincing fur me to by a pressure kooker. My mama, “Little Bready” (who not bee named fur relations on the other side of the family but after “Big Bready” who once bee an adult film star) tell me  “Yew need to relax moor, dotter, now that yur older.""  But to relax moor, yew got to tecknologocify.Now my mama worry about me and that bee OK.  When she marry my daddy, Boo, thay hav a pretty hard life together and she hafto slow down two when she develop calluses on her eyelids that neerly turn her blind.I say Mama, I not bee afrayed to teknologicify. Yew no I alreddy be as quick as I can be. An you no that I can kook everthing that swim, crawl, buzz, fly or scratch.I no dotter, say my mama, Little Bready.  When it come to food, you be a real kook.  But all I sayin is that you needtobee more aficient.But Mama, how  can I bee moor aficient if I don't got no head?At furst she conceit that I got a good point but in the end she persistify and persistify. I finully relegated and say OK. OK Mama, I in yur hands with this presure kooker  And I in the hands of the Lord.So my mama Little Bready and my ant by me an Instant Pot with all the possible ecksesorieslike spatoolas, wire trivials an screen door strainin gadgets.  But that Instant Pot sit in the box formonths and months.  And months.Finully my ant come to see me one morning and say,  Enuf bee enuf !!   Yew gonna get yurself out of this bed an kook us a meel with this concraption.  Yur mama and I spent are hard erned  money so you can be a womun of leeseure.  So get out of this bed rite now  !!Well I cant argue with that, I say to myself.   My ant probly bee the most sensicable womun I no.  (She neerly graduate from Jr high school.)So I pull my clothes on and then I rembemember that Uncle Will, Ant Chartroose and there groan son, Cuzin Gill (who live a life of intestinal affliction) bee coming for supper.  OK, I say to myself, that not going to bee a big ďeel.  I kook for them lots of times.So I plan my menu--pigs nuckles, collerd greens, grasshopper gizzards and a big sweet potato pie for dessert. And with lots of time, I stop over to the Piggy Wiggly to get a few things.  (But in the bag of my mind I cant stop  aworryin about that Instant Pot and weather it gonna blow us to kingdom come.)It be suppertime now, my gests arrive, I make small talk about my other ant, Ant Violet her little dotter LadyMary an there battle with that there toenail fungus that be sweeping all of Englund.  An then we talk quite a bit about Cuzin Gills sorry triboolations with his intestines.  An so by now everbody no that I bee stalling for time. So my mama an my ant fiscally drag me by the hare, out to the kitchen, to kook them pig nuckles.  An with them watchin ovur my shoulder, I put one of those babies in the pot an set it fur 23 minutes.  Well that aktually wernt two bad. But then it start to beep and gurgle.  And then it began to hissin an spittin an start to carrion like nobodys biznis.  It sound like when Cuzin Gill come back from Mexicali !!I get down on my hands and nees an scream,  O Heaven !!!  I headed for Chattanooga !! I wait a minute an nothin happun.  I open my eyes an wonder weather the next face I wood lay  eyes on wood be Grandma Wilkes.  But no, it bee my own mama, Little Bready.She say, Get up dotter,  get up!!  It soposed to make that racket.  Now get up, the bell dun ring an let's eat them nuckles.My mamas voice always sound so reesonable and kind.  So I bee reassured and open up that pot an there be a aroma of suckulence that few can conscribe.  All 3 of us be tickled pink!!  (Just like them pigs nuckles.)But as we carrion out the door this big platter of nuckles, we abruptly hurd it.  This big huge  Displosion---- BAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNGGGGG !!!!!!  And fire that belch cleer across the room.  The windows break, the door come off its hinges and I land on my flying buttress !! Those nuckles fly off of that platter an role around that flore.  (But I not so woried, th flore bee kleen--see my vacyoom revuew.)BUT WHAT HAPPUN ???  We look back.  No it wernt the Instant Pot.  And it not bee an act of God.    Neer as we can tell, Cuzin Gill had ben eatin on a green appul and in a fit of intestinal rambunkshishness manage to ignite the pilot lite on the water heater.  An when we pick ourselves up oft the ground, we calm down pretty  good.  But it take Jack Daniels.So as I reflect on this hear day.  The Instant Pot dinner bee a complete success.  Everbodys heads still bee attached.  TIme wil tel how long we bee sayin Huh??

The rice was perfectly cooked, the chicken was juicy and tender and the vegetables were cooked but not mushy.  Think about the steps, pots, and effort involved in typically preparing this meal.  Soaking the rice, cooking it separate from everything else.  Cooking the vegetables and chicken separately.  Again, all I did but throw everything in the pot and set the timer for 26 minutes.  One pot to clean afterwards!The other items came out out just as well.  The cooking time time is better than conventional cooking but not as much as you'd think because of the time it takes the pot to pressurize.As with most wildly popular products, this one is certainly slightly over hyped.

If I had to guess, the temp sensors in the pot allow it to only give the unit the exact amount of thermal energy it needs for the pressure, so it doesn't go spitting out steam. Either way, pressure cooking without hearing hissing behind me or worrying about steam damaging the cabinets the whole time will be huge in my house. I also tested the saute function a little bit.

Still, I somehow avoided getting Instant Pot until recently.Maybe it was the peer pressure, or maybe it was just idle curiosity that finally kicked me over the edge. I have a traditional pressure cooker collecting dust in the basement, and truth be told, I've always been a little afraid of it. I have memories of mom cooking up dinner (circa 1965) in this hissing nightmare of a device. But still, I'd heard the Instant Pot was different.It is different. For one thing, it doesn't go on top of the stove. It plugs in, and it self-monitors to maintain a constant pressure, so it doesn't have to release excess steam -- no hissing while it cooks.The directions are well-written, and the unit is very well-built. If the recipe calls for it, you can brown meat in the stainless-steel insert, although I think this would be slower that just browning whatever meat you're using on the stove in a regular frypan. Clean-up is a bit fussy, since there is a silicone seal to remove and wash. The stainless steel cooking insert comes right out and can be hand washed or put in your dishwasher.The idea of reducing my cook times is appealing, but all is not as it first seems. The unit takes a bit of time to reach a boil (and then to build up steam pressure), and takes a bit more time to depressurize. It is all very elegant and non-scary. I conclude that it is worth the effort to use it if you want to cook meat or fowl quickly. Still, remember that this is a fancy steamer: it doesn't produce nice crunchy skin on chicken or beef.Also, if you are making a meat dish that includes vegetables, you'll need to cook in two stages. If you dump the meat in with the vegetables all at once, the vegetables will cook down to mush by the time the meat is done. So, that means to get everything right, you need to allow separate time to pressurize/depressurize for the meat stage, and then pressurize/depressurize again for the vegetables stage. And, all of this is hands-on (as opposed to a slow-cooker, which is pretty much hands-off).I made hard-boiled eggs that were quite good. But all-in-all, it was no faster than just boiling them on the stove.So, I'm thankful to the inventor of Instant Pot for getting me over my pressure-cooker paranoia. And I do use the devise when I need to cook/tenderize meat in a hurry. I'll use it, for sure, but not often enough to make room for it upstairs in my already over-crowded kitchen. It is in my basement, in the space created when I tossed out the old-fashioned pressure cooker that I never ever used.",Pressure Cooker:  V. 2.0,Size: 8-QTStyle: Duo PlusPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,193,76,68059,Public

It was way too big for two people and I could not take it with me in our RV.  I then bought this 3 quart.  I have used it four times for different things, bone in pork chops, brown and wild rice pilaf, pot roast, and boneless chicken breast with mushroom gravy.  All of these things turned out well although I am learning to tweak things as I go along.  Most recipes online are for the 6 qt. but you just cut the base liquid in half and the food in half for the 3 quart.  For example, if cooking a chicken on the trivet you would need 1/2 c liquid for the mini and a cup for the 6 quart.  You can still put in cups of liquid in the smaller one for other kinds of recipes, but you always need some liquid.  I don't believe it is quite as fast as you would think because there is the time to bring up to pressure and the various times letting the pressure release depending upon the recipe, but it works well and I always have enough leftovers for two people if I want. Also, with these cookers it doesn't matter if you are cooking 1 pork chop or 4 they still take the same time to cook so you don't have to keep guessing so much on what to do.  Clean up is easy.  I thought the sealing ring would be a drag to get in and out but it's not and the stainless steel cooking container is very easy to clean.  I will be using this in our RV as I don't have an oven and on previous trips I couldn't really cook too much and you don't want to be grilling all the time outside.  The sauté function works quite well, too.  I think one or two busy people would really enjoy having one of these. I have used a slow cooker in the past, but I feel tied down to them and actually don't find them as easy to use as cooking times can seem to vary so much.  Plus you don't sautés in them.  This is not the fad gadget I thought it would be, use a few times, grow tired of it and put it in a cupboard like my juicer and blender.

Many people would now add beans, but I don't like beans. I use macaroni instead, and it doesn't freeze well, so I boil a quarter cup (dry) of macaroni when I have chili. I also boiled some ham bones, removed the bones and skimmed the brother, added peas, shaved carrots and spices. I pressure cooked that since it was for dinner. It took 15 minutes to render the peas into a sauce. I served it with steak knives since the chunks of ham are rather large. I pressure cooked some chicken breasts for 17 minutes since they started out frozen, and when they were done, I added a can of mushroom soup, a can of cream of celery soup, and a cup of white rice. Two minutes of pressure cooking made divine chicken and rice. I could go on and on, but the point is, what used to take multiple pans now takes one Instant Pot. If you do not have one, hurry.

My husband bought me the 8quart for an early Christmas gift, and it's AMAZING! I suck at remembering to take things out to defrost, so it's perfect for me. So far I made (in one pot) pork chili verde burritos, chicken and rice casserole, bbq shredded chicken sandwiches, and lastnight, a frozen solid pot roast! No joke, frozen pot roast turned into falling apart delicious goodness with potatos and carrots in 90 mins! It seriously took 4 mins to cook the potatos and carrots. Frozen chicken from costco in 15 mins. Ive  had almost no dishes to do all week long. It's friggin awesome. Can't say enough good stuff about it. I have a family of 3, but i bought the 8 quart, because i make leftovers for my husbands lunch the next day. And im so glad i got the bigger one. It's huge very large (about the size of a new wave oven) but worth the extra space you get inside. I could see myself being dissapointed  if I would have gone with the 6quart. Because you can only fill it up 2/3 of the way. All in all great buy, I'm giving away my crockpot. Makes food 10x better and faster. Also one thing to mention, is cabinets... when you push back the vent switch, there is alot of steam. I knew there was steam before I bought it ( thanks to schooling myself on YouTube videos before it arrived in the mail) but I was not aware of how much steam, and that it shoots out steam for a while.

The design has changed. It is not the one in the picture on Amazon even though it is the Duo Plus.  Okay, I can live with that. This pot does not have the Pressure Cook button down in the bottom right hand corner and the lid design has changed.  This one has the Sous Vid feature. I have no idea why they thought it would be a great idea to move the Pressure Cooker button where it was so easy to find (next to the Cancel and Saute buttons across the bottom) and replace it with the Sous Vid button I will never use.  The one they sent me smelled like plastic burning so after running the Sterilize feature three times and having a horrible time getting the steam release to not release steam nor get the smell to improve, I exchanged it. The one I received today does not smell like plastic burning!  Off to a good start. However, I'm still having the same problem with their new and improved lid.  I can't just set it and walk away. I have to wait until it comes up to pressure and mess with the new lever button until the dang thing seals and quits shooting steam out the steam release button. Five times (between the two pots), I have run the Sterilize feature to figure out this new and improved pot and five times, I've had to mess with the lid to get the steam to quit shooting out the top.  I'm calling Customer Service tomorrow. Amazon says Instant Pot is open on the weekends, but that is not accurate so, don't waste your time calling.  I hope they can send me the version I bought this summer. If not, there is a good chance I will return this unit even though it's 50% off in price.

Nearly everything I've tried to cook in it takes hours longer than it should because once the Instant Pot gets up to cooking heat and pressure a ""burn"" signal displays on the screen. It doesn't seem to matter how much liquid there is in the pot.Example - Yesterday I made beef stew in my Instant Pot. The cooking time described in the recipe I was following suggested 25 minutes. It ended up taking three + hours because the ""burn"" signal kept appearing on the display. At one point I emptied the contents in the inner pot to another container to see if the food was actually burning. Guess what, it wasn't. There was no burnt food on the interior. So I cleaned out the inner pot, let everything cool down for a while then returned the stew to the pot to give it another go and then ... no improvement. The ""burn"" signal appeared once again.I called Instant Pot's customer service and spoke to a gentleman who was very polite but utterly unhelpful in regards to this issue.There is nothing in the owner's manual about the ""burn"" signal. When I searched online the only advice I found was from other consumers who had the same problem and were left to come up with their own solutions.I would recommend that if you like slow cooked or pressure cooked food that you stay away from this product. It does not work as advertised, the owner's manual is a joke of a manual, containing little information about the pot and no information about the ""burn"" signal whatsoever.The food I've cooked int the instant pot has all been delicious however as I mentioned earlier it takes hours and a lot of maintenance to cook nearly anything.","""burn"" arrrg",Size: 8-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,9 people found this helpful,9,4,5741584,Public

So for me so far, I am not impressed as much as people I have talked to about this appliance have said I would.  I do feel that it is useful, and so far it works great.  It is just not as awesome as you read about.  I made a chili that the prep time said was 10 minutes and the cook time was 20 mins.  In reality, it took about an hour and a half from start to finish.  And it could have just been made in a conventional pot just as easily.  So just be aware that if a recipe states that it cooks in 5 mins that is after the 8-10 mins for it to get up to pressure.

It's the best investment I've made in a long time! There is a pretty steep learning curve if your someone who doesn't like to cook. I love to cook and learn new things so it worked out for me. But you have to do things differently with the instant pot. However, once you get a few recipes down it's so easy to use! I use mine almost every day!Note about the ""Instant"" part of the Instant Pot. It's not really as ""instant"" as some might think. Most Instant Pot recipe cook times are not accounting for prep, pressurization, and cool down or de-pressurization. Something that takes 20mins to cook in the Instant Pot really takes like 30-45mins because it has to get up to pressure first before it starts the cook timer. Then you either do a quick release or a natural release of the pressure which can add anywhere from 5-40mins depending on what your cooking. So this means some things take just as long to cook as if they were on the stove top or in the oven. However, there are things that cook a lot faster than they would normal regardless of the extra time. For example, baked (or rather steamed) potatoes only take about 20 mins including pressurization, cook time, and quick release in the instant pot instead of an hour in the oven. Plus it doesn't heat up the whole house like an oven and for me, who lives in Arizona, not heating up my house any more than I have to in the Summer is a blessing. :D So for that reason alone, it's super worth it!I recommend watching some how-to videos online and getting a feel for how to use the product before purchasing.",LOVE MY INSTANT POT,Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,245,202,68082,Public

I expressed concern that they have a test that will cause the unit to randomly power down mid-cycle but I would not be spending hours of my life videoing the appliance to catch it shutting off at a random time. They responded that a video isn't necessary and they'll send me a new cooking unit but they are currently out of stock and they'll contact me when they have them in stock again.

So while it cooks your meat in a quarter of the time, you can’t open the thing half way through to throw in carrots and potatoes. Say you are doing a large roast -your carrots and potatoes will likely come out much mushier than you would like. Same thing for stews, curries etc. Not that you can’t make those in the instant pot, but you might end up cooking the veggies separately. Also, this will not replace your rice cooker. I’ve tried it with the instructions, but it doesn’t cook the rice faster or better.. a $20 rice cooker with on on/off switch seems to figure that out better. That said there is a wealth of instant pot recipes and info online now, I recommend looking at those to get an idea of how you would use the instant pot to cook at home. Cleaning is pretty simple but food particles stick to the pot a little more than I expected. I always have to let it soak for a while. Also, if you don’t remove the clear rubber seal and clean it separately the smells of what you cooked will linger on. In conclusion I think that yes, it’s worth it to have something that takes your meat from frozen to fall off the bone tender in under an hour.  I’m looking forward to discovering new ways to use my Instant Pot.","If you have it, use it!

Over and over we did everything they asked and more. Now, over 3 months and many hours of time later they have agreed to send us a new sealing ring only.

I kept flipping through it looking for seemingly basic information, only to come up empty. After reaching out to friends and family I found that this is a fairly common complaint. I almost deducted more stars because honestly, what good is a product if I can't use it without doing my own research?An example of how useless the manual is:On my first cook my instantpot beeped at me and displayed *BURN* I reached for the manual to see what I should do to remedy the situation, it told me my food was probably burning (never world have guessed the message meant that!) and I needed to clean the pot. I went through the process of cooling the pot down, dumped out my half cooked food and scrubbed the pot before dumping the food back in and restarting the cook. 5 minutes later I was told *BURN* again. After confirming that the manual had no further recommendations I told my pot it could go burn in Halifax and let the cook go on, sure that my food would be charred and I'd be returning the hunk of junk. My food came out fine. It was a little brown on the bottom, but still perfectly edible. I've later learned that to prevent this problem you just need to add some more fluid.)Now that I've consulted experienced instantpot owners and can use my own experience to go on I'm loving this thing. I had resisted buying one for so long partially because I didn't want another gadget taking up my limited kitchen space, I relented when my newly converted friend told me she was able to get rid of her slow cooker, rice cooker and steamer. I don't have a lot of time to cook, and the concept of thinking about making dinner at the same time as breakfast, in the slow cooker, has never caught on with me. So it's great that in the afternoon I can remember that pretty soon I'm expected to feed 4 other humans and toss fully frozen veggies, meat, and the uncooked rice or pasta in and have something tasty pop out in under an hour! Honestly it's an absent minded, busy mother's dream machine and even with the manual that might as well be one page that states ""I don't know man, you figure it out."" I still recommend it.

I bought a 10 qt for Thanksgiving for myself and one for my son for Christmas. I got him the 10qt because it was cheaper than the 8 qt.  But he complains he has no room in his kitchen. So then I bought him the 6qt and kept the 10qt for myself for Thanksgiving; and I’ll give my son a choice between it or cash.  Hopefully he'll take the cash instead, because I could use the smaller one for broccoli and smaller dishes.  Anyway, the 10qt is large. I get 1-2 more quarts of bone broth from it. The main problem I have with the 10qt is there are no accessories made for the 10qt!  There are the 8qt accessories, but those are small, and if you per chance buy the baskets that fit 6-8 qts, you are buying 6 qt baskets . Those are much smaller and leave too much wasted space. SOMEBODY!!  PLEASE MAKE 10 QT BASKETS!!! I can’t even find a 10qt insert replacement. So I’m glad I at least bought two pressure cookers. Someone complained about the weight of the pressure cooker not fitting the lid. Well, I’m not proud of admitting this, but I got angry and banged the heel of my hand down on the weight and now it fits. What did I do?  I don’t know, but it fits.  Maybe I should pull out the other 10qt lid and compare them. But it does work. There’s not much else to say that I didn’t say in the review of my 8 quart pot below. If you are trying to decide between the 8q and 10q, I would recommend the 8 quart...at least until they begin making accessories. If you’re going to cook most things in the basket, the largest basket is the 8q. This leave a lot of space in the 10q to pressurize, which also takes more time before the timer begins. It also takes up more space on the countertop. Frankly, if you’re making bone broth, it’s going to be thinner (not as gelatinous) if you add more water, which, if the basket is full, you’ll want the water to reach the top of the basket’s contents. You can’t add many more bones in the 10q than you would in the 8qt; and again, it will take up more time to pressurize with subpar results. I have to wonder if the 10q was a ditched idea or afterthought, since nobody YET has made accessories to go with it. But, hey! You do you! If you think you’ll do better with a 10q, you won’t hurt my feelings. Either way, the instant pot is one of the best decisions I’ve made in 2020, and I don’t regret buying the 10q. I cooked a ham in it, and it turned out pretty good.[end of update]8 qt review: This isn't Grandma's stovetop pressure cooker!!  My goodness!I first used it on chicken breast and broccoli.  Yep. I was talking to my sister on the phone about my new instant pot, hoping to glean tips from her, and I had the chicken cooking. Suddenly it began hissing and spitting and steaming. I literally jumped back and asked, ""Oh my gosh! What's happening?""  She said, ""I don't know!  What is happening?""  So I described the evil emitting from the top of the pot. She said, ""You didn't do the water test, did you?"" I did NOT do the water test.  I told her it smelled like plastic was burning, and she assured me that was normal, too.  It was all normal. It's all the magic of the instant pot!I also thought it was broke because the pressure release valve would not release pressure unless I pulled the lever and held on to the switch. I learned you have to PUSH the button DOWN for a continuous hands-free release!  You can pull the lever to the side to release a little or you can push DOWN on the top of it to allow it to release it all at once!  AND you can pull the lever while it is autoreleasing, and it will stop releasing.The cool thing about my particular model, besides having holes in the handles to set the lid, is it automatically sets it to pressure, so you don't have to push anything on the top of the lid before starting it. Also, the steam releases from a different spot than on the same lever you pull to release. I would definitely get scorched with the other models!So, I got the 8 quart, and I don't regret it, even with just hubby and I. We drink bone broth like crazy, and this pot makes five quarts.  I freeze some and drink some. Also, Thanksgiving is just a block away, and this is going to come in handy!  I wonder if I can jam a turkey in this bad boy?So what do I think of this instant pot?  If you have read this far, you're either totally nuts, or you really want an instant pot.  I have no regrets!  I like this more than the microwave.Oh!  And my first meal turned out delicious!One thing to keep in mind if this is your first: an instant pot isn't REALLY instant. It takes a while to built the pressure, takes time to cook the food, then takes time to release the pressure, if done naturally (without you releasing it...but you can do that too). However, like my sister said, ""It may not be THAT instant, but you don't have to babysit it"".  She's right again! You can set it and not worry about whether it's going to boil over or boil dry. You can throw the food in, set it and spend time with your family. AND as far as bone broth goes, you don't have to cook it for 24 hours!  Four hours, TOPS, and it's not really that long.  Some cook it for an hour.So, if you are still reading this, well, bless your heart! You may need a few sessions of therapy, or you really want this pot!  In either case, I think this is the only time I've ever encouraged people to buy the pot!  Go for it!  You know you want it!  Just say, ""No problem! Ring me up!"" You won't regret buying the Instant Pot!I am not affiliated with the sellers of Instant Pot or Instant Pot company or Amazon. I'm not making ANY money off this review.

For the first week-ish I kind of didn't know what I wanted to do with it/was a bit apprehensive to use it.  The first thing I tried to cook (some steel cut oats) burned and ended up as cement on the bottom of the steel pot.  My mistake...not adding extra water.  Good rule of thumb with these is add 1/2 cup or more extra liquid to the pot on most non liquid-based recipes.  The nice thing was, the pot realized it was burnt, beeped, displayed a burn message and shut the heat off, keeping it from becoming a smoking mess.These days, I load it up, set the timer for when I want it to cook and forget about it.  It takes a bit of time to get used to, but is a really great cooker.  It's actually my most used meal cooking tool.One thing to consider when you are purchasing one is how many people are you cooking for?  If you are just cooking for yourself, you may be better off with a smaller one.  If you are cooking for multiple people, this works wonderfully for that.  While I tend to only cook for myself, I tend to make 2-5 servings of something and store it away to save time later.  If I was just cooking meal-to-meal, for myself, I would probably get a 4qt model or smaller.One very nice feature of it is it's warming feature.  By default, when a meal is done, it will go into warming mode to keep it nice as long as you leave it on.  Great for stews and meals that you are going to go back to later in the day or when you start something, get busy and come back x hours later.",Use it all the time.

The green curry liquid flowed down the side of the stainless steel pot and into the heating well, where it then proceeded to drip down through the inner electronic workings in the bottom of the pot and out through the vents on the bottom, completely ruining the entire thing. It is very disappointing that it is designed this way. Such a commonly owned high dollar machine should not be so easily ruined. Also could have been a safety issue and could have caused some kind of electrical fire or something if not unplugged so quickly.

I’m super impressed.  Some of the dishes don’t save a ton of time once it comes up to pressure then you release the pressure, but the flavor is like you cooked it all day and you basically throw the ingredients in the pot & wait for it to finish. Instead of standing over a hot stove & then being too tired to even eat what I cooked, I just put it in, have a glass of wine, then it’s ready.  Something like a roast I’m sure would save a lot of time.I really like that all the controls are on the base unit, so the top can be immersed in water for cleaning unlike the pressure cooker I have.

The manual is great, but the small recipe booklet that comes with it is limited. I was able to Google some recipes that were great.  There’s also an official Facebook group (members are called pot heads) you can join for tips, recipes, questions, etc. 😀I purchased extra seals to go with my pot because I cook a lot of spicy foods & read sometimes the seal can absorb the ordor. It will be good to have one for sweets and one for savory dishes. They even make a two pack of red & blue seals so you know which one is which.  And, I’ll be set if they become hard to get.

I appreciate the simplicity of use and ease of cleaning. I bought the 10 Qt size to cook large meat items, like a whole @6 lb chicken or an 8 to 10 lb whole turkey. I do not always want to butcher into smaller pieces a whole chicken or turkey--I like to stew the carcass in water with vegetables to render my own chicken or turkey stock for soups, gravies, etc. I used the IP to cook a 5.75 lb roasting chicken. I added 3 cups of liquid to the inner pot and used 6 minutes per pound at normal pressure with 10 minutes of natural pressure release. So for a 5.75-pound chicken, take 5.75 lb x 6 minutes/lb, your lbs cancel out and do the multiplication and you are left with 34.5 minutes. I input 34 minutes. Perfect chicken. I painted Kitchen Bouquet on the skin after and broiled it to brown--even that step did not dry out the chicken, but I would skip it next time because it is a waste of electricity and gets my kitchen too hot. The inner pot is huge so it can handle larger cuts of meat plus vegetables. The line of Instant Pot products are time and energy savers and are easy to clean and maintain. The Duo Nova is a no-brainer to use with the addition of the Smart lid: The new easy seal lid gives you one less thing to worry about because it automatically seals your Instant Pot. Steam release is also a breeze with the fast, safe push of the quick-release button. And it even comes with a bonus sealing ring. Great product.

Friday I cooked rice in it as the first thing...came out great.  Then I had 3 frozen chicken breasts, so I busted those out and did 'em up after the rice.  I've never had such perfectly cooked, hot (heat hot), tender and juicy chicken breasts.  And that was just for starters...So then on Saturday I bought a 4.5 pound chuck roast.  I seared it up first just as you see people do it on the youtubes.  Just look up ""Instant Pot"" and whatever you want to cook, like ""pot roast"" or ""chile"", etc.  I seasoned it up w/ all the regular stuff...nothin' fancy...everyone will use whatever they like to use, so do your thing, it will all come out great in the end.Then I set it on the high pressure meat setting along w/ 2 big chopped sweet yellow onions and let it go for about 35 mins.  After that I released the pressure and opened it up.  All was cooked great already, but then I added chopped up yellow skin taters and carrots which was all I had handy at the time.  Closed it back up again for another 15 mins.I basically turned it into a big stew...and it turned out fantastic.  So easy and only took about 90 mins along w/ prepping time to clean and cut up everything first.So today, since all the ""stew"" had already been wiped out, I seasoned and seared up 2 huge pork tenderloins.  Did same thing as with the chuck roast...pressure cooked them w/ a couple more onions for 35 mins, then opened it up again and added in all the rest of the carrots, onions, and taters I still had left over from before that I didn't use w/ the roast.However...with the pork tenderloins I added in 3 cups of Mojo marinade to give it that Mojo flavor kick.  This was awesome...you all gotta do it.Then I pressure cooked it all again for another 15 mins along w/ letting it de-pressurize naturally for about 10 mins afterwards.  Then I let out the rest of the steam pressure using the quick release valve and opened it up.Again...absolutely amazing.  I basically created a shredded Mojo pork tenderloin stew that is incredible tasting.  Best thing I've ever made and it was only the 3rd thing I've cooked up yet w/ this pot.  I could have added all kinds of other stuff, celery, peppers, etc., but I just didn't have them at the time.  But now that I know how to use this thing w/ the basics and have the timing down, there's no limit to experimenting and cooking up great stuff.And I do recommend getting the 8 quart size unit rather than the 6.  I have the 8 and it's just easy to tell that any unit smaller than this would make it difficult for good size stew type meals or other things like big roaster size chickens, or ribs, etc.  You gotta have the extra room for liquids and other things like lots of carrots, taters, onions, etc.  And with the 8 it seems just big enough for that kinda stuff.  I think if I had bought the 6 I would be frustrated w/ the smaller size, and there also might be more of a chance of overloading it and over pressurizing the smaller one if it's too loaded up.  Better to have the extra room in the 8 size.

It made broth in just a few hours. It made melt-in-your-mouth pot roast in about an hour. I used it about 5 or 6 times, and then the last time I used it steam leaked out the rim of the lid. I watched the help videos on instant pot's website and discovered my ring was slightly stretched--something they admit can happen, though they say infrequently. Since I was well within the warranty period, I contacted them for a replacement. It took two days for them to get back to me and when they did, it was simply to request a picture. A day later, they sent me a note saying they couldn't see the defect, but that perhaps there was a small cut in the ring that they couldn't see. I did not appreciate being treated in this manner. In person, I could clearly see what they could not in a photo--the ring stretched after use. (And not from improper handling.) They asked for my shipping information and my receipt, which I sent. I am waiting for a reply. I assume they will still replace the ring. (I will update here if they do not.) In the meantime, I ordered a replacement ring myself. I'd like to use my pot on a near daily basis and didn't want to have to wait for slow customer service. Replacement rings are over $10 each and the shipping time on them (even with PRIME) is about a month. Their response could have been quicker and more customer friendly, for sure. I don't mind the price of a new ring if they actually last 2 years. I will be upset if the sealing rings don't last for at least 18 months.","Defective Seal, Poor Customer Service, Great Pressure Cooker When It Works",Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,30 people found this helpful,243,42,1865332,Public

Also, being able to throw everything in and have a fantastic white chicken chili come out in less than an hour, is just ideal.To be clear, when you look online, you see stuff about how things cook in ten minutes or twenty-- And, while this is true, that doesn't account for the amount of time it takes to come up to pressure. Last night, I seared a roast (using the saute feature), then put the other things in, and sealed it. It took 10-15 minutes to come up to pressure, in addition to the cook time, so with each meal you have to plan accordingly. It can take more or less time depending on what you're cooking. (For rice it's pretty fast, but when i put frozen chicken in it took like 20 minutes to get up to pressure.)This came with a little recipe booklet, as well as a cheat sheet of reference times for cooking, which is hugely helpful, since I don't always want to google for every single thing I cook.It works as a slow cooker, pressure cooker, has a saute function, can cook rice, make yogurt, steam eggs, and basically anything else you want. It's been helpful for me because I've been able to branch out into different meats that I might not normally have the time or know-how to cook properly.If you're stressed about safety, this is reassuring because the directions are very clear, and it locks in. I was really freaked the first time I used it, and knew nothing about pressure cookers or instant pots at all the first day.  So far we have had no incidents, just be aware that you should NOT use your hand to flip the switch over to release the pressure. Risk of steam burn is huge. I use the handle of a wooden spoon, since I don't like living dangerously.Anyways, the amount of cupboard space this takes up is worth it, and if we had a bigger kitchen I would leave it out all the time on the counter. I love it THAT much.For our family of three, the 6qt capacity is perfect. If you have more than four people in your family though, I don't know if it would be sufficient.Either way, you should buy one of these.",YOU NEED ONE,Size: 6-QTStyle: Duo PlusPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,43,23,2193844,Public

I did some research on electric pressure cookers and realized this one was the one to buy. I haven't had it for long, but it's been great so far. I made the most delicious Lemon Garlic Chicken! It fast and easy. I haven't even scratched the surface of what I can do with this thing. Since this is the most popular brand, there is numerous FB groups and other forums for advice and recipes. My next culinary creation is going to be cheesecake using my Fat Daddio Push Pan. According to the numerous owners in the ""club"" cheesecake is easy and fabulous in the Instant Pot. One thing I would advise is to buy an extra silicone ring, one for savory and one for sweet dishes. The silicone seal absorbs the aroma of onions and garlic and can ""contaminate"" your sweet desserts like cheesecake with the smell of what you last cooked. They can be ordered on Amazon for just a few dollars and are definitely worth the extra money. The 8 quart rings currently take 10-12 weeks to arrive, but hopefully won't take as long at some point in the future. It's always good to have an extra ring anyway. In my opinion, the manufacturer should include an extra ring in the box with the product.One other thing: if you're trying to decide between the 6 quart and the 8 quart, buy the 8 quart. Most people in the IP (Instant Pot) community say if you're buying your first one, you should buy the larger one. Yes, I said your first one. Most people end up buying a second one because it's so versatile and replaces other kitchen appliances like your rice cooker, slow cooker, etc. My ""geriatric"" rice cooker is not going to last much longer, and when it dies, I plan to buy another IP to replace it. Also, be prepared to want to buy some ""accessories"" for your new IP such as the pan I mentioned above. This is so fun to experiment with, you'll want to try to cook things you've never tried before (like cheesecake).",Join the Instant Pot Community.

You can't take it to the sink to run cold water on it to quickly lower the pressure, the way you can with a regular pressure cooker pot, because it weighs too much to carry it. It doesn't beep when the pressure is down. It takes up so much counter space that I put it on a lower cabinet shelf that slides out.

The overall design seems fine, except the labels for the steam release handle were impossible for me to read (black on black) and the manual does not have a useful diagram. Thankfully the proper setting is easy to remember but my first use of the pot was delayed until someone could help me determine the correct setting.My first attempt was beef stew, using a recipe from an instant pot cook book. The vegetables were overcooked and mushy, so I won't be using the IP for stew again. Second attempt was beef short ribs. This was an improvement over the stew but the vegetables were, again, good additions for seasoning the ribs and gravy but too overcooked to enjoy at the table. Third attempt: brown rice. My old rice cooker took about one hour to cook brown rice ready to serve. The time savings were not significant with the iP from start to serve. The IP documentation and many online recipes mislead by stating only pressurized cook times.My next foray with iP will be a curry with Jasmine rice steamed simultaneously in the pot. Before that attempt, I have to buy *one more* accessory for steaming the rice.

This Instant Pot 3qt size is decent for making a week's worth of food for 1 person. You could probably still make a meal for up to 4 but likely would not have leftovers. Actually even when I made my meals I found that the pot filled quickly and I would have to stop because I would be at fill max without adding a lot. This is the only size down from the 6qt so I wish there was a smaller or slightly larger version ie 2.5 qt or 4 qt.For safety features I was largely disappointed. I got burnt by the vent even after waiting 20 minutes and pushing it from the angled tip. Another time I made soup and vented after letting it depressurize by itself. The vent sputtered hot liquid everywhere. Also my unit was purchased from the Amazon Warehouse and it was missing the condensation cup. I tried to contact Instant Pot but had no reply. I also noticed that the lock mechanism on my pot was not secure. Once locked the lid could still jostle around. This wiggling may be standard for an Instant Pot but I did not feel secure using the pot and not having it explode in my face. I had a previous pot from a different company. That pot had a dual lid closure where the 'hinge' itself felt flimsy but when the lid was locked for pressuring it did not move or jostle around. That pot also did not have an angle tip on the vent, it was just a cylindrical vent but anytime I vented it I never had severe stem or liquid overflow and burn me. The lack of safety is the reason I returned this Instant Pot.The hardware of this pot is sturdy and the plastic is matte so it looks and feels nicer. Cleaning the lid was not easy. I had to wash it several times to get rid of residue from one use.The pot was versatile and the main reason I bought it was so that I could make my meals without having to stand by the stove for hours. The only issue I had was the controls. It did not seem intuitive even with the presets. It is described as 7 in 1 but most of the presets had similar settings. On manual, you would have to switch off the Keep warm function. Then it would take up to 15 minutes to come up to pressure which seems really long. I am at an average elevation so that can't be a huge factor. The previous pot I had would take at the most 2 minutes to come to pressure and that was a larger pot.I know Instant Pot is a leader in this market however if I had never had another company's electric pressure cooker I may have kept this Instant Pot. Since I know there are pots that offer better security and ease of controls I would not recommend this at the top of my list. The size is a benefit as there aren't a lot of small electric pressure cookers.","Size a plus, safety not so much",Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,25,10,2990498,Public

But so far not catastrophies or explosions yet. : ) Thinner sauces that do not contain butter or cream seem to do better.I do wonder though whether I should have bought the larger pot instead though. This 3 qt model really does not hold very much given that you have to allow for the steam which uses up about 1/4 of the capacity right there. We are cooking for two adults so I thought the 3 qt would be ideal for us, but now I am not so sure. Any Costco-sized meats which you want to dump into the pot will quickly fill it to overflowing. So if you must make multiple batches of something in order to use up a generous amount of ingredients so that is not such a good bargain in time or electricity or mess. For 1 to 1.5 lbs of meats it is great, beyond that you may not be happy with this size.",Works great.

Okay, realizing there is a problem, but I let it continue, and it did, and beeped, as usual, when it was finished. Then the screen went dark after a few minutes, as usual. The pressure was down, so I could have opened it, but instead I left it on the counter untouched, with the food inside while I continued to read. Now This is the wild part---I left it plugged in, thinking that all was well, it had turned itself off...BUT NO...without me or anyone else (I was home alone) touching it, it came back on, lit up, and the screen all of a sudden said ""26""! On two other occasions, in the three days prior, I also noticed that several times during the timer countdown that the number suddenly increased from say, a ""8"" to a ""9"" several minutes later. My suspicions have come true.  So I have unplugged it, obviously, and I believe I cannot ""trust"" it to be accurate or safe. So I cannot use it. At all. It is dead.

I then checked additional inner pots available for sale separately and it looks like they also have been changed. The stainless steel inner pot sold as an accessory does not have the cups and liters marking, but it does seem like the non-stick ones do.I thought about purchasing the non-stick inner pot just for the marking, but my experience with rice cookers is that the non-stick coating does not last very long before it begins to peel.I have tried to contact Instant Pot via their website multiple times, and they have not responded to me. I believe they are significantly doing an injustice to those who want to use the Instant Pot for cooking rice. My question is why make such a dumb change like this?

After watching several infomercials about electric pressure cookers, I did some research.  This Instant Pot had the best reviews and overall customer satisfaction ratings as well as being quite a bit less expensive than the one I saw on TV!Last night after watching a YouTube video on how to cook a beef roast in the Instant Pot and after reading the instruction manual, I tried that bad boy out.  Below is the recipe I followed with parts I made up myself:Ingredients:1 - 2.5 pound chuck roast4 - red potatoesWeber Chicago Steak SeasoningBeef Bullion CubesGarlic SaltMinced OnionsAbout a tablespoon of cooking oilI took the roast straight out of the freezer and put it on defrost in the microwave just long enough to get it to separate from the wrapper (about 4 minutes).I put the Instant Pot on Saute and let it get up to temperature.  When it read HOT on the display, I put in just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot lightly (about a good tablespoon.)Next, I took the frozen roast and put it in the pot and browned it on all sides and ends.  (This took less than five minutes, total.)After the roast was brown, I added two cups of water and 3 beef bullion cubes, a dash of garlic powder, a good coating of the Weber Chicago Steak seasoning and about four tablespoons of minced onions I got at the dollar store.  I put on the lid and hit the Meat / Stew button and per the YouTube video I watched on how to cook the roast, I moved the time up to 41 minutes, made sure the release valve was set to pressure and walked away.When I heard the timer go off I manually released the steam.  You can do this by gently bumping the release valve so it doesn't all come out at once or just move the release valve to ""release"" and watch it.  Since this was the first time in my life I'd ever used a pressure cooker, I just kept gently bumping the valve to release pressure until the ball thing next to it dropped and I knew it was safe to open the lid.The result was the best roast I've ever had in my life in about a fourth of the time it would have taken me to cook it in the oven.  The meat was tender and juicy but not mushy.  The potatoes had the flavor of the meat all through them and the broth left from cooking I could've used to make gravy, which I didn't because my guys were hungry.  So I saved the broth to use in a stew.  In less than one hour I had a meal that would've taken me three or four hours to cook to the same degree of tenderness in my oven.  The whole kitchen wasn't heated up, and I was left with a single pot to clean.If a novice like me can use this bad boy and have such outstanding results, anybody, and I mean anybody can do it!  And, if you work all day and would rather spend your evenings hanging out with your family than hanging out in a kitchen, do yourself a favor and get this machine!  I'm so glad I did.

Spent more time researching conflicting cooking times on the internet than I did using the appliance, but I finally plopped in a halved squash and let it get to work. Some 45 minutes later, I had mushy, watery, overdone spaghetti squash. Good times.The IP witch coven doesn't speak of the wait time for the unit to come to pressure. Then once it's finally done, you have to tack on another component which adds at least several minutes: Pressure release. X minutes NR, y minutes QR, you mean it's not ready yet?! Factoring in this kind of crap is tedious, especially when added to the trial and error required just to achieve the right cooking time.But I already bought chicken specifically to use in this thing. So.. let's have another go.2lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast. I had gone through so many recommendations and instructions that no one seems to universally agree on, and each one varies slightly depending on several variables. Frozen or fresh? Flattened or thick? PIP or inner lid? I ended up going through the cooking cycle three different times before it was finally done throughout. When it was finally done, I had two watery chicken breasts. Even under absolutely perfect conditions, you're just getting poached chicken in the same time you could do it on the stove.Which brings me to my final attempt: Cheesecake. It was a disaster. I can't.And I don't have to. Because the damn thing broke, haha. After the cheesecake, it flashed a fatal error and I'm forced to return it. I considered an exchange, but by the time I got to that ""Refund to my card"" radio button, there was no turning back.

In particular, it's the best brown rice cooker I've ever used.  It's easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to clean.  All of the parts seem sturdily constructed.  For example, the cook bowl is heavy gauge stainless steel.  The cord is a little short (about 1 meter).  However, it uses a standard ""computer cord"" (IEC C13), so I can easily replace it with a longer one.  It came with a decent instruction manual, and several cookbooks specific to it are available on Amazon.My biggest annoyance is the cook times are ""spun"", ie marketing adjusted them to sound shorter than they actually are.  They do not include heat up, and cool down times.  You have to wait for it to come up to temperature and pressure, before the cook cycle.  After it's cooked, you can release the pressure ""quickly"" or ""naturally"".  Most recipes specify ""natural"", which means the food has to cool down enough for the internal pressure to fall, and the float vent to drop down.  In the case of one cup of brown rice, this increases the 25 minute official ""cook time"" by about 10 minutes to heat up, and another 10 minutes to cool down.  So a ""25 minute"" recipe actually takes about 45.  The recipe book I bought starts most of the instructions with ""preheat the cooker on saute..."".  The instructions that came with it never mention this startup time.A second, very minor annoyance is that you can't see into the pot while cooking.  This is reasonable, since glass would severely weaken the lid.  I would be terrified of a glass lid exploding in my face.","works well, but cook times are ""spun""",Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,699,405,10032,Public

Two large breasts fit just right into the 3Qt pot. I added chicken broth and seasoning, and then I waited. The process was simple and very quick considering that the chicken came straight from the freezer. It was juicy but could have used more seasoning. I plan to try using the Instant Pot again tomorrow with another frozen protein. This definitely takes the stress away from remembering to thaw meat the night before.Overall, I’m quite pleased with this new tool.

If you're deciding between the smaller one or this, go with this 8-QT—so much more versatility to cook larger items like a whole chicken or big batch of soup.That said, there are a few things I'd change about this particular model.1. The seal absorbs smells and stinks. I use this to make bone broth and the seal is like permeated with the smell. It's kind of repulsive. I'd recommend getting two seals if you're going to do something like that so that you don't have to smell it.2. The release valve takes forever to let the pressure out. It's so dang slow. I thought mine was defective, but my friend has the same one and experiences the same thing. It seems like the 6 QT one release pressure much faster. So you have to add on an extra 10 minutes at least just to let the pressure out.3. Takes a long time to get up to pressure. Again, add another 15-30 minutes on top of cook time to get up to pressure.

I have a six quart stove top pressure cooker that I never remember to use, as it requires I stand there and watch it for most of the process.  This sweet new appliance seals, comes to pressure, cooks for the allotted time, and then keeps the meal warm and brings down the pressure all by itself.  I can set it and forget it.  Love the six quart size and the inner stainless steel pot cleans up nicely.  Be aware, this is a pressure cooker.  You are not going to get stir fried veg from this, but inexpensive cuts of meat and legumes will be perfectly cooked.  It does a bang up job on rice and I was so pleased to be able to cook dried beans and have them come out soft and tender.  I am using it at least once a week now, and have used it more in a couple of months than I ever used my stove top pan in the entire time I owned it.  My next venture will be potato salad cooking the eggs and potatoes all at the same time.  Sweet.  There are tons of ideas and recipes on the internet for this, which you will need, as the instruction booklet and recipe booklet leave much to be desired.If you see some mineral deposits develop on the stainless steel inner pot, just put some water and a little cream of tarter in and put the appliance on simmer.  It will disappear and look as good as new.  The exterior wipes clean easily and so does the lid.  The seal does seem to retain odors, but I store mine with some crumpled up newspaper inside, and that seems to absorb the odors.  They do not affect the end product anyway.I think if you cook in large quantities, want to speed things up, and are not looking for ""crisp"" vegetables, you will be thrilled with this appliance",Sweet appliance,Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,878,377,31407,Public

It worked great the first three times, then would not seal.  It ended up either burning the food or steam cooking it.  I went through all the troubleshooting steps and still no luck.  I figured I got a defective one, so I exchanged it for another one.  This one worked for the water test, then a made a beef stew and it turned out awesome.  The next time I tried it, not so awesome.  The same issue started happening, not sealing.  I thought perhaps I had the ring on incorrectly, because surely I couldn't have been sent another defective product.  Nope, still cant get it to work.  So disappointed because that first batch of beef stew was memorable.  Tried contacting customer service with no luck yet.  I am now past the return date on my second instant pot and I'm stuck with this piece of junk.

Instead I use a preset setting and then adjust the time from there. So far so good. I’ve used it this way a handful of times with no issues so far.

It reduces cook times and the amount of dishes I have to do.  I don't have to give it all of my attention like other appliances.  I can take care of the kids while it cooks the meals.  It makes whole chickens in 45 minutes, bone broth in 2 hours, and chili in 40 minutes.  Our first meal was frozen chicken breasts with potatoes, celery, and carrots and it only took 8 minutes.  I don't have to thaw things out anymore or plan ahead.  The pan is really easy to clean out. If it gets anything stuck to the bottom I turn it on saute with water and baking soda and it comes right off.  I don't enjoy dishes so its really helpful to have something that doesn't add more stress in the kitchen.  Eggs and rice come out perfect every time.

The cooker alarmed me right the way ""burned food"" on the display with clear beep sound that I can hear from living room. When I checked food I noticed it was little bit burned in the bottom. I was worried that I probably have to threw away the inner pot because will be difficult to clean it. However, when I clean it next day. It was so easy to clean and removed all the burned spots.

A little history.  My wife wanted to buy a rice cooker, I suggested an Instant pot instead as it would do more.  She was right.  We got a good deal($75) before the holidays and I put in a serious effort to get to know this thing.  Right off the bat, I got a lot of 'BURN' notices (sic, remember the show?).  Even when using recipes specific to this item?  BURN.  Usually 2-3 before actual pressure cooking.  BURN, open, scrape/stir/add liquid, repeat.  Tomato soup?  BURN!  Sauce, stew, vegetarian/chicken/beef chili, pulled chicken, chicken stock?  BURN!  It takes a lot of the speed out of the thing, especially if you're not watching for the BURN, come back expecting a finished meal only to be disappointed.  I researched, changed how I stacked things in the pot.  Stopped sauteing in it completely.  BURN BURN BURN.  So, over a week ago I finally after waiting too long for an exchange and possibly return,  contacted Instant Pot's support.  I got an open support ticket with an email.....that's it.  Eight days and not a peep.  They mention a holiday backlog?  The holidays that ended weeks ago?  I even tried replying to my own support ticket to see if it kicked the tires?  Nope.  Either they're completely inundated with problems or incapable of support OR maybe I didn't reach the level of deserving support?  Any way you look at it, if you're thinking of buying this should concern you.  I am ashamed that I fell for the whole 'cult' thing that seems to drive this product, I thought I was immune to and wary of fanboyism.  To be fair, all but one batch of rice didn't 'BURN' nor did the one time one made chicken soup, so it's not all failure.  This is supposed to be a time saver and my experience proves it's anything but.  Even as a rice cooker, I tested it side by side with my stovetop method and starting from cold, the Instant Pot is almost a minute slower.

She agreed, and I proceeded to check for recipes for BBQ Baked beans from scratch.  Let's just say we were both impressed beyond expectations and I'm now waiting for her to use this on her own.I went for the 8 quart size because I truly believe bigger is better and offers more options.  It's just me and the girlfriend, but when I/we cook, we like having extra, which we freeze with our FoodSaver in 1-2 portion bags.  This is a large machine, but I'm happy I went big, as it opens up so many more options for cooking.As a pressure cooker, I'm still amazed how easy it is to use and how great the results are.  I mean, instead of soaking my beans overnight, changing water several times, and then having to slow cook them the entire next day, I had my beans completely done in less than 2 hours from start to finish, and there are actually recipes that can be completed in half that time.  I've read and seen frozen, raw meat being cooked to what appears to be perfection in less than 30 minutes.  Crazy cool.Another reason I went for this (and went big) was the slow cooker functions.  We have 2 crock pots and neither one works like I'd like it to.  The lids never fit remotely tight, steam and whatever we're cooking spits out constantly, and getting the thing up to real heat takes well over an hour.  Here, with the Instant Pot, you can first of all sear your meat or saute your vegies in mere minutes, as in you have real, serious heat faster than an electric range!  And then, simply change the heat to slow cooker put on your nicely fitting glass lid (you'll have to purchase that separately, though), and crock pot away.  You can even use a ""keep warm"" setting and let peeps serve themselves from your kitchen island.Again, I got this for the insane price of $69, and it's now showing at $122, but I'm telling you, this thing is worth its weight in gold and can replace so many kitchen appliances.  Time is not an enemy of mine, yet I foresee using this very often.  If time isn't on your side, you'll find you can cook amazing meals in a mere fraction of the time it would take you using standard appliances.This is truly an A+ appliance and a must in every kitchen.",Wow...just WOW!,Size: 8-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,412,96,58362,Public

This instant pot /lives/ on their counter, because they use it so frequently. They have a small kitchen, so no room for a rice cooker, a slow cooker, and a pressure cooker. For their cooking needs, it does a mighty fine job. So why did I ding 1 star off? Because the sautee function is NOT a searing function at all. It gets the thing hot enough to sweat your aromatics, but not properly get a solid sear going on them. Same goes for whole spices. If that heat got hot enough as it claims to do, I could pop whole spices. I cannot. This will not replace a stove and some good pots.Instead, treat it as a simple cooking tool. You can chuck something in there that takes forever to cook, and go ahead and sort out your spices, onions, garlic, etc on the actual stove. Once the long-cooking thing is done cooking, combine with the stuff on the stove, and you're good to go.One more thing. I will STRONGLY suggest that you do not start this with cold water. It will take forever and a day to get up to full pressure. Remember what I said about the sautee function being garbage? The same goes for boiling water. You start this guy off with cold water, and you'll be starving long before you hit full pressure. Instead, I'll suggest that you have an electric kettle on hand to have some good boiling water on hand to tip into the pressure cooker, and then you'll ""only"" wait like 8 or so minutes to hit full pressure.Personally, I think this whole Instapot thing is a cult, and y'all don't know any better, because you've not used a real stove top pressure cooker. For the people that have bought into the cult, however, it is a life-saver. There's ladies at the office to whom I've suggested this device, and 100% of them swear by it now.I'll stick to my Hawkins and the stove, but if you're not an avid cook, this is perfect for you.",Still going strong a year later.,Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,3044,713,2997,Public

I actually bought it because of a story I saw on Facebook about a woman getting burned when it ""blew up"". I had to find out how that could happen. I am not new to pressure cookers or how they work. So I do know that in certain circumstances it can happen. But usually because of human error.First off - you have got to clean EVERY part on the lid after each use. That means taking out the ring, taking apart the rest of the lid pieces and washing all the holes. I use a thick pipe cleaner. Food and oils can build up and block the holes and that is not good. Lightly oil your rubber gasket after each use then wipe it dry with a paper towel to get off any extra.Do NOT over fill the cooker. Those guide lines on the side are there for your protection. If you over fill it can cause food to clog the vents and that is never good.This has a lot of safety features and what she said happened in the story just could not have happened the way she said.The most dangerous part of this pressure pot is the steam release and if you are not paying attention you will get hurt. When you open the steam release put a towel over your hand and keep your face away. That steam comes out fast and hot and you will get scalded if you have your face over it. turn the knob from below the steam hole and never over the top. It's not a toy but it can be so much fun if you do it right.I figure what happened to that lady is she released the vent with her face there and she just did not want to admit she made a mistake. She said she let it stand for 40 minutes to cool, the steam vent had dropped and no steam came out the release and when she took the lid off it was still under pressure.It has a safety that does not allow the lid to come off under pressure. After 40 minutes it should have been cooled down enough, the other possibility is she filled it too full and it stuck the valve shut so it looked like the pot had cooled enough. But she also said she released the steam release and nothing came out.It has a pretty good instruction book. Facebook has some good groups that are dedicated to pressure pots and you can get a lot of information there. There are also websites but I found some of the facebook sites faster for asking point blank questions.All in all, I think this is a very good unit and I use it a lot and really enjoy it.

I've watched countless videos on youtube and pored over just as many recipes and they all make it look 100% foolproof - my experience, however, has been far from that. Like many, I waited a couple weeks after receiving my IP to work up the nerve to use it, but after all the hype, what could go wrong? The initial water test went fine. Moved on to boiled eggs; seemed to go well until it switched over to count down & 'burn' warning flashed - added more water and worked. Next day attempted a package of bagged, frozen Chicken thighs - all seemed well, but when it got up to 'pressure', the display flickered & flashed 'burn' - ? Did quick release, added more liquid, and then all went well. Tried a bag of frozen chicken breasts, following day and experienced same 'burn' message 2 times before finally worked. Over the next couple days, made yogurt & steel cut oats - both 'worked' and came out well, though the yogurt did not come up to initial temp w/first try; had to use saute setting to get it there. Did another water test last night to make sure the pot was actually 'ok' and not faulty, and after it sealed/reached pressure, steam began shooting out of release knob/handle just like during a quick release. Tried again, same thing. Ended up calling Instant pot's help line and tech told me to attempt with 3 cups of water; I did & all went perfect. *In the 100's of vids I've watched or read almost every single one calls for '1 cup' of water/liquid - this has not worked ONCE for me and it is beyond frustrating. If the pot is going to require 3 or more cups of liquid, I might as well boil the food in a pot on the stove. I am a fairly accomplished cook ,but this device has tried my patience like nothing else. It has not been 'Instant' nor easy. Not happy & very disappointed.","So far, a big disappointing Meh.

I tried calling the manufacturer and got a message saying they were not open and to contact them during regular business hours.  I then went back on Amazon and started the return process again and I was allowed to go ahead and start the return process.  I have to say, that I printed up the shipping label put the pot back in the box, took it to the local UPS Store, before I got home Amazon had already sent an email stating that the product had been returned and my account had been credited.  THAT, My friends is awesome service.  I will most likely buy another instapot from Amazon, as I know they are a good product, my neighbor swears by hers, and we both started out with pots by another manufacturer they both worked great but the finish inside the Pot itself started to flake off so we both figured Instapots Stainless Steel Pot was the way to go.

The one I received first was the bigger one and my god it was massive, i would not know where to keep it if I kept it.-easy to use - the pre set program is easy to follow. I mostly use the Pressure Cook & stew and broth functions - just chop up everything, close the lid, press the button and thats it. It makes really earthy, wholesome soups, broth and stews! I made russian borsh, hungarian goulash and irish stew... turned out just as good as you buy at restaurants.-nice and sturdy - the lid has a good weight to it and it does not feel like it is going to explode in any minute.-great value - for about 60 quid this is a bargain. I ve seen there are smarter ones like you connect it to your phone and leave it be and all that but this is good enough for me!-inner pot is great - it is anti stick and washes off quite easily - even boiled milk which leaves a very sticky bottom that is hard to get rid of.Cons:-the only negative is the aftersmell. I tried using vinegar, baking soda etc but the smell is still there. But i can live with it.Overall I am very happy with this pot! It is one of my kitchen staples!First review:Okay, so they clearly sent me an open-box, damaged instant pot... i ordered the 6 quart one but they sent me the larger one.Also the side of it was badly smashed and looked terrible.

Today I made country ribs with homemade bbq sauce, all in the pot, from browning the meat and the onions, stirring up a bbq sauce from scratch. It turned out so perfectly I may never again waste money at a rib shack, where the chance of getting dried up ribs is pretty high. The 3 qt size works well for one person with leftovers for 1-2 more meals, or with soups, to freeze a couple of pints in addition to eating all you want for a couple of days. Sauteing is a little tricky because the bottom of the pan is slightly convex, so if you use only a small quantity of oil, it goes to the edges leaving the center without oil. I will shop for silicone grip pot holders that pinch in order to manage the hot stainless pot for tasks like stabilizing while stirring, and draining the extra oil needed before progressing from saute to pressure mode.",A lot of fun. very versatile and easy to clean.,Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,431,285,106207,Public

It's a wonderful device!!!!BUT. The Pot has evidently a design flaw, maybe the type of plastic, maybe the manufacturing process, I don't know, that causes the lid to melt right at the back pressure lock. I see that many people have complained of this, thinking that they themselves caused it by setting the lid down on the stove or whatever. None of that applies to me! Mine is not near my stove and I haven't set it down on a hot object. This is obviously a design flow on the part of Instant Pot. I hope they fix it!!! See the pictures of where the thing melted, and I can't close the lid to seal it now.Problem #2 is, they are totally out of stock with replacement lids. To boot, the replacement lids are $66.00, a brand new unit is $79 or so!!! I'll buy another one because I love it, and have invested in many accessories, a second stainless steel pot, spare sealing gaskets, you name it, so i don't want to try a different brand. But really! That's an outrageous price!!! I believe they should replace my lid, and fix their problem, I've contacted them but haven't heard back yet. If I find satisfaction, I'll report back here.The other flaw in this appliance is the slow cooker function doesn't work well. I thought I'd be able to give my Crock Pot away and make my carnitas with the Instant Pot!!! But the Instant Pot slow cooker function doesn't get up to the temperature to cook the meat, even on the high setting. All it does is just keep it warmer than the warm, but not as hot as the saute.

i still have these and still use them.one of the first things i did with this was make a slow cooked chicken soup. it did wonderfully. i was thrilled that i could set the time and adjust the heat. i also used the saute option for onions and garlic before throwing everything in and slow cooking. a note for those who may have read some reviews stating that the cooker lid doesn't work in slow cook mode and gives the ""lid"" message. to use the original lid, you have to twist the lid to close position and turn the knob to vent. i guess the electronics of the cooker detects that the lid isn't secure if you just place the cover over it and don't turn it close. i'm actually very happy that i bought the glass lid because the cooker works seamlessly with it and i can see what's going on. most of my usage in the first few days was slow cooking different soups. they turn out great and the keep warm feature keeps the food at the right temperature to serve and eat without needing to heat the food again. and it's not super hot either, which my husband prefers. five stars.the real test of the instant pot came when using it as a pressure cooker and this is where i had to knock one star off. at first, it did great. i pressure cooked soaked raw chickpeas. perfect result. then, when i realized it was not enough for the number of people i was cooking for, i followed it up immediately with pressure cooking unsoaked chickpeas. perfect again. i mixed the two batches and you couldn't tell the difference. five stars still.then came the chicken curry. turn on saute, throw in onions, ginger, garlic, spices, brown to perfection. good so far. now, being a veteran pressure cooker user, i have made small to large batches of chicken and meat in my hawkins and have never had to worry that the cooker is too full. with this one, as soon as the level went beyond 2/3rds, i didn't get any pressure. okay. so it's electronic, so i'll keep the five stars and make sure the level stays below the recommended level. however, even when the level is half full, there are still days when it won't build pressure. the element heats, the timer begins and ends, but no pressure. one day the level was less than half and i still had to start and stop a couple of times before i actually got pressure. by this time the food was half cooked anyway, so not quite as convenient as i would have liked.before you say ""clean the lid and rim"", i would have you know that i clean the lid every time, as recommended in the book, removing every part as described and washing and drying them thoroughly and i also clean out the rim which, if you own this, is hard to get under. but i clean it nonetheless (because i'm a clean freak). so, i'm sorry instant pot makers, but the pressure is a little unreliable. and for many of us who cook regularly and need things that just work, this doesn't qualify for me as that quite yet. for me it's been 50/50 on the pressure cook score.that said, when used as a slow cooker or when pressure cooking beans like chickpeas, this thing is a champion.another note for the indian cooks: i made gaadhe aloo in this to go with kachoris. peeled and rough chopped the potatoes, briefly sautéed the spices in the pot, threw the potatoes into the pot on slow cook, added water and left them to cook. when done, mashed up the potatoes right in the pot to create the thick gravy with chunks of potato. perfection. i haven't tried dal yet, but i will update when i do.conclusion: i have owned this for a couple of months now and have used it a lot, almost every day. i love the convenience of it, love the slow cook and saute with adjustable options, ADORE the stainless steel insert, but only just like the pressure cooker. all in all, a good investment. so far. i would recommend.","So far so good, for western and Indian food",Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,146,34,2106979,Public

Wrong. It is extremely difficult to clean, requiring extensive scrubbing after each use. Even using the dishwasher didn't work. The cooked-on residue seems permanent. The pot also still smells of the last item cooked after much additional scrubbing. The lid seal area is also very difficult to clean and requires lots of patience to clean the latching areas. The cheap ""stainless"" pot sticks to food like glue when sauteing, leaving many bits burned to the bottom.  Non-stick coatings were invented decades ago so I don't know why they use this very cheap pot. It ruins the entire usability of the appliance. The pot is poorly designed - In addition to sticking, the bottom indentation makes it impossible to saute anything properly since liquid immediately drains to the side unless you pour in well over a cup to fill the area level. Slow cook function takes many hours longer than a standard crock pot, even on high (the ""More"" setting). The pressure cook function seems to work fairly well which is the only way I got a roast to cook in a reasonable time. Something else about the bare metal pot - it negatively affects the flavor of food cooked in it. Compared to my standard ceramic crock pot, which makes spectacular roasts, the Instant Pot seems to strip some of the flavor from the foods, especially onion and garlic. Using the same pot roast recipe, the difference in taste between the two was not even close. The pot does not seems to be high quality stainless. I'm not sure what it is but I intensely dislike it. I haven't tried many of the cooking programs like Rice, Cake, Eggs, Porridge, Yogurt, so I can't say how they perform. I bought it mainly for the combo saute and slow cooker functions but it fails miserably at these simple things so I'm returning it.",Does NOT meet the hype,Size: 6-QTStyle: Duo PlusPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,348,149,153896,Public

Because electric pressure cookers have suddenly caught on, finding reliable sources of recipes for all the things that an Instant Pot can do is tough. There are thousands of amateur recipes flying around. Every day hundreds and maybe thousands of new recipes are posted on Pinterest and Facebook and cooking blogs. Some of them are amazing, but some are way off. Even the Instant Pot Recipe book that came with both of my Instant Pots is screwy. On page 26, there is a recipe for ""3 Minute Steel Cut Oats"". I tried it, my Steel Cut Oats were as chewy as wood. In looking back to see what I did wrong, I was flipping through that same book. On page 32 there are cooking time tables which show that you need to cook Steel Cut Oats for on high pressure for 10 minutes.Getting cooking times right is a little tricky in that you need to adjust for the amount of liquid you are bringing up to heat, and the mass and starting temp of the food that needs to warm enough for the steam to start building up enough to hit pressure and start the ""high pressure cook time"".Again, finding reliable recipes and adjusting cooking times is the quirkiest thing, but if I had it to do all over, I would still have 2.

It is a pressure cooker. The chief reason it's better than a regular pressure cooker is that it keeps the consistent temperature and pressure for a set amount of time. This makes you able to use it to get food ready faster without constant watching, much like a slow cooker - it can also BE a slow cooker.Also, you are not taking up stovetop space while cooking. Seems like there are way too many buttons, I generally use the bottom two and the -+ to set time, but I've only had it a month and may use other buttons in the future. (LOVE it for dried beans in chili or soup!)The darn thing is designed for right handed people - the plug is on the right side of the back and the lid lock and pressure relief seem backward to me - but I'm used to making those accommodations. BTW, the pressure relief turning stick looks like a spout - but that is actually just a plastic ""handle"" for your thumb to push over, so don't be hesitant to use it.

He finally got interested in fixing his own food verses eating out like he had been doing for way too long. He started looking for new recipes, fixed two meals and then became bummed when the cooker wouldn't even heat up! So, he's used this at the most 8 times. I have two crock pots that are over 15 years old that I use weekly, and they still work perfectly!!

I hope these are additional points. I've done a whole dinner in 45 minutes from saute start to natural release finish without adding a degree Fahrenheit to my kitchen. I have not thrown it on a meter to test the power consumption but I suspect that it's a  fairly low total compared to using a stove or a slow cooker for several hours, plus it doesn't heat up your house in summer so will save your A/C from overwork. We already know it's a time saver but also the net power savings will add up over time.There is a learning curve and it requires some trial and error. I found there is no one rule of thumb for adapting stove-top PC recipes to this one that will work consistently. Do not think you can just add 15-25% time to recipes for nonelectric cookers. I took six books out of the library, four were written for stove-top models, one for mostly electric pots and one that gives times for both in each recipe. The one consistent thing I've found is that the Instant Pot loses very little liquid so I usually add less than called for. Some recipes need extra time for electric, some do not, and some need even less time though they were written for stove-top and 15 lbs pressure. Err on the low side. You can always close it up and add a few more minutes of cook time (don't forget the extra cooking while it releases pressure) but you can't uncook a soggy mess!If you have a good library check out some books, or go online -- there's ton of info. Start with Instant Pot's own site and check out Laura Pazzaglia's hippressure blog. Those two sites have stuff that's specifically for the electric pots and shouldn't need to be adapted. Check out other food sites, and read the comments as you will learn from people who've tried to alter stove recipes for an electric pot.Consider purchasing an extra gasket. Odors like onion and garlic tend to cling and you want to thoroughly wash and dry a gasket before storing it. Having an extra one helps, plus you will hopefully not get stuck in years hence needing a gasket that may no longer be available (happened to me with an ancient Presto).I contacted Instant Pot support once with a random question and they got back to me very quickly. Good company with a good product. I highly recommend the Instant Pot and consider it one of my better purchases.I hope somebody finds this helpful.

The Instant Pot gives me HOPE !!  I've used it several times since receiving it in early January.  It offers a range of tools from simple to complex.  Until I become totally familiar with it, I have to double check the user's manual, but when I don't try to ""wing it"" I have great success.I find that with some cuts of meat, I have to add time to the cooking because they just need more time.  For example, corned beef takes longer than most recipes will suggest.  It was much better the second day with additional cooking.So far, my best outcomes have been chicken cacciatore, chili and beef stew.  Next up will be chicken breasts and pork roast.  I expect to be successful.One suggestion:  if the cut of meat is likely to be tough try using the pressure cooker setting as in the recipe, then turn it to a lower/slower setting for another hour (or whatever time you think it needs).  My beef stew was better the second day because when I reheated it, I actually was cooking it longer.I think I will need to experiment with what works best for each cut of meat and learn from experience.SO GLAD I bought this thing !!  Because, so far, it's given me great results.  Lots of recipes on line, too.I really like the saute feature as most recipes allow you to saute the meat and onions/garlic/celery etc., then add the other ingredients, close the lid, and set it/forget it.One thing I have to remember is to allow it to get to full pressure before manually setting the timer.  A couple of times I thought it was cooking only to discover that I had not let it get to pressure.READ THE USER'S GUIDE !!!  And check out all the online recipes.Actually, I just sent one to my sister who needs to start eating healthier meals on a limited budget.UPDATE:  FEB 15REMEMBER WHEN I SAID TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS?  Well, I was using the TIMER button instead of the ADJUST button.  So all I was doing was delaying the start of the cook time.  DUH !!!  Setting the Instant Pot to cook my items manually requires me to FIRST set the pressure.  THEN, manually ADJUST the time up or down using the ADJUST button.

Not now. If I cooked my famous Tarragon Chicken in a new slow cooker, it was overcooked, dry, and stringy after only two or three hours. I was incredibly disappointed.So, I heard wonderful things about the Instant Pot, and it was made in Canada, so I hoped they didn't have to go by FDA mandates. Imagine my disappointment when I found the same results with the slow cooker feature. My Tarragon Chicken couldn't go all day in this slow cooker either. The most it could go, even on the ""low"" setting, was about two hours max. Some of my ""foodie"" friends on a local food blog said to use the pressure cooker setting, but if I'd wanted a pressure cooker, that's what I'd buy. I realize I have that option, but I just wanted a real ""slow cooker"" like I had back in the day. I guess that's no longer and option. The FDA thinks we no longer no how to cook, even though we've been using slow cookers for decades, and have managed to live to tell the tale!So, while the Instant Pot surely has many different functions that I haven't explored, and I probably will, what I bought it expressly for, what a big disappointment to me.",Not Really a Slow Cooker,Size: 8-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,285,175,105994,Public

For instance, I learned to throw a kitchen towel over the top if I press quick vent so as not to get a steam burn or send a force of steam to the ceiling and cupboards. Also, to make sure to buy extra seals because the smells of the food absorb into your rubber seal. The recommendation is to have one each for cooking veggies, meats, and sweets.

But I started seeing lots of meatless instant pot recipes online and finally decided to take the plunge. I just got mine last week and have made two recipes so far, and both were so quick and easy I am completely sold. I have ordered a couple of cookbooks and have started looking for Thanksgiving recipes, because this is the best thing ever.First, I spent a long time deciding on which pot to buy. I had almost decided on the basic Duo, because I don't think I'll ever sou-vide, and I don't bake often so don't care about the baking option. But I realized that if it was an option I would definitely  forget to seal the lid! The Nova is basically the Duo but with an automatic sealing lid - totally worth it. Also an easier to read display, apparently, which I'm 100% in favor of since I'm old. I also went back and forth on 6 quart versus 3 quart. We're mostly 2 people, sometimes 3, so I easily could have gotten away with a 3, but decided on a 6 for three reasons: 1) most recipes are written for a 6 quart, 2) I LOVE leftovers, and 3) extra Holiday cooking capacity for guests.So last week when I got the pot I put it all together and ran the water test, and immediately went online looking for recipes. I found a recipe for Spiced Red Lentil Sweet Potato soup, and other than sauteing the onion and garlic (right in the pot!) I just plopped in all of the ingredients, pressed the appropriate buttons and it was done in about 20 minutes. I started the recipe at 4:00 because that was when I finished the water test, and I was excited, but because of comments online I knew I could just leave it until we were ready to eat! So nice! When I opened it at 6 everything was hot and perfectly cooked and delicious!Today we had a friend visiting who needed a snack because of low blood sugar. It was 3:30 and after giving him crackers and cheese I offered to make a cauliflower mac and cheese and it was so simple - just dump most of the ingredients, cook and then stir in the cheese. Again, so quick and easy, and delicious!We won't be having any guests for Thankgiving this year thanks to Covid, but for the two of us I think I can put a turkey breast with some onions and herbs in the instant pot with potatoes above to steam, then make the gravy right in the pot from the drippings, mash the potatoes and DONE. Roasted brussel sprouts and pecan pie in the oven. Stove top stuffing or home-made stuffing in the slow cooker. Easy peasy. I think this will be my easiest Thanksgiving EVER!I'm looking forward to trying lots more recipes! If you're on the fence, go for it. If you're not going to sou-vide I can recommend the Duo Nova. Sometimes simpler is better. I can't help with your decision on the size, though. My first recipe made so much food I haven't had to do much cooking since! It definitely made me think the 3 quart would have been fine.

Then it flipped off, then he went back to the timer and went back on cooking? But when cooking was done, it did have some burned stuff on the bottom. All the times I've cooked in my pressure cooker I never had any burn stuff on the bottom?This is kind of a puzzle to me?

It has more settings on it which I haven't really tried them all out yet. But time will tell I guess. My pressure cooker was never really good at cooking rice, even though it had a rice button on it. I haven't tried that on the instant pot yet. That might have to be one of my next projects on the instant pot.I haven't tried hard boiled eggs in it yet either. I've heard people have had success doing that, and I've heard other people have had a hard time with it.Hopefully this instant pot the last as long as my last pressure cooker did, actually I still have it and it still works.

And then last weekend we had a girl's weekend and the neighbor said that she loved her instapot. Enter Amazon. So after the girls weekend I did a little exploring on YouTube and Amazon. Decided that the instant pot duo Nova for beginners was best for me. So glad I did! It arrived on Wednesday. Took it out today which is Saturday almost 4 days later. Watched a bunch of safety videos on YouTube for do's and don'ts which was very smart because you don't want to dive into a contraption like this without knowing some safety protocols. Being a Navy veteran safety is everything it sets the landscape. . first thing I made was risotto. Follow the instructions after watching a YouTube video... 20 minutes was not enough following the instructions but I put it in for another 20 minutes and guess what? Perfect risotto. Later on I was starving and decided on making barbecue chicken. I don't like sweets and not crazy about barbecue but I thought what the hell I have both ingredients and it's on hand. Guess what happened? Came out perfect. Absolutely freaking delicious perfect fall off the bone chicken.

This is a consequence of all the heat being applied through only the bottom to the standard supplied stainless steel pot, the relatively poor thermal conductivity of stainless steel, and the lack of any convection (stirring) whatsoever. I replaced with the aftermarket ceramic coated aluminum pot (much better thermal conductivity) and no more burn messages.The other caveat is that the claims of very fast cooking ignore the long heat up times, typically a half hour, and the long de-pressurize times...an hour, typically, unless you use the VERY MESSY quick pressure release method. You may just cook for a half hour, but in reality your cooking takes about two hours from when you seal the pot's lid until the lid pressure lock disengages. Even then, the contents may be too hot to serve. You can, of course, do a quick pressure release, by turning the relief valve to vent, but then you get a geyser of very hot steam, and probably some of your pot food contents, too. Been there, tried that, never again. Dangerous and makes a mess.Overall, however, it cooks great. So far have made beef stews and bean and ham hock soups and results were wonderful.

The steam release valve is a bit messy and a deep-clean can be a pain, but those are my only real complaints. When cooking, keep in mind this takes about 10-15 minutes to initially warm up before the actual cooking time starts. For example, a 5 minute cooking time for jasmine rice is misleading.

I never reviewed any of them.  But from the moment I received my Instant Pot, I felt that I had purchased something that not only exceeded my expectations, but will make my life easier (and more delicious)!I am a holistic nutritionist and a follower of a lower carb/paleo/primal lifestyle (and yes, it is not only a food regimen, but a lifestyle).  Many of the meals I prepare require advance planning and preparation, and I am OK with that, realizing that it is an investment in my family's health and wellbeing.  I was looking for something that would support my food choices and perhaps make it a little less time-consuming.  I have used a crockpot extensively over the past years and while I appreciate the ease of use and the ability to put a meal on the table soon after I got home in the evening, there is that ""everything tastes the same"" factor I was running into with my family.So I began thinking about ways to cook my meals faster and realized that a pressure cooker may be the answer.  But, I am scared of pressure cookers.  Even though my head tells me that people have been using them for many years with no problems, my heart said there was a strong chance I could blow up the entire kitchen, myself included.  I had no idea there were electric, programmable pressure cookers out there that would virtually eliminate that worry until I began researching them, first on Amazon, and then on other websites.  I eventually purchased the Instant Pot over the others because of the stainless steel insert (no aluminum), the size of the pot (I wanted a larger capacity), and the ease of use.The day it arrived, I plugged it in and began reading the manual.  The manual was very helpful, even included a suggested trial run to familiarize one with the basics.  My first meal was potato soup (I know potatoes are not low carb or paleo, but once in a while you gotta have potato soup).  I was amazed at how easy and delicious it was to make this soup that would normally take a couple of hours.  I just coarsely chopped the vegetables, threw those in the pot, added the seasonings and the liquid, started the pressure cooker option, and in 20 minutes all I had to do was use my immersion blender to puree the soup, add some cheese, stir and it was ready to eat.  AND the soup was every bit as good as my slower version that keeps me tied to the kitchen to stir and monitor until it's done.  That is the hidden beauty of this appliance, that while it's cooking your food, you are free to do other things such as harass your kids to get their homework done.  No more watching over a pot!My second recipe was lemon pepper chicken wings.  There is a searing option, so first I browned the wings in a bit of butter, then added lemon pepper, salt, and 2 more tablespoons of butter.  Put on the lid, set the pressure cooker for 25 minutes, and out came the most delicious, fall-of-the-bone wings just loaded with flavor.  The family went wild!I also made mushroom gravy (no flour) pork chops in 30 minutes in the pressure cooker - the gravy was so good my son ate in on top of some gluten free noodles the next day for lunch - and a breakfast meat loaf in the slow cooker, also a winner.I am also using this to reheat food since we don't use the microwave anymore and I'm finding that it seems easier and makes less of a mess than going stovetop.That's a pretty long review for a first-timer but I am so enthusiastic about this product that I just had to share.",Review from a confirmed foodaholic,Size: 6-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,"9,711 people found this helpful",9800,2,9799522,Public

I'm old guy and I eat pretty simple.  The Instant Pot and an occasional frying pan coupled with my barbecue is all that I need.  Don't be scared about all of the buttons.  The ones on the left are all low pressure (probably means a lower temp heating element) and the ones on the right are for high pressure (probably means higher temperature heat element).  Different buttons have different preset times, and pressures but they all seem to remember their last setting so you can use them for whatever you want.  Or as I do I just use the steam button all of the time and change the temperature and when and if that fails I'll move on to another button.  It's pretty simple to use and pretty safe although you really want to stay away from the vent when your opening it early.  The vent control would be a lot nicer if it were longer so that you can keep your hand away from it more.  Don't forget to only put your stuff in the stainless pot.BTW if you searching the Amazon database and you run into my reviews and think oh this is a guy we'd like to review our products.  Don't bother, I won't review stuff just to make money and I won't give a good review unless it deserves it and I won't purchase or accept items for review unless I really want them and I probably won't take anything for free because my experience is that nothing worthwhile is ever for free.After using them for awhile I find them a little unreliable.  I wouldn't recommend setting the up to run and then going somewhere because all to often I find that they will leak a little our of the steam vent or sometimes the main seal comes out and if you're not there and listening for problems then you could probably cause a burnout.  So I would never use the delay cooking option.  Some will say that if you get the seal on correctly that you'll have not problems but how do know for sure?  I don't think there as reliable at a crock pot.  But I still like them .",Set it and Forget it,Size: 3-QTStyle: DuoPattern Name: Pressure CookerVerified Purchase,,433,158,458070,Public

Since obtaining the pot, I tried making yogurt at least a half dozen times, with the final product always very runny.

I sent the pot back through the Yogurt/Boil function again and after 15 minutes, it beeped it had reached temperature. This time, checking the milk with 3 different thermometers (2 were electronic), I saw an average temp of 166 degrees. My thought is that being 15 degrees cooler at a programmed 180, the machine was likely to be cooler at its fermentation temperature. I finished making my yogurt by other means.Attempting to get help from Instant Pot customer service has proven frustrating.

Love those, but purchased this for the convenience factor. With this model you can simply load your pot, set it, and not have to go adjust the temperature or time it once you start it. The additional benefit is you if  don't get right to it when finished, it will automatically set itself to keep it warm until you are ready. The drawback to the electric version compared to the stove top is that the stove top models are much faster.I was pleased with how relatively little room this took up on my counter, and it is lighter than I expected. There are a multitude of preset functions to help take the guesswork out, but be warned you still should confirm the cooking time prior to use. The stainless steel pot is terrific- avoid buying units that are coated as they will not last as long. You may also use it on a gas stove to brown in first, or simply use the browning option offered by the cooker. Note that this only has about 11 psi for the ""high pressure"" setting, so if using a stove top cooker recipe you will need to increase the time by 7%-15% to compensate. This is a 6 quart model, so if you have a large family (more than 4 people) look for something with a bigger capacity. I use a 10 quart Fagor model frequently for this reason. The directions to set up the pot are just so-so. One tip is when placing the lid on for the first time, set the arrow to the ""open"" spot, not matching the arrow on the unit. This is different than my stove top models, as with those you first align the arrows and then rotate the lid. Cleaning the pot is easy so no worries about it not being a non-stick type.Recipes- there are not many recipes provided with this unit, but enough to give you a little something to work with. When purchasing a cookbook I would recommend one designed for electric cookers in order to take the guesswork out of how to adjust the time. Bob Warden's book ""Great Fast Food"" has nice and easy recipes with common ingredients, and ""The Great Big Pressure Cookbook Both Stovetop and Electric"" is even better given times are listed for both types of pots and there are a lot of terrific recipes to choose from. I am a big fan of the Lorna Sass cookbooks, but those times are for stove top cookers so be prepared to do a lot of adjusting. If you are new to pressure cooking, go with the Great Big Pressure Cookbook, as it has a solid intro section on how to use the cooker. Check out the blog called ""Dad Cooks Dinner"" for more tried and true recipes that you don't have to pay for, and be sure to try the mac and cheese recipe there! Instantpot.com also has a bunch of recipes specific to the pot so that is worth a look.Update: I am shocked how much I use this- mujltiple times every week. It has simplified cooking,and I have easily saved the the cost of the gadget by the dramatic reduction in how much we go out to eat. Yogurt is much easier to make in this compared to my former yogurt maker, and I can make a large quantity (takes up to a gallon of milk). There is a Facebook group that offers a wealth of ideas and quick answers to questions so check that out. I have already bought more of these units to give as gifts, and I will be purchasing a second one for my home. Consider the used models- I bought one of these ""warehouse"" deals- it came in pristine condition and not sure how it was even considered used other than likely an unopened return. Cost was only 75 for that one, so a great deal. Hubby made some custom made cutting boards to put over my gas burners- because yea, not using the stove much anymore and this allows me to use the oven vent when I release pressure.

The pot does pressure cook really quickly which means you can cook faster and don't have to leave a crock pot cooking all day.

Liquid amount while cutting down recipe size is one of the biggest. I did read to start with the minimum amount of liquid and then work your way up, if needed, while learning. First time we used it my husband made a rookie mistake of pushing the start delay button after entering the cooking time which led to some frustration. He always says to me RT%M, but yet, here was a fail on his part even though he claimed to have read it. Once we moved past that road block though everything else went smoothly. Our first recipe was Indian Butter Chicken. A fork cut through the chicken just like butter. Next mashed potatoes which required a guess about liquid since we used less than 2lbs of potatoes instead of 5 lbs like the recipe called for. They turned out good, but a little wet, but as promised there were no lumps, very smooth, perfectly tender potatoes. I wished I had started with the minimum rule on the liquid as that probably would of been enough.We placed a dish drying mat underneath it to collect any water that would collect on the surface. Also decided to buy some microfiber towels to clean it after use. It cleans up very easily. The tough part was getting the anti-block shield to pop off, probably drying it first would help to get a grip on it. The sealing ring was easy to take off and on simply by pulling up and then pushing it back in after it is cleaned and dried. I think buying another sealing ring as a back up would be a good idea as I have the feeling it will be the first thing that needs to be replaced.This is a great buy for people who have busy lives and still want good, fast, and healthy food.

It needs a Tupperware seal lid so you can store it in the fridge for the week if you're not meal prepping in separate containers. Super convenient as is and very fast and no thinking or planning. Just chop and throw in the pot. It cooks very quickly and keeps the food hot/ready to eat for 10 hours so after you cook it stays fresh off the fire hot for the rest of the day.

At first I was skeptical but it did not disappoint me at all.  It is true that you may have to cook longer like 30 min. if you want chicken or roast beef to be really tender or to make meat to be shredded.  But it does work well and it is very efficient for people who have not much time.  It turned out to be that you can make various cooked meal with left over vegetables with frozen chicken or beef that you can put them in the pot to cook together within short time period.  With less oil and less amount of sodium, you can make various dishes easily.  I wanted to choose 3Qt instead of 6 Qt to make it smaller, which is also the best choice.

Then I receive an email from a different rep that unfortunately they don’t ship for free to Hawaii. Uhm Amazon sure did. I asked what the shipping charge would be. The response 126.00 lol but luckily for me they would pay 50 % so for the rock bottom price of nearly 70.00 they would replace my 99.00 purchase that broke because of an acknowledged manufacturing failure . How generous . I like the instant pot but be aware that if you are in Hawaii or Alaska and yours breaks this will happen to you.

There are many glowing reviews, but their content boils down to ""it cooks faster"".So? When we make mashed potatoes or soak garbanzo beans for falafel, it isn't as if we spend our day hovering over the pot. We get on with our day while the water does its work.Cutting to the chase, I was wrong. Yes, this and all pressure cookers primarily just cook faster, but it is surprising how much that changes the game. Many foods no longer require planning. You can start cooking when hungry. You can cook dinner at dinner time rather than starting hours earlier.I just steamed 11 uncut potatoes (to be mashed) in 15 minutes! When making baby food, I steamed carrots and broccoli in 3 minutes of cook time!Some specific observations:- Cook times listed in various recipes do not include warm-up time and depressurization time.This isn't as significant as it sounds. The Instant Pot requires very little water to do its work, so it heats surprisingly quickly. I haven't timed it, but starting with cold tap water, it seems to take 1-5 minutes depending on the amount.- Depressurization is very easy and safe, but loud. The steam shooting out of the vent isn't particularly hot, nor is it particularly flush with moisture. On our first use, I was concerned that what appeared to be a large volume of steam would collect on the cabinets, but after a few seconds they were dry. I have no concerns about accidental steam burns because it just isn't hot enough to burn before your body can respond. I suspect the vent somehow mixes outgoing steam with cool air from the room.- Clean-up is very easy. We rarely use our food processor because there are so many parts to clean -- it's usually overall faster to chop small batches by hand. With the Instant Pot, we have only had to clean the stainless steel bowl that ships with the unit. It is dishwasher-safe, unlike many plastic food processor parts which get cloudy and brittle after repeated washes in hot detergent water, and it is surprisingly easy to clean by hand. Because of the way the cooker works, many recipes are such that food doesn't burn onto the metal surface.",I did not believe I would use the Instant Pot very often.

Instructions are still not clear even though I can tell they have improved it from the reviews of the earlier InstantPots. Thank God for bloggers!! I may have never used my InstantPot if it were not for bloggers sharing information and recipes.  I have made chili, chicken zuch noodle soup, chicken tiki masala, orange chicken and rice. Everything has turned out great. Make sure you have all the ingredients cut and ready to go bc the saute' is very hot and you need to add ingredients quickly and stir so it doesn't burn. I'm not really sure if it has saved me time cooking but I think it may be due to fact I am making complicated dishes that I don't normally make. I bought this so my husband could make chicken quickly before work but there's still heat up time, steam release time and the actual cooking time. So yes, it may only take 15 min to cook frozen chicken but you should add about another 20 min on top of that. So he does not use it. Since this is a newer version some of the recipe instructions from bloggers may not match. But you figure it out. I use the cancel button a lot trying to figure it out and also when the saute is just too hot and it needs to cool down. I haven't made a cake yet bc I need to buy another ring. Yes, the rings keep the smell of the food you cook. I think I should have just bought the cheaper one anyways bc I don't think I will really use the other options. So far my favorite recipe is the copycat recipe for Wendy's chili.
