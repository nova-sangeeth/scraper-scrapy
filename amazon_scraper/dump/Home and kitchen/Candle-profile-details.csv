It reminded me of the car air fresheners of old that people used to hang on their rear view mirrors.  It is much too strong - and not really the mild pine scent I had anticipated.

The one I got just was not very powerful.I am not sure if these are just very old stock, or perhaps seconds. Normally, these fill the room with their wonderful scents. With the one I received, you can tell a candle is burning, but you'd never guess the scent (either while burning or after extinguishing it). Very different from my other YC items.So, just know that the price is great, but it might not be a bargain.

The smell was non-existent. I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don’t realize people aren’t as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren’t as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that’s a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends “wake up” and go “your right, their candles just aren’t that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.” It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks.I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone’s favorite,  have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I’m not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don’t respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when “customers come FIRST”? They’re gone and now it’s only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that’s destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets.",Yankee Candles just aren’t any good anymore.,Size: Large JarStyle: MistletoePattern Name: CandleVerified Purchase,10 people found this helpful

I chose this scent specifically because people claimed it was one of their stronger offerings. It seemed fine at the start, but once I got about 1/3rd into the jar, the scent pretty much went away completely unless I was standing directly on top of the candle while it was lit. It's pretty disappointing to see such a drop in overall quality. What good is having high burn time in a large jar when you pretty much smell nothing 80% of the time it's lit?
