However due to my increasingly demanding clinical site work, I’ve upgraded my shoes to the Adidas Ultraboost 19. My school requires white shoes (I’ve been able to get away with the pale blue Cloud foams because like Shawshank Redemption, people tend to not look at other’s shoes). The Ultraboost are considerably more at about $180 MSRP. But they come with a ton more springiness and you can tell you are getting much more in a shoe. They are very forgiving to feet that swell over a long day so I recommend to try those if you’re in the market for something nicer.Side note: I hear Nike is coming out with a shoe line specifically geared towards healthcare workers and shift work. Excited to give those a shot down the line but for now I am happy wearing both my cloud foams and ultraboostsSizing.. not sure how my feet shrank over the last 20 years but they have gone down from. 7.5-8 to a 5.5. Pretty soon i’ll be wearing baby shoes. In these particular shoes for my feet (knowing it varies for people) I’d say they’re a good fit maybe slightly roomy which works well since I wear thick compression socks since I am in nursing school. The 10-12 hours in the hospital make it so my feet swell. So I would recommend getting your normal size.I have these shoes in both grey and pale blue. Although I agree “cloud foam” makes it sound like you’re stepping onto a memory foam mattress and it enveloping and caressing your tired feet.. it has much less padding than anticipated. However, these are THE most comfortable shoes I have owned in quite some time.I have several pairs of Nike Free which are also comfy in their own right but I am finding my feet are getting slightly wider as I age (yay) I am in my 30’s if that helps any reader.The huge plus in these are that the raised and padded heel makes it so I never ever get blisters there. And i always get blisters there.The only thing i’m not crazy about is the tongue portion. The top of it hits the same area of my foot so I can’t sport ankle socks. It’s ok for me since I am always wearing them in scrubs under long pants.I’ve worn my grey pair on 4 hour hikes, 8 hours in an amusement park and every time these do not make me feel like I have bound feet.The price for a big name brand is really reasonable at $55.

I can confidently say that these are not knockoffs. Every minor detail, from the box, to the tag, to the shoe itself, is identical. Even the paper inside the box is the same (imprinted with Adidas logo). Shoe construction is the same, the memory foam insert feels the same to the touch and also when tried on. Knockoffs always cut corners somewhere, whether it be the material, construction, or packing materials (box and paper), and there are no corners cut here. The only slight difference I was able to discern was that the ones from Adidas have a slightly harder and more bright white sole, but the Adidas pair is a year newer per the copyright on the bottom of the box, so it makes sense that the company may have updated the sole slightly to make it more durable from last year’s model.In my pictures, the Adidas pair is on the left and the Amazon pair is on the right.Sizing: I am a solid 8.5 with a more narrow foot. Because I have read that Adidas run large, I bought these in an 8. They are not long enough, and they are also not nearly as wide as my Adidas PureBoost sneakers. They are a more narrow cut and fit true to size. Unfortunately, Amazon is currently sold out of 8.5, so I had to return these.

I really wanted a slip on sneaker to walk my dog but still wanted decent support. I didn’t realize until they arrived that they are all one piece. The higher back allows for you to hold them while slipping your foot in. The laces are functional in the sense that they can make the shoe tighter if your foot is very narrow but it’s really not needed.Fit: I usually wear a 7 or 7.5 and bought size 7. They fit perfectly but with no room to spare. A 7.5 would be too large for sure.Width: These are a very narrow shoe. I’ve included a picture compared to my adidas boost running sneakers.Function: NOT for running. These are a walking or fashion sneaker. I was surprised after receiving that other reviewers mentioned getting injured after running in these because the minute you take them out of the box you should know they aren’t suitable for that. I walk 3 miles 2-3 times a week and wear these to work pretty often. They work perfectly for that kind of wear but not a high impact activity like running.Comfort: They are extremely comfortable and very light weight. The fabric is breathable.Cons: The sole creases in the middle after only a couple wears. They run narrow and might not fit a wider foot. The bottom scuffs away pretty easy and so I think that will be the first part to wear down making them unwearable. I would still buy another pair regardless of these things.Pros: They look good, feel good and are incredibly functional and versatile. The slip on style is great for people who just don’t want to tie their shoes (you know who you are!) and the branding isn’t in your face slapped all over the shoe.10/10 would recommend and as soon as I can afford it I’ll be buying a 2nd pair",This is a slip on...

Answer: NO. They are not fake. They are legitimate Adidas Cloudform Pure shoes. I bought two pairs of these shoes from the seller Amazon, manufacture Adidas - one black, one white. When I first got them, they felt a little tighter than I remember my identical old pair being. I read the reviews, and I got real paranoid about them being counterfeit bc the material felt different and also they didn’t come with an extra pair of laces or one of those spongy-feeling metal ball key chain things that came attached to the lace hole of my previous pair. So. I called Adidas customer service and talked to a customer support person who authenticated these shoes for me. Both pairs are 100% legit. So don’t be worried about buying fake shoes. The most important thing is to look at the serial numbers on the tags on the inside of the shoe. If the serial numbers are the same, they are fake. If left and right are different, they are legitimate.Ok let get to the actual review.My feet look like Fred Flintstone got genetically double whammied with bunions.  I’ve had two surgeries on each foot, and they are still bad. But these shoes are good for these boats, and lemme tell ya why:First, let’s talk material. These shoes are stretchy like maybe a little tight at the top at first, but just wear em inside for a few hours, and they will loosen up. The sole is literally made of clouds, I don’t know how they do it. They are so lightweight and although it doesn’t say non-slip, the traction on them is pretty great.Now the design on these babies is pretty tailored to me in particular (thanks adidas!) for some reason they included non-functional shoe laces, but the shoe laces break up the shoe in a way that makes them look not so big. I can’t stand a slip on, because a size 11 slip on clearly makes it look like I’m standing in two giant canoes. And something about those goofy loops on the top of the “tongue” (the tongue is fixed) and top of the heel do something to make it look more... flirty? Idk, but the loops make me feel all fancy.Now... the most important: comfort. Ohhhhh so comfy!! Very light-weight. No pinching anywhere. None of the seams rub weird. I usually get blisters somewhere on new shoes at first, I expected it, but no pain, no blisters. Perfect fit.If you have finicky feet, give these shoes a try. They look nice, even on big feet. They feel nice, even with bunions.",Adidas authenticated - not fake. Also good for bunions and wide feet.,Size: 11Color: Black/Grey/GreyVerified Purchase,9 people found this helpful

Like, from Torrid an 11 falls off of me because they think everyone has wide feet and calves, and at Kohl's an 11 women's shoe doesn't even fit halfway up my foot. So, I ordered an 11 because that's the highest size they had and it. fits. perfectly. In the first photo the back of one shoe looks to be gapping but that's because of the way my heel was sitting. They feel lighter than air. If you need a shoe that feels super comfortable on your foot but weighs the amount of a feather, buy these shoes. The second photo is posted to show that they look a little narrow. I personally love this because my feet are on the narrower side.

I wore this to work and by the 6th hour, I was limping because both my feet HURT. Even in the pictures, you can see that the part with the stitches dips in and makes the shoes narrower in that area. My feet were red and swollen by the time I took off the shoes. Knowing how uncomfortable they were, I wasn't willing to keep them.These are also walking shoes so if you're looking for support for plantar fascitis, this pair is not for you. With how narrow they are, one would probably have to size up at least one full size to be able to fit both inserts and your foot in.","Very narrow, uncomfortable pair of shoes.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

Instead, I want to compliment and share my experience with the most ridiculously simple online return process in which I’ve ever taken part in.So, before I brag about how easy this was, here are the details-...last weekend, I ordered a (different) pair of Adidas (A1)...only to realize upon receipt that I completely and totally overlooked the fact that they were made in wide-fit sizes ONLY! (I thought the title mention of “wide” was simply stating that wide-fit was an OPTION in with A1,and not the rule; the typical “W” noted after the shoe size {American sizes anyway}- i.e. “8.5W”-would usually be displayed in the size drop-down menu, thus identifying the fit of each pair! Basically- No “W”? Regular fit. Yes “W”? Wide fit.)So when I received A1 and saw how big they were I was so disappointed, as I’ve been looking forward to receiving them for quite awhile now. The style for which this particular review is being posted- A2- was actually my second choice, thus my go-to when A1 didn’t exactly work out and I needed to determine an exchange. This process was INCREDIBLY SIMPLE! While I’m definitely thrilled with A2’s style+fit, I’m so so so much more than satisfied with the swap process as well. I simply specified the parameters of my return - options include: return A1 for refund, only exchange A1 for a different size in the same style, or exchange A1 for a totally different item (with the under/over $ amounts simply being charged or refunded). I selected the latter option of exchanging A1 for a pair of similarly priced A2s and was then given return instructions for the A1s. I assumed that, upon receipt of the returned pair, they would then get the A2s sent out; however, after processing the exchange on Amazon on Wednesday (6/10), I’ve actually just today (Friday 6/12) already received the new pair before even having the opportunity to get to post office to send back the pair originally ordered A1s.Excellent turn around. Simple process.Why must you be so amazing, Amazon?! The ease in which everything is done and the amazing convenience means I’m on here spending/ordering far more often than I really need to be haha but in all seriousness, I’m thoroughly satisfied and so pleased with every aspect of this transaction.

Where the tips of my toes are, it feels like there is no padding, so seems like it's not around the edges. Maybe that's intentional, but it feels a little strange to me. Also, my feet tend to sweat (especially with the 90 and humid days we've been having), and about 3/4 of the way through my walks it starts to feel like the cloadfoam is starting to get wet/squishy, almost as if rain water leaked into the shoe. I don't think they are actually ""wet"", just feels like it. So, they are fine walking shoes (I don't think running in them would be a good idea), but not worth the current price ($60-80??!)

The shoe is extremely lightweight and has a thin layer of foam which was hardly noticeable in the ball of the foot. This could be seen as an pro as a light weight shoe for traveling or casual wear.  I bought these hoping for a cushy running shoe, but did not use for running because the padding was so thin on the sole compared to my Nikes and Brooks.  Heel did have padding, but still very light on the padding compared to a traditional “running shoe.” Ball of foot and toe area, little padding.  I run anywhere between 1.5-4 miles 3-5 times per week and will also walk 1-2 miles on other days. The shoe provided more than adequate comfort for walking several miles and did well while walking miles upon miles in Europe. I did not have sore feet! So style was perfect, but comfort for any running activity beyond extensive walking may require a more heavily padded shoe especially if you desire arch support. I did use with arch supports in Europe and found the shoe to be a complete success in meeting my needs for 50miles if walking in 5 days.

These are great because the sides are so low but not worth it if the rest of my feet hurt because the shoe is no good.A week later- these dang things have a tongue on the top of the shoe that, after a while feels like a cat tongue on your ankle at the top.

They can be worn for running, weight lifting, other exercising, or just as everyday shoes; however, I purchased them for everyday wear. I am a college student who walks to class every day. These shoes have been perfect for that. My feet have not hurt one bit. I chose the black and white speckled colored ones to accommodate for comfortable, lazy-day outfits, or cute outfits with jeans! Neutrals are always a go-to in my opinion, because I am definitely one to want to get as much use out of a product as possible. This shoe wipes clean and doesn’t stain which is amazing! I was worried living in Iowa, with heavy snow and rain, that the shoe would be destroyed quite quickly. I was surprised to see how easily they wipe clean.The Cloudfoam midsole and outsole are combined for step-in comfort and superior cushioning and the sock liner molds to hug the foot as well for extra support. I personally like the high ankle as it gives more stability. The Cloudfoam pure running shoes are super comfortable and lightweight and the fabric is a very breathable mesh. I appreciate that my feet do not sweat when I wear these shoes because of how breathable they are. I love the slick and clean look and that it feels like I am running on air, yet have plenty of support. They are super cute and come exactly as pictured.The shoes seem to run a half-size big, so I would keep that in mind when purchasing or prepare to wear a little bit of a thicker sock and/or purchase an insole for the shoes. These shoes are more of a slip on shoe. There are laces on the shoe, but there is no tongue, so slipping the shoe on and off can be done quite easily. With that being said, you can pull the laces a little tighter if needed.I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good tennis shoe, hence why I rated these shoes four out of five stars!

I have a high arch, so I have trouble sometimes finding shoes that really give me support. After COVID, my job changed and I went from a mostly desk job to a job where I was on my feet every day in a more physical environment, so I had to buy new sneakers after realizing how much my old ones were making my feet hurt. This review is actually for my second pair. The first pair I bought were white and I have worn them almost daily for a year. I bought a black pair just because they wouldn't show dirt quite as much. My white pair still have great support. PROS: great arch support, comfortable memory foam, pull on where you don't have to tie them- because I'm lazy- but they do have ties so it looks like regular tennis shoes, and they're washable (at least I washed my white pair and they looked great afterwards).... CONS: Don't know if I would want to run or do some hard exercising in these because they don't actually tie to get tight.

I just got these Adidas Cloudfoam Pure shoes and they are definitely too small! I wear a standard 7.5 and my toes are all at the top of the shoe. Maybe because of the soft woven fabric and low profile toe trim, it isn’t as noticeable to folks and they think the size is alright. In ANY OTHER athletic shoe or sneaker such as this pair, it would be painful. Not to mention wear out the woven material at my toe are very quickly if I kept them and wore them. I will return them and consider a half-size up; the lack of any arch support whatsoever may be a deal breaker for me between my knees and feet.I can say that the comfort of the woven portion around your foot is extremely comfortable. Just what I was looking for in a quick slip on sneaker to head on light errands or a very light walk with the dogs in the neighborhood. Pay attention when you order them - they are not intended to be anything more than that... they are not for running or taking out on the trail even for a light day hike!!!Three stars for comfort and being a lightweight shoe built for light duty (I’d do a 2.5, but don’t have that option).

The memory foam on the inside is so comfy and none of my previous sneakers have had arch support this good. I lile that it isnt too chunky under the heel so they could be used for some lifting as well. Size as expected. Feet dont get too hot with the memory foam insoles because the fabric of the shoe is so breathable and light weight. 10/10 would recommend,Buying in more colors! Arch support is great,Size: 7Color: White/White/BlackVerified Purchase,

After reading the reviews I learned that they run a tad big. I wanted them to be a little lose because I'll be working in them and I don't like when they're tight on my toes. I ordered my regular size (7) and they're exactly the fit I was wanting! Just a little lose around my toes and perfect everywhere else. They're very comforting.

I have been wearing them for a week now and LOVE THEM. They do run a little large but I am doing fine in my normal size. These are super lightweight so if you like support these are probably not the best shoes for you. I am on my feet at work a ton and haven't had the foot pain I had in my last tennis shoes (asics).
