I have one 8 pair set of these and 2 pair of the comparable asics running socks that I bought at the same time. The asics are holding up slightly better as these saucony socks are starting to look their age after repeated washings. But! For the price (and the 8 saucony and 2 asics pairs cost the same) they are amazing. No holes, no unraveling, no stretching or shrinking. I've gone through 2 pairs of running shoes in that time. I do between 5k and 8k a day (3-5 miles) 6 days a week on a trail or treadmill, plus the regular movement of life. That's a LOT of abuse and these have held up very well. I will keep an eye on asics for a great sale, but I will be purchasing more of these!ORIGINAL  REVIEW:I wear a size 9 women's athletic shoe and these fit perfectly. They're tight but not small, don't slide down when I run, absorb moisture but still breathe, and are form fitting with the light compression at the arch.I would compare them to asics socks of the same design, but at half the price.

I wear a women's shoe size 11EE. I also have very thick ankles and calves. Although most socks companies claim to fit sizes 6-9 & 8-12, the fact seems to be that they simply relabeled socks and didn't change the sizes. So what used to be labeled as 8-10 is now 8-12, but the fit for me is no different. They're still too small. In addition, most socks are too tight in the calf for me.So, I decided to try these Saucony socks. They listed more sizing options, and being ""no show"" socks I wasn't worried about the calf width. I did have concerns about how they would fit on my ankles and whether they would stay up. I tried ""no show"" socks a few years back and they kept slipping down my heel.I am ecstatic (small things in life can bring joy) to say that these socks are great! They're soft and comfortable on my feet. They reach all the way to my heels and still give my toes plenty of wiggle room. The tab on the back of the sock is handy when pulling on the socks. And I've had no problem with the socks slipping down into my shoes. The socks do leave a little bit of an elastic mark at the base of my ankle, but it doesn't feel tight at all.
