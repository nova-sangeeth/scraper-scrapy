"Authentic and Beautiful, Love these way more than ever expected",J.G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Everyone is posting that there isn’t a difference between these and the 1st gen.  This is misleading and inaccurate.  Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement.  The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing.  This isn’t anecdotal.  It’s been tested and proven to be faster.","4,678 people found this helpful",Verified Purchase,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2019"

Great headphone,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These AirPods are amazing they automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.",859 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2019"

  Looks like Otterbox just isn't what it used to be.  Premium priced cases are now made in CHINA and the quality isn't even close to what they used to be. Didn't fit well or feel good in hand. Sent  both a Commuter and an Otterbox Defender back this week.  The Defender's holster clip would not hold the latch in the kickstand position and would click off and the phone would fall over setting on a desk every time ........And this was new, right out of the box.  Sad situation. Called Otterbox ,  no warranty since I had bought it on the internet !

NOT A GOOD CASE,AnnieInAcworth,2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I was completely shocked that my camera lens fractured when the phone was dropped being properly installed in this otter box.  My previous otter box protected my iPhone 6 for four years.  Even made it thru a rollover car accident.  I’m speechless about the failure of this new otter box.

Bixby voice wake-up
",Eddie boy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I don't usually write reviews, or bother others with my thoughts on things, but since Samsung had such a chance to hit a home run with these, but boy did they miss, I figured I'd help others who were looking for the same things I was in these. I listen to mostly podcasts, so the lackluster sound quality is ok, I can deal with that in, but the idea that irks me is the poor sound quality these have all around, not just in podcasts or music. I hate to hold a phone when talking on it, and everyone I have spoken to on these has been disappointed with how I sound to them (sounds like I'm an in a tinny room with lots of echoes), along with my disappointment in the sound quality of those on the other end as well.

Awesome Quality at Great Price,J Davis KY,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm one of the very, very few people who cannot use the apple air pods. No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!","2,161 people found this helpful","

Samsung Galaxy S7 Approved!!!,Rik Hanssen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pretty disappointed. It hasn't even been 6 months, and one of the ports don't charge anymore. TBH, after doing some review reading, I was excited about this charger.  I bought one for myself and one for my friend. I'm not sure how his is doing or how often he uses it (I don't think that should matter regarding the ports, I can understand if the battery dies over time....hopefully not a short amount of time).  I usually use it over the weekends, and took it on another weekend trip to find my self short a charging port. Definitely annoyed!","4,513 people found this helpful",Verified Purchase,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2016"

Great product initially but one port stopped working after 3 months,Shab,1.0 out of 5 stars,"EDiT 2/16/17: Anker's customer service is second to none! The replacement works as it should, but the wire would not charge the PowerCore.  After contacting their customer service team again, they were happy to replace the faulty wire sent with the replacement PowerCore. Great company that cares about their customers. I just wish products nowadays lasted longer, but regardless, I'll be buying their products again.
