Superb,Sumit Kukade,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Okay. So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.",943 people found this helpful,Verified Purchase,Reviewed in India on 2 August 2019
"Finally, got my Mac !!!!",ba_doh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)","1,179 people found this helpful","

DEAD after 1 year two months...,Shantanu Bangar,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.",366 people found this helpful,Newest,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2018

MacBook motherboard and battery collapsed.,saurabh chauhan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to ""buy"" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.",118 people found this helpful,Newest,Reviewed in India on 8 February 2019

  Don't buy for the pride or quality advertised. The lapot keyboard failed just 2 days after the warrenty period. Service cost was 19,000. So I backed out and was using a USB keyboard. Now the whole system is not switching On. Took to local service center it has costed me 3,500 to just make it work again and still will cost more to make the keyboard replaced. Truly gutted. I have my HP laptop pro book almost 9 years old still running without any issues. Was planning to buy an IPhone but surely not after this. Deeply sad by the experience.

  General observation, Do not buy expensive electronics from Amazon as thy have no quality control in place/checks on their vendors. Mostly, vendors pass on defective items to customers. It is true across categories.

  I was apprehensive of buying Apple product from Amazon as some reviews suggested that imported items are being sold. However what I got was fresh and genuine product, I checked warranty on Apple site with serial no. All serial no - on bill, box, inner box and in macOS itself were consistent. Display is too good and it feels like butter operating the device. Only thing is that price difference between this and 256GB version is too much.

MACBOOK AIR REVIEW,Sumit Kukade,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I bought two pieces of this , because I really heard good comments about it but unfortunately just after the 2nd year both of them have faced problems, one faced mother board problem and another one screen problem. I am sorry but if your looking for long lasting laptops then don’t buy this model. It’s waste of money. This model of Apple is not good at all.

  Everything about this product seems to be fine as of now. Got an option to upgrade to higher OS and install tools required for my work. Except for not so good sound quality while watching movies through itunes stores, other aspect seems to be fine. Higher storage options (256 GB) may be required for power users who may want to app development on this system. Current configuration suits light - medium heavy user(I belong to this category)- (need xcode debugging feature for my projects ).

  It's the best investment I have made. I would have regret if would have bought a windows laptop instead. You have to just compromise with the screen quality. But what else you get worths buying this. Best performance in this price, best battery life in any laptop in this price range or this may be better than other expensive windows laptops, you get the best build quality and a reliable and secure OS i.e macOS. Guys, if you can afford this, please ignore windows laptop, only if you can compromise with screen quality. You may get better screen quality in the cheapest windows laptops, but everything else, won't be worth compromising. I bet you..Get it today..!

  If you want to go for a MacBook but don't have the budget for a pro or if your requirements are very basic like browsing, entertainment, and other normal tasks then just go for it. It is better than any other laptop at this price range. I am using it for the past two years but no issues whatsoever, a windows laptop would have given lots of issues by now.
