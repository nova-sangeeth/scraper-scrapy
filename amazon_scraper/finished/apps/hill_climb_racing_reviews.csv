I never noticed it or played it until we got Fire TV. I personally, hardly ever play ANY games on the tv or xbox or things like that. I have played apps on my kindle and on my computer with FB and stuff but not really a gamer person overall. Anyway, I saw this app when installing the Fire TV and just got it quickly so I could try it out and see if I had everything set up right, etc. It ended up that my son, my husband and even I, sat and played this particular app for hours! We did not even check the rest of the things like movies and stuff to see if they were set up and working thru the FIre tv thing yet because once we started this, we just kept on. I do think it was very entertaining to the family because they had never really saw me play before and it was fun for all of us to find something we liked together. So, it may not be for everyone but it was easy for me ( an older woman not much on gadgets), and it was easy to follow the ""storyline"". It is simple and does have music and sounds but not really annoying. Anyway, I think people should try it out and just have a little amusing fun here and there and this will do it.",I really like this app. Works great on Fire TV.,Verified Purchase,15 people found this helpful,,393,386,108816,Public

They did a superb job taking a simple concept and making it fun with a high replay value. I play a few rounds each day  and find it entertaining. They vary the performance of the vehicles and the stages very well! I love using the motorcycle on the moon! They did an exceptional job having the vehicles respond to the upgrades you install. Some games you can never see any change but with this game you can tell a huge difference when you upgrade your engine, tires etc. I found that there is enough rewards earned in the game to keep the upgrades coming and I have not had to make an in-app purchase.",Best game app by far - simple and addicting,Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,,156,94,1646853,Public

Seems beyond simple and basic while still providing a challenge. My son loves this game. But really it is great for any age because my son and his dad have logged many hours playing this game together and separately. It is perfect to help time pass by. Other than being free another great benefit of this game is that it has no need for internet. Another great thing about is game is that the more you play the game the further along in the game you get by earning points and upgrading your buggy. At this point they have kept adding different things to the game so it is almost never ending (for us at least). Ultimately, be careful because this game really is addicting. Besides the fact that it is free and it doesn't drain your battery unlike some other games. We have this game on Android phone and Kindle Fire and have had no problems at all with crashes or freezing. Prepare to spend more time than you expect riding the dune buggy threw a virtual world.

I get tired of having to go over the same scenes time after time. Even after you've cleared a level you start back at the beginning. So, when you've gone, say 1000m, and you kill the driver, you have to go back to the beginning, no matter what level you are on.I also cannot see that upgrading makes any changes except to the engine. Suspension, tires, AWD, nothing is changed as you upgrade. Further, there is no variability of the brakes or gas; it's either full-on or full-off.Finally, there is NO explanation or instruction. The player is just left to figure it out for themselves.  I'm not taken by this game and only play it when I tire of the other stuff I've been doing.",Hill Climb racing,Verified Purchase,,,54,97,5456524,Public

You choose a vehicle, you choose a ""track"", and away you go, trying to drive as far as you can, maneuvering over and through various obstacles.  I particularly like driving in the moon track with a powerful vehicle, doing tons of flips in the zero gravity environment.  It's fun to unlock new vehicles and tracks, and to upgrade each vehicle for better speed and handling is satisfying.  My only wish for this game is that the upgrading could happen a little faster.  Otherwise, I recommend this game.",Fun Game that is easy to play,Verified Purchase,,,,,356469,
