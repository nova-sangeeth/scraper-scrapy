I frequently have to give up a lot of the award since I just don't have that kind of time to be playing.  Seriously, I won 6 continuous hours of unlimited lives!  Who has that kind of time to spend on a game?  It would also be nice to be able to buy just a single extra move, rather than always five, and for such a ridiculous amount.  You would have to win 18 regular game levels to earn enough coins to pay for those five moves, which is also the same amount of coins it costs to buy an additional five lives.","Fun game, but I wish I could change a couple things",Verified Purchase,14 people found this helpful,98,22,Public,1874877
