Who are all these 5 star reviewers?  The writing was boring, the characters flat, it was repetitive, contrived.. The author created suspense by basically not telling you anything forEVER.  And the daughter whom the protagonist, Hannah, was to protect?  Complete brat.  She was just miserable ALL THE TIME and yet, Hannah, to the point of obsequiousness, is constantly trying to win her over and every page has some melodramatic prose about her heart breaking wide open or being thrilled with the slightest act of grace from the obnoxious brat in need of protection.  Why was daughter so entitled to be miserable and rude while being raised by doting dad in Sausalito of all places?  Dad just shrugs, Hannah tries harder because she is, IDK, spineless? But wait until you get to the part where we find out what daughter is being protected from! It's so absurd, so implausible that hurling book at wall seemed reasonable.  Hannah is just a constant pillar of deep introspection and moral superiority. She's going to devote her whole life to said brat.  Also, Grady, the US Marshall character?  No! No, he would not have spent over a decade personally invested in the life of the son-in-law of an ex con and he most certainly wouldn't have worn a baseball cap on backwards in every appearance he makes in the novel.  What grown man in law enforcement walks around in his professional life with a baseball cap on backwards?  Was that supposed to be charming?  Because I see that backwards cap on any man's head and I want to knock it the heck off.The only pleasure I got out of this book is the cathartic experience I'm having writing this review and arriving at the sound decision of never buying a Reese Witherspoon book club pick again.  And if she produces or stars in the film or series version, I'll never forgive her or watch Walk the Line again for like the 12th time.",Did Reese really read this book?

You know the one. Right from the start, the narrator has a rhythm that pulls you in, the words flow so smoothly that you almost forget you’re reading. It’s like someone is reading to you. While you’re not sure if the storyteller is reliable or where the story is going, that’s all part of the intrigue. On the surface, things seem sweet. But there is an air of mystery. Now you’re hooked.Hannah is in love. With Owen. She picked up her life and moved across the country from Manhattan to Sausalito to be with him, where he is settled in with his now teenage daughter, Bailey, who is not looking to replace her deceased mother. Cue the snarky comments and eye rolls that only a 16-year-old can deliver with aplomb to the awaiting stepmother. But Hannah is not rattled. She is patient, having lost her own mother, albeit in a different way.Dependable Owen doesn’t come home from his job as an engineer at a software startup. Instead, he sends a young girl to his house to hand deliver a cryptic two-word message to his wife. Baffled, frightened and unsure of what to do, Hannah is determined to find out where her husband is, after word is out that the company is being charged with securities fraud, which leads her to take matters into her own hands on the streets of Austin.I especially liked this thriller for its well-paced plot, well-developed not too far-fetched with just the right amount of intrigue characters, each of whom is faced with a decision about which treacherous path to take.​THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME is an engrossing tale of suspense and family drama with female characters who are doing it for themselves.","Well-paced, suspenseful family drama!",Verified Purchase,88 people found this helpful,,10522,724,Public,304

It was a fast read and in the beginning an interesting story. The characters were never fully fleshed out and as the book progressed their actions became more and more implausible. I have to say that I personally do not care for book/movies where female characters rush headlong into dangerous situations without pause or thought for the possible impact on all concerned, the kind of thing that happens often on Hallmark mysteries. I would like to think that strong female characters use their brains and logic to solve problems in a way that has the best outcome for the most people without martyrdom/stupid heroics on their part. The ending was a real letdown, not at all realistic, it would never happen that way in the real world. There are too many questions left unanswered and too many loose threads.

The underlying premise of the book is that the main character Hannah will do anything to protect her stepdaughter Bailey.  She's only been married to Owen for 2-years, and Owen's surly teenager Bailey has yet to accept Hannah.  Owen then disappears, and he leaves Hannah a note saying ""Protect her."".  Nothing else.  Honestly, if I was in Hannah's shoes, I'd be pretty pissed with my husband for bailing and leaving me to raise his daughter.  At the end of the book, Hannah decides to not go into witness protection program with Bailey and be reunited with Owen because she doesn't trust that the witness protection program will be able to in fact protect them.  So she decides to continue her life with Bailey by brokering a peace deal with Bailey's grandfather.  Overall, I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't buy into the plot line.  Hannah effortlessly falls in love with caring for this surly teenage girl, but there is no underlying reason other than she is Owen's step daughter.  It seems farfetched that Hannah would makes the decision to sacrifice ever seeing her husband again because that is what is best for Bailey, and she is left to raise Bailey as a single mom.  I just can't buy into the belief that Hannah actually loves Bailey in the all consuming selfless manner the author presents.  It's just not realistic.","Meh.

The bulk of the story involves the main character making odd gut-decisions for no reason. When everything finally culminates into a long drawn out ending full of emotional prose, I was left flabbergasted why she would choose one of the worst outcomes on purpose, and why the author couldn't have found a more creative way to wrap it all up.

It does but it is not overdone; instead there are enough twists and surprises to keep me turning the pages.It’s about Hannah Hill, a young woman who is a woodturner.  I was not completely sure of the definition. It is a person who shapes wood with a lathe.  Hannah creates rustic, beautiful pieces of furniture and other products.  She learned it from her grandfather who raised her; her mother abandoned Hannah.  The reader is introduced to her discipline, artistry and love for a grandparent.Hannah meets Owen when he visits her workshop.  He is a sharp, clever man who pursues and charms her and they marry.  He has one daughter, Bailey, that he adores and his purpose in life is to protect her.  Hannah works hard to endear Bailey to her; it is not easy.And then all trouble breaks loose.  Bailey finds a satchel in her school locker filled with money but her father is gone.  Hannah and Bailey are devastated.  The plot comes alive with the introduction of a cadre of people, some good, some bad, who are looking for Owen.  Neither Hannah or Bailey know where he is, which does protect them to a point. Although Hannah’s heart is breaking, she is determined to help sixteen-year-old Bailey and find her husband. The two are both sorrowful and frantic as they search, I’m not sure if they felt they were also victims.  It is a circumspect mystery with many secondary characters.  Some are extraneous and others drive the plot.The plot became somewhat complicated and I didn’t believe some pieces of the novel were connected.  There was high emotion in almost every scene and stimulating the story was a company called The Shop, that is accused of fraud and larceny. There were many accusations but Hannah and Bailey always felt that Owen loved them.  Despite the deep tragedies in this novel., superb characterization of the stepmother and stepdaughter is Dave’s strongest technique. The dialogue is finely tuned, Hannah is depicted as an overwrought stepmother trying very hard, and Bailey is a tough, beautiful, angry teen-ager that loves and misses her father.My gratitude to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for pre-published copy.

Hannah has left her life in New York City and moved into Owen’s house boat in Sausalito, Northern California, to start building a life together. Except there’s one problem. Owen’s sixteen year old daughter, Bailey, is not a fan of her new stepmother and she’s not afraid to make her feelings known. Hannah is desperate for some kind of connection with the teenager but no matter what she does, Bailey shows no sign of softening. And then Owen disappears leaving only a note: ‘PROTECT HER’. His boss is arrested for fraud and fingers are beginning to point in Owen’s direction. Hannah is repeatedly questioned about her husband’s whereabouts, but she knows nothing. Who is Owen really? Does Bailey’s childhood hold the key to figuring out where he’s vanished to? And how well do we really know the people we’re closest to…?The Last Thing He Told Me is a beautifully written mystery which captivates the reader from the start. Hannah and Owen live an almost idyllic existence and I was enchanted by their lives. I particularly liked Hannah who, despite her own parental traumas, seemed keen to be there for an uncommunicative and stroppy teen no matter what was thrown at  her. There are some wonderful moments of interaction between Hannah and Bailey scattered throughout the book, many of which gave me a warm glow. The return plane journey being one of my favourites.I loved that the book didn’t go in a direction I was expecting. The unravelling of Owen’s past was very compelling reading and I was always keen to return to the book and find out what juicy titbit Hannah and Bailey had discovered and how it would link to the next reveal. The suspense the author conveys is palpable and I was on the edge of my seat throughout, asking myself ‘who is this man and why would he leave his wife and daughter alone?’. All is revealed to the reader and it is completely unexpected.Would I recommend this book? I would, yes. If you’re looking for an intriguing mystery laden with bucket loads of suspense and family drama, The Last Thing He Told Me fits the bill perfectly. I was captivated by Hannah and Bailey’s hunt for the truth. It’s an emotional and beautifully written novel about sacrifice and what makes a parent.

I couldn’t put this one down. I was super impressed with The Last Thing He Told Me, Laura Dave’s latest novel, a mystery thriller that’s very different from her previous two contemporary romances—that I also loved.The story opens in Sausalito, California, the picturesque town on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge, but much of the novel is spent on the streets of Austin, Texas. I’ve been to Sausalito and I’ve been to Austin several times, and I don’t know if that’s what made this mystery even more intriguing for me, but it was fun recognizing the places and experiences the author described.From the first page, I liked Hannah, our straight-forward and sharp protagonist. Life has just thrown her the ultimate curve ball, but she trusts her instincts, putting her stepdaughter Bailey first. The flashbacks were well-placed and brief, rounding out her character and adding to the present-day tension. While I didn’t know where the plot would take me, I knew I could count on Hannah, which only made the story better, allowing me to settle back and enjoy the ride.I also didn’t expect how emotionally invested I would be in the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. Who needs romance?? This was the relationship that had me misty-eyed, reading late into the night. Every teenager needs a Hannah in their life.Mysteries and Thrillers are not my typical genres of choice. I’m usually underwhelmed by the twist, the denouement failing to compare to the rest of the book. But I was genuinely surprised by where this mystery led me. And while there were a few little things that raised my eyebrow, the author sold me on the delivery.The Last Thing He Told Me was a welcome surprise, and will probably end up being in the top of my favorite reads for 2021. I’m so excited it’s been optioned by Reese Witherspoon for Apple TV+ as a limited series staring Julia Roberts! This one will also make a great beach read or book club choice.

I enjoyed the characters and especially the relationship between Hannah and Bailey.Owen and Hannah were married only but a year when he doesn’t return home from work, instead she’s handed a note that says, “Protect her.”This kicks off the mystery about where Owen is, what he’s done and where that leaves Hannah and Bailey, who don’t get along, because Bailey hasn’t taken well to Hannah as a step-mom.Hannah takes us on an adventure, as she determined to find the truth about how both she and Hannah were dumped into this horrible mess.  Who really is Owen?  Did she really know him at all? Has their marriage been a sham from the beginning?  I think you will enjoy finding answers to these questions just as Hannah and Bailey.I enjoyed the ride we get by Hanna’s detective skills, ferreting truth from fiction and how one innocent comment led to a clue and on to the next.I thoroughly enjoyed this read, it’s ups and downs and an ending in which the author didn’t rush or get sloppy with. I’ll definitely be looking at Laura Dave’s other books.",Exciting Read,,One person found this helpful,,1042,704,Public,105192

Owen tells Hannah that his wife died in a car accident when his daughter Bailey was two years-old. He hasn’t had a serious relationship since and Bailey is now an angsty 16 year-old. Hannah uproots her New York life and moves into their houseboat in California. Now that’s love! Bailey, having only her Dad in her life, is no fan of Hannah. Two years into their waterfront life, Hannah receives a note from Owen that says “Protect Her.” He is Gone Boy! Hannah hears on the radio that his company, “The Shop” has just been indicted for securities fraud. Bailey and Hannah have no idea WTF is going on.

That’s the premise of this riveting story by Laura Dave.Hannah and Owen have been married a little over a year, living an idyllic life in a floating home in Sausalito with Owen’s 16-year-old daughter, Bailey.  The only wrinkle in Hannah’s happiness is her relationship with Bailey who, like many teens, isn’t too excited to have a stepmother. One day, a stranger deliver a cryptic note from Owen to Hannah with only two words: “Protect Her.” Hannah knows instantly that the “her” in this note refers to Bailey.  The note is otherwise a mystery – who does Bailey need to protected from, and why? That same day, Owen’s boss is arrested by the FBI for fraud and Owen disappears.Soon, the FBI and a US Marshal are interested in Owen’s disappearance too.  Why did Owen flee?  Is he involved in the fraud or is it something deeper?  Hannah comes to the realization that the man she loves is not who he seems to be, with a past neither she nor Bailey know anything about.  They embark on a path to uncover Owen’s secrets, which draws them closer together as they work to unravel his past.Let me just say – wow!  I have never read’s Laura Dave’s work before, but I could not put this book down and finished it in less than two days!  You might think – ho hum, just another corporate fraud tale, but no! This book is not just a mystery (although the mystery is engrossing and very well done) but also a domestic drama that explores the evolving relationship between Hannah and Bailey at the same time.  The development of their relationship is very moving and feels very authentic as Hannah protects Bailey and earns her trust.  The story is told in both the present and in flashbacks, which Dave does particularly well in this book.  “The Last Thing He Told Me” is twisty and emotional and I loved it!The epilogue lets us know how things pan out in the future.

Hannah has married Owen Michaels, Bailey’s father, and is seemingly living an idyllic life on a boat docked in Sausalito when one day Owen disappears. Like, poof! Owen’s boss at his tech company is arrested and Hannah is totally perplexed when her numerous calls to Owen’s phone go unanswered. She and Bailey set out to discover what happened to Owen and in their trip down the rabbit hole of secrets and lies, they slowly discover a relationship with each other. With lots of twists and turns, this was a book that was hard to put down and completely absorbing. The characters are well-developed and realistic, with Bailey’s character being one of a spoiled “daddy’s girl” who has to wake up to a new reality. Hannah is inventive in her quest to find out what happened to Owen and why he would leave his beloved daughter behind. Bailey seems to hold a lot of secrets that she doesn’t know she holds and it is up to Hannah to tease them out. This entire book was like being drawn further and further into a spider’s web and not knowing where I would end up. The plot was intricately and delicately woven around the non-relationship between Hannah and Bailey and the lies that Owen told each of them. I really enjoyed how the author depicted the growing dependency and relationship between the two and how Bailey’s view of her stepmother increasingly became one of trust instead of total resentment. The characters made this story, and the plot wasn’t far behind. Loved it! Fans of domestic suspense will not want to miss this one that will have you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next secret to be revealed.DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

I also didn't feel like what Owen left behind for reference made any sense or was helpful in anyway. Then when the story did come together, it was so uninteresting as a story arc or explanation for everything. There was so much build up around Nicholas and Charlie for the character to suddenly be able to ""negotiate"" with this supposedly dangerous person? There was so much stuff that was half explained or never explained. What was it that she felt Charlie had to say? What was the rest of the story about Owen we never heard?

It tests the bonds between father and daughter and husband and wife. I couldn't believe the sacrifices made in the name of love.Hannah and Owen have only been married two years and things are tense as Hannah tries to squeeze into a family that, since the death of his first wife many years ago, has just been Owen and his now 16-year old daughter, Bailey. There's nothing like a broody 16-year old to make things difficult. Things go even more awry when Owen suddenly disappears leaving Hannah only a cryptic note to protect Bailey. Then news hits that Owen's boss has been arrested on fraud charges and further arrests of high ranking officers, possibly including Owen, are imminent. Is that why Owen left? So he wouldn't be arrested? Hannah thinks there's more to his disappearance than that and she and Bailey form an uneasy alliance to find out why Owen has vanished. With the FBI and US Marshall Service after Owen, Hannah and Bailey are racing to find him first. What they uncover is not at all what they expected. Owen has secrets far more threatening than anything related to his work. They find that they don't really know the Owen he professed to be.This is a powerful book about family dynamics and love that made me think in terms of my own family and what I would give up for them. I don't know if I could be as strong as Owen. True to its genre, the book has twists that while not totally unpredictable, are surprising.

When Owen's boss is arrested for stock fraud Owen takes off with no explanation. Everyone is telling Hannah she never knew the real Owen.

Just a few visits by law enforcement and a few references to unseen powerful people who may or may not be angry at either of the central characters. Shockingly dull and pointless, with only the outline of an interesting character, one who seems to have not much in the way of an internal life. The things the book has going for it include a beginning, a middle, and something like an end, and a few interesting settings (a houseboat in Sausalito, Austin, Texas).

While I had a vague idea what the Book of the Month Club was all about, it was pretty vague.  This group talked about the five main picks every month like they were the greatest gift to readers everywhere.  My finances have been sorta sketchy for a while, so I would find out the main picks, then immediately go put a hold on them at my library’s website (and thank goodness for the library and ESPECIALLY their ebook access) and wait…and wait…and wait.  Turns out the BOTM books are really popular.  I grappled with myself for a while over whether it might be worth it to go ahead and join the club, that way I would not have to wait for ALL of the books and I would have an honest-to-goodness physical book in my grubby little hands.  I finally bit the bullet in February of 2021, figuring one book a month isn’t THAT expensive and I deserve that, right? I have to admit I completely regret joining.  I regret that I didn’t do it twenty years ago.  How did I miss this wonderfulness in a blue box once a month??  I regret that the club only allows a maximum of three books per membership (which, for almost every subscriber I know, is why they all have three different email addresses).  I have discovered authors I would have never run across without it and books I might have never picked up.  No, I do not work for BOTM, nor do I get paid to sing their praises, but I’ll do it anyway. This book is a prime example of why I am so glad I finally joined BOTM.  The beginning has a bit of a Sleepless in Seattle vibe, with a cross-country meet-cute including a single dad who lives on a house boat.  Hannah moves across the country with her furniture business to join her life to Owen and his daughter, Bailey.  Out of the blue, Owen disappears and Hannah receives a cryptic note to protect Bailey, and everything they knew is completely upended.  Hannah then discovers Owen really isn’t Owen, so she and Bailey set out on a mission to figure out what in the world is going on.  When they eventually find the answers, their world is a completely new landscape and Hannah has to make tough decisions without Owen’s guidance.  This book is so fast-paced, I reached the end without even realizing I was completely done with the book.  I felt like I had just run a NASCAR race in a convertible.

Hannah and Owen meet in New York, and begin a relationship, eventually leading to marriage and Hannah moving to Sausalito, CA to live with Owen and Bailey.  The relationship between Bailey and Hannah is strained, and Bailey wants nothing to do with Hannah.  This strained relationship is put to the test when Owen disappears, leaving both Hannah and Bailey cryptic notes.  All Hannah's note says is ""Protect Her"".  She assumes that the note means Bailey.The rest of the book is told alternating between the present, and the search for Owen, and the past.  First, the flashbacks are focused on the time Hannah and Owen spent dating, and then as the story progresses, stories that pertain to the drama that is building in their lives.  Law enforcement becomes involved, but Hannah does not entirely trust the investigators that are also trying to find Owen.  She and Bailey take off, on a hunch that the truth lies in Austin, Texas.  They hit the ground running, trying to find Owen on their own.The end of the book is surprising, and overall I really enjoyed reading this.  The plot was engaging, the writing style was easy to read, and the characters were relatable.  I have not read a book by Laura Dave before, but I would definitely check others out.

The writing itself was good, although it felt quite choppy. (I'm not sure if there was more than 5 sentences with a comma in them.)

How far are we willing to go to protect the ones we love?Hannah, a forty-ish artisan wood worker, is adjusting to her life with new husband Owen and her sullen sixteen year old stepdaughter Bailey, within the idyllic confines of their houseboat in Sausalito across the bay from San Francisco.Hannah, our narrator, is an unusual and very relatable character - emotionally scarred from her childhood, with the help of a beloved grandfather she has managed to shape the sum of her past into a kind of stoic even-footed resolve that is carrying her through adulthood. She’s strong, independent, yet also vulnerable and troubled by her failure to reach Bailey, who is (not too surprisingly) unwilling to embrace Hannah’s inclusion in what she sees as a firmly-closed-already-complete family unit.With the sudden disappearance of Owen, amidst a financial scandal and all the associated media frenzy, Hannah and Bailey are both thrown into upheaval, separate worlds imploding in a kind of unexpectedly shared and intimate crisis.“This is the terrible thing about a tragedy. It isn’t with you every minute. You forget it, and then you remember it again. And yet see it with a stark quality: This is what is required of you now, just to get along. “Desperate to find Owen and to understand his part in circumstances surrounding the disappearance, Hannah embarks on her own fact-finding mission, struggling to figure out just who her husband really is, or was; what secrets he may have been hiding; and how (or even, if) she can put the jaggedly newly acquired pieces back together to find the familiar core of the man she believes she loves.“In one way or another, this is the deal we all sign when we love someone. For better or worse.It’s the deal we have to sign again and again to keep that love. We don’t turn away from the parts of someone we don’t want to see. However quickly or long it takes to see them. We accept them if we are strong enough. Or we accept them enough to not let the bad parts become the entire story.”Aching with intensity, this is a terrific read which was impossible to put down, all the way up to it’s very neatly orchestrated conclusion, which hit all the right notes for me, and tied together the characters and story-line in a completely satisfying way.

Owen is a coder at The Shop, a tech firm, and Hannah hears on the news that his boss has just been arrested by the FBI. When Bailey finds a bag full of cash that Owen left in her locker at school, the two are even more flummoxed. Hannah and Bailey have had a rocky relationship, understandable for a new stepmother and a teenager, but they know Owen is a good man and they need to work together to find out what happened.When a US marshal and later federal agents arrive at their home, Hannah knows that something is seriously wrong. The US Marshall says Owen is not a suspect in the FBI investigation and he just wants to know Owen's whereabouts.

It is obvious that Hannah must try to work with Bailey to uncover what exactly is going on and who Owen - and Bailey - really are.Hannah is a well developed character while Bailey is less developed and portrayed more as a stereotypical teen with an attitude. They both have some advancement in their character development. Seeing Hannah and Bailey work together, learn to trust each other, and form an honest connection helps keep the plot interesting, especially when Bailey's early childhood memories lead them to Texas.The Last Thing He Told Me is well-written, although a little uneven in some sections. Chapters in the narrative follow the present day search for the truth and alternating chapters offer glimpses into the past relationship between Owen and Hannah. The past chapters provide insight into the current situation as well as providing some clues for Hannah and Bailey to follow. Hannah as a novice investigator is a bit less believable and the final denouement is a little improbable, but the lead up to it helps make it all work together to create an enjoyable novel with a touching final scene.

She loves her husband and is trying to be the best possible step-mom to his sixteen year old daughter Bailey, whose mother has died.  Hannah knows the pain of growing up without a mother - hers didn't die but,  she wasn't interested in mothering.  Fortunately, Hannah had an amazing grandfather who showed her plenty of love. He also taught her the fine art of woodturning, which results in unique pieces of very expensive furniture that she now creates and sells to wealthy clientele.  The couple along with Bailey live on a lovely houseboat in Sausalito, CA.One day Hannah is given a note which says: ""protect her.""  Little does she realize it just might be the last communication from Owen.  The same day Bailey comes home from school with a duffle bag and $600,000 cash that she claims she found in her locker.  Calls to Owen's cellphone go unanswered and the FBI has arrested the head of the big software start up company where Owen worked as a coder.  Where is Owen and why has he seemed to disappear off the face of the earth?As Hannah tries to ""protect"" Bailey she also determined not to sit and just wait for Owen to surface. She needs answers and soon begins to get some tips which lead her to believe Owen has not been completely honest with her and that she and Bailey may be in danger.The story is told from the POV of Hannah past and present. I loved her character and the way tried to gain Bailey's trust. She stepped up to the plate and did everything to protect her even though Bailey proved challenging at times.  I also liked that even though Owen disappears from the story early on, you really felt like you knew him and what his past was all about.  A tender, suspenseful character driven novel with some tense moments. I found the ending satisfying even though I was hoping for a bit more.  I love the way Laura Dave writes and I've enjoyed several of her earlier books as well.

After a few failed attempts to contact Owen, she and her stepdaughter embark on a fact-finding mission about what really happened.Historically, Hannah and Bailey do not get along in that Hannah tries to befriend Bailey whose mother died long ago and Bailey rebuffs any attempt at friendship. This makes their journey toward the truth that much more complicated. Through brief flashbacks on her marriage to Owen and present-day discoveries, her bonds to Bailey become stronger and what she finds out about her husband becomes more confusing.The writing, as in Dave's other books, is very good and moves you through the story. Many clues involve you in figuring out just what is going on, but some storylines disappear without a trace, and the climax doesn't really give you any concrete or shocking answers. It's almost too easy how it comes about and how it's settled. And any repercussions that result from the discoveries are not explored enough and, while the ending is somewhat bittersweet, it's a resigned ending. Hannah and Bailey appear numb. The epilogue could have been a little more revealing, too. I mean, how do they cope after all of this turmoil? They cannot just be content with the results.Anyway, this book did keep my interest and serves more as an exploration of a marriage. Can you love someone who has made grave mistakes and maybe isn't who he says he is? What will you give up to lead the life you want for you and your loved ones? Within the context of a mystery, these issues are brought up. I enjoyed reading it and think others will, too.Thank you NetGalley and Simon and Schuster for an advanced reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!

It's a thriller/suspense but it's quite different from what it sounds like it's going to be when you first read the synopsis, but after you read the book and reread the synopsis, you realize it sounds very close to what the book is going to be just in a way you weren't thinking before!There are a lot of reviews for this already, likely because of it being a Reese's Book Club pick, so I'm not going to do a very long synopsis here. You've likely already read a few by now already anyway by the time you get to this one.Hannah Hall has been married to Owen for just a year, a great year for her as he's the love of her life, but a year none the less when he disappears. He leaves her with a note that simply says, ""Protect her"". Hannah has no idea what's going on but she does know that the ""her"" being referred to is Owen's 16 year old daughter Bailey who isn't a big fan of Hannah. However, when things go from bad to worse and a US Marshall and federal agents show up at their home. Hannah and Bailey know that they must stick together, like it or not, and find out for themselves what the heck is going on and why Owen up and left them.This book is good. It's very well written. The characters are good and the idea behind each step is well thought out. What I wasn't the biggest fan of is Hannah seemed to know too much about certain lingo in certain situations that I'm not necessarily sure someone would just be able to casual be able to just have roll off their tongues having never lived in that sort of vocation or situation before. I also thought sometimes she made decisions that she may have forgotten to think about first. Not all the time. Sometimes she made some incredibly smart choices but not so much at others.All in all, I think this is a good book. It's one I would recommend for you to read because I think you need to see what you think for yourself. There are a lot of reviews and a lot of people really enjoyed this story.

Owen's sixteen year old daughter, Bailey, despises everything about Hannah but Hannah is determined to win her over someday. Life is good for Hannah, she loves her work, she loves both Owen and Bailey, she finally has a family after suffering for decades over feelings of abandonment because her parents left her when she was young. Then one morning, she kisses Owen as he heads to work and that's the last she sees of him. She gets a note, delivered by a little girl, that says ""protect her"". The FBI arrests his boss and shows up on her doorstep. Bailey's dad has left a HUGE puzzling gift for her in her locker at school. Things are falling apart and what Hannah knows about Owen is no longer adding up. Rather than waiting to see how things unfold, Hannah takes action. Based on a picture and very unreliable memories from when Bailey was less than 4 years old, they are off to a distant city to try to find out Owen's true identity. Is Owen who he says he is and if he's not, what does that mean for Hannah and even more so, for Bailey, his daughter? It's hard to imagine that I would make the choices that Hannah and Bailey make throughout the book but the good thing that comes out of all of this is that they both realize that they have each other through whatever is going on in their lives. What I was drawn to in this story is less the mystery and more the growing relationship between Hannah and Bailey. I think their reliance on each other and Bailey's change as she opens up to Hannah, while she convinces Hannah to be open with her, too, is what makes the story work for me. Their world has become a different, scary place and I enjoyed watching them work through the realization that their lives would never be the same again. Thank you to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for this ARC.",Where did Owen go?,,,,792,575,Public,4781

They are now living in a floating home in Sausalito, California with his daughter, sixteen-year-old Bailey, who is unsurprisingly not so enthusiastic about Hannah, her new stepmother.Right from the beginning, when a teenager from Bailey's school drops off a short note that says, 'Protect her', we are swept into the mystery of Owen's disappearance and the effort to find out what happened, where he is, and how he could have abandoned them.This suspenseful novel kept me hooked throughout. I could not put it down. The development of Hannah and Baily's relationship is very heartfelt, as Hannah earns Bailey's trust amidst the chaos that ensues. Many revelations pile up, about the company where Owen worked and FBI concerns about the CEO, who denies any wrongdoing. Then, a mysterious U.S. Marshal shows up at their home. She doesn't tell him about the note or about the duffle bag Bailey brought home from her locker at school, stuffed with cash.Interspersed with memories of the past year, as Hannah tries to figure out who this man she married really is, is a fast-paced journey to find out the truth while keeping Bailey safe.It's a wild ride and I enjoyed every minute of the two days it took me to devour this novel. There were a few inconsistencies or questions about Hannah's character and the past she remembers as well as what emerges from the mystery of Who is Owen?

Worse, he leaves his new wife, Hannah, and his daughter, Bailey, a bag full of cash and a note to Hannah simply saying ""Protect her"".  Hannah, convinced of Owen's innocence despite how everything may look, decides to set off on an expedition with Bailey to uncover the truth.  What she finds along the way will not only shock her and reveal that everything she knows about her husband may not be the truth, but also put her and Bailey in harm's way.This was a really fun read full of mystery and suspense.  I wouldn't classify it as a thriller but it did keep me at the edge of my seat and it was fun trying to figure out just what the heck was going on!  Regarding the believability, the storyline was admittedly pretty farfetched.  Much of Hannah and Bailey solving the mystery relied on fragmented conversations and gut feelings Hannah remembered about Owen from years prior, and even more out there, memories Bailey pulled out of thin air from when she was four years old.  While some of these leaps made me roll my eyes or have to backtrack to figure out 'wait, how did they put that together?!', they didn't ultimately take away from the story for me.Definitely a unique and fast read, one I would highly recommend!","Totally farfetched, totally unputdownable!",,,,249,179,Public,15152

Hannah and Owen have been married for one year when all of a sudden he disappears, leaving behind both Hannah and his sixteen year old daughter, Bailey, who is not a fan of Hannah's.  Up until Owen disappeared, he and Hannah have lived an enviable lifestyle, living on a beautiful houseboat in Sausalito.  Owen worked for a tech firm and Hannah made furniture for high end clients.  With Owen's disappearance we find that things may not be as they seem and that Owen is not who Hannah thought he was.

I couldn't put this book down; I wanted to know how this would end.This domestic suspense novel has all of the prerequisites to make it a good one with its well-developed characters, fast pace, and plenty of twists. The relationship between Hannah and her stepdaughter, Bailey, is what makes The Last Thing He Told Me memorable. As a new wife and stepmom, Hannah hadn't found common ground with Bailey yet. Bailey still viewed Hannah as the interloper after being raised solely by her single father, Owen. The portrayal of their awkward and challenging relationship is so realistic. With only each other to depend upon in this chase for the truth, they must work together to put together the pieces of the puzzle that is Owen's life and disappearance. Hannah's latent mama bear is ignited as she is determined to fulfill Owen's last request of her -- protect Bailey. The evolution of Hannah and Bailey's relationship is my favorite part of the book.

Owen and Hannah met and married and moved in together in his Sausalito floating home, all within the space of two years. But suddenly, their life is irreparably disrupted.Owen’s tech company’s CEO is arrested for fraud and stock manipulation. It’s a huge scandal, but making matters worse for Hannah and Bailey is that Owen disappears as the news breaks. He hasn’t been arrested, and he hasn’t been directly implicated or accused of wrong-doing. Instead, he simply vanishes, leaving Hannah a scrawled note telling her to protect Bailey.Hannah can’t believe that Owen is anything but a victim of circumstance, but his cryptic note confuses her. She’s even more disturbed when a Federal Marshal and then the FBI come knocking on her door, all looking for information on Owen’s whereabouts. With no way to reach Owen and no idea what he could be hiding, Hannah suggests to Bailey that they take matters into their own hands and go look for him instead.Based on some loose memories of Bailey’s from her early childhood, as well as hints from some of Owen’s stories of his college days, they’re soon on his trail — but Hannah is horrified to discover that none of the history Owen shared with her seems to be true. Not his real name, not his family background, not his education… and if all of this is fabricated, then who really is this man she fell in love with and married?Despite her own fears, Hannah realizes that she needs to honor Owen’s request to keep Bailey safe, even if Bailey seem to detest her and even if she doesn’t actually know what she’s protecting her from. But as they travel together to a new town and track down seemingly random facts and vague clues, they come to realize that they only have one another to rely on… and as they start putting the puzzle pieces together, Hannah becomes more and more certain that she may not like the answers she finds.The Last Thing He Told Me is an intricately plotted web of misdirection and secrets. Through flashbacks, we see Hannah and Owen’s courtship and marriage, and learn the stories he shared with Hannah about his past. In the present, we see Hannah being truly there for Bailey, and Bailey’s grudging realization that Hannah might be the only person in the world she can fully count on.There are deep, dark, dangerous secrets to be uncovered, and harsh truths for both Hannah and Bailey to confront. Ultimately, Hannah faces a decision that affects all of their lives, and only she has the ability to make sure that she’s choosing a path that carries out Owen’s wishes for Bailey.I did not see where the story was going, and I was completely hooked on trying to figure out Owen’s secrets and why he behaved the way he did. Needless to say, the resolution was not what I expected! Kudos to the author for keeping me guessing all the way through!In addition to the puzzle of the events of the story and the truth behind Owen’s disappearance, I really liked the developing trust and connection between Hannah and Bailey. I came to respect and admire Hannah very much — she’s put in an impossible situation, with no good options, and finds a way to do the right thing even when it feels like the worst choice in the world.I picked up this book before it was announced that this would be the Hello, Sunshine choice for May. I’m delighted to see it getting so much attention! The Last Thing He Told Me is a gripping, fascinating read that practically demands to be discussed, and I think it would make a great book group selection.Highly recommended!",Unputdownable!,,,,15,21,Public,4266240

He leaves a needlessly cryptic note for Hannah (the last thing he told her)… Get it? He also leaves a big ole bag of cash for his extremely annoying daughter Bailey.Hannah is great (really) and despite my concerns about the weak plotting of this story, she really shines as the reluctant step-mom, who while trying to find her husband, actually finds her own motherly instincts.OK, mild to complete spoilers ahead.Hannah and Bailey fly off to Austin for the most paper thin reason (reasons?) imaginable to find Owen who definitely isn’t in Austin. Our author certainly wanted most of the book to take place in Austin and gave us a reason for them to go there. I needed a little more rationale to buy it, considering so much hung in this location.The real reason Owen is missing is an info dump that was not rightfully earned. Hannah and Bailey stumble across the answer and boom—here are a couple pages that make all the previous speculation just a waste of time. I can forgive this, as it shifted the story, but again, it didn’t feel earned.Question: If Owen was so smart, why did he only leave a one sentence note for his wife? Dude could not have planned ahead a little more? Come on.Bailey, oh Bailey. This girl was a caricature of every surly teen on the CW whose parents just can’t understand her and geez, I need more sleep and food and… ugh. Enough Bailey, we get it, you’re difficult.And that ending. Nope. I don’t buy it and didn’t appreciate it. Our boy Owen is still in hiding? Give me a break. If we just ended with Hannah learning that she doesn’t need to be a biological mother to be the mother that Bailey needs, I would have been satisfied. What Owen did to these two women is frankly despicable and wholly unnecessary.3/5 stars: Read with caution or a very unquestioning mind.",Where are all the reasonable plot turns?

The author effectively blended an interesting mystery of a missing husband and father, Owen, with the unfolding of the relationship between his daughter, Bailey, and her stepmother, Hannah, as they search to discover what happened to him. The story started off with a bang and the pace kept up until the end. The plot was interesting and kept me guessing as to what would happen next. The author also did a good job of developing the characters. I will note that the story was told only from the point of view of Hannah, and it would have been interesting to also see Owen’s and Bailey’s perspectives. A 4 star read for me that kept me engaged throughout the story.Thanks to Simon and Schuster and Netgalley for an advance copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.",Loved it!,,,,26,12,Public,2959048

No blood, no gore, just a heart palpitating page turner that examines how far you would go to protect the people you love.Hannah has been living in California for a couple years with her new husband Owen and his 16 year old daughter Bailey.

Hannah and Bailey soon set out to uncover the truth, and in doing so, begin to figure out there’s more to Owen’s past than either of them ever knew. But finding out the truth comes at a price and they must make a decision that will change their lives forever.When you ask me for a beach read this summer, this is what I’ll be recommending.

I've never noticed this quirk in an audio book before but it is not necessary - the voices are drastically different so it is clear who is speaking and I find the continual ""he/Owen/She says"" or ""I said""  statements to be beyond annoying and distracting. SOOO Repetitive.  For example, this dialogue, ""What's wrong?""  I SAID  ""NOTHING"" HE SAID..................Bailey said let's go ""HE SAID""...it's so frequent it's abnormal.
