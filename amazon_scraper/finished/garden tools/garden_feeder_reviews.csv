Nothing other than water came out.  I yelled at it, turned it on and off - no joy.  I wrote customer service on FB and got an immediate reply but it was too test it in a white bucket and call back if I still had the problem.  Very nice person but not the answerThis version has no ""straw"" so think about what that means.  It means the cup has to be entirely full so the liquid is in contact with the top.  If it's not it won't work.  It's that simple.  It must be full before it will dispense fertilizerNext is quite a bit of the product sits un-dissolved on the bottom of the cup.  The answer?  Fill the cup with product in it almost to the top with waterr.  Stir until the product is completely dissolved.  It doesn't take long.One other problem people have complained about - leaking.  If there's no washer at the hose connection, it's going to leak.  Check to see that the washer didn't fall out at some point.

Leaks like crazy, not where yellow end meets hose, but where the yellow end meets container (see pic). No way to make it stop. Tried to hold the leaky part closed with hand, nope. Because so much of the hose water is pouring out before it gets to jar, the thing sprays weakly with a reach of about 2-3 ft. Took more than 15 solid minutes of squeezing trigger for jar to fill. (Pics are before it filled. Shut it off, did not want to be soaked with MiracleGro.)Silly me, did not even glance at reviews because I used one like this 15 yrs ago, and I thought it was the same thing.

The three position head adds to that flexibility.  Only had a very small leak using full power on the jet position, not much leakage but some compared to none on the other setting there was some but minimal.My only slightly non positive thought was that I wasn’t sure when the fertilizer was being applied at less than full strength as the base chemical was running out.  My solution was to dump the remaining jar contents into a watering can and dilute the remainder with water.  Turned out looking like the mix i normally use with a watering can.I made sure to take off the plastic cover on the jar before starting and I used only half of the fertilizer provided, and also thoroughly rinsed the jar and sprayed clear water to cleanse the head when I was finished.So much better than making 20 trips with a watering can.So five stars for me.Charles","Had Very Low Expectations, but",Size: 1 packVerified Purchase,46 people found this helpful,724936,198,47,Public

It is much more effective than hand mixing into a watering can and individually applying to each plant, especially if you have a large area to treat. Unfortunately, the mixing process does not seem completely worked out and the food mix does not seem to dilute well in the water. A small fill is supposed to treat a certain square footage, but after nearly doubling that area, I still had a large amount of mix left in the sprayer. It is still a step up from doing it by hand, but it really feels ineffective in terms of providing the right amount per plant or sq. /ft. based on the amount used during the process.","Sprays Great, Mixes Poorly",Size: 1 packVerified Purchase,39 people found this helpful,506002,420,105,Public

At first I did not experience any leaking as mentioned in my original review below, however, after a few uses the issue did start occurring.  At first I just kept trying to screw on the top more, but that was not the problem.  The sprayer has a yellow circle which allows you to select from 3 different spray patterns.  I noticed the source of the leak was that water was dribbling out from one of the 3 spray holes other than the main one that I had selected.  If you observe the face of the yellow circle and watch closely, you can rotate the spray pattern selector either to the left or right only a tiny amount, the dribbling will stop.  It's easy to see if you just watch it as you slowly turn the dial.  This solved the leaking issue for me so I hope this can possibly help others as well. ****  Original Review Follows:I didn't read reviews prior to purchasing this because I've had these in years past and never had any problems, plus,  I felt like the brand name of Miracle Gro was a name I could trust.  I began reading the reviews after the product arrived but before I actually used it.  Based on the large number of people who complained about excessive leaking, I figured I would probably have to return it.  So I was pleasantly surprised when I did use it, to find out that it did NOT leak.  I can't imagine all of these people are just making this up, unless the reviews were old and the design has been improved, however, it seemed to work fine for me.  My only comment is that when you turn on the water, it takes quite a while for the feeder tank to fill with water.  So based on the instructions, it would seem like you have to use it for several minutes before it will actually begin feeding  I'm thinking I could fill the tank with water first before I turn it on, to avoid this issue.",Not sure why all the negative reviews.,Size: 1 packVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,360336,48,26,Public

Just purchased this ""Miracle-Gro Garden Feeder"".  At first glance it seemed to be a cheap plastic version of what Miracle-Gro used to sell for the same purpose of applying fertilizer via a garden hose.  After my first use it was apparent that I completely underestimated the magnitude of the poor quality of this device.I connected it to the garden hose, per instruction; turned the hose on and slid the top thumb slide switch to begin the flow of product.  The plastic thumb slide switch popped out of the frame, leaving the application mechanism permanently engaged.  Not a big problem.  I adjusted the spray options.  Between each of the options, the water wildly sprayed out all around the front housing section of the applicator.  Once all was adjusted (best as possible) the water and mixture half heartedly projected out the front about three to four feet.I have used these types of applicators many times in the past.  Never had a problem.  I had always been very pleased with the results.  This time was a horribly pathetic demonstration of a slap-it-together plastic product that simply was too cheaply and manufactured and to poorly designed to ever work satisfactorily.  I would never buy this Miracle-Gro Garden Feeder again.  Now I am wondering if Miracle-Gro has taken the same shortcuts with the production of their plant chemicals as they have taken with his thing, proudly bearing the ""Miracle-Gro"" name.I expected better.

Not so much with this feeder. The main issue I have is the fact that you don't know what amount if any fertilizer is coming out. On some potted plants I could see evidence of fertilizer, blueish tint etc.. and the next pot, just clear water. I assume the way the suction of the fertilizer works is once the jar is 100% full of water it is forced to draw the contents of the jar into the flow of water. The flaw that I question is the first few minutes of spraying will be a higher amount of fertilizer because as you continue, more water is filling up the jar and diluting the mixture. In my case, I killed the first potted plant I fertilized and I'm really not sure how much the other plants received.I will continue to use Miracle-Gro but the old fashioned way.

I've used an older model for years and until I read reviews here, I had never expected blue tinted water out of this thing.  The only time I used to get very noticeable blue water with the old one is when I inverted it to clean it out once it was down to only dilute solution.  The very slight tint of the water normally is only noticeable in the right light.It probably does not put out the most even solution concentration, but for outside it works just fine.  There's a small stream of water that shoots into the mixing container that slowly dissolves the powder.  That pushes the solution into the water stream which shoots it out the nozzle.  This does not create the same concentration as if you hand mixed a bucket, but outside you have to put down more water than inside due to the higher evaporation and the water soaking into the surrounding soil which isn't such an issue in a potted plant.  The question is, are the plants getting enough fertilizer?  From my experience, they are.  I've never looked at the lawn or plants and thought, that spot didn't get enough fertilizer.  There's much more variation from the sprinkler heads putting out different water coverage and the amount of sun or shade than fertilizer would explain.If coverage is a big concern, just do a different pattern each time and go over areas more than once.  At what I would think is normal speed, I actually cover the area that the full container is rated for at least 2 or 3 times.  In fact, I used to only use about 1/4 of the powder to cover that area and go over it about twice, until I read the instructions on this one.I've also used miracle gro for vegetables, but I don't use a sprayer, I soak the ground and just pour the powder where the hose goes into the water channels, so can't comment on that use.The one thing I don't like about this new model is it is now made in 2 pieces to add the spray control and water control.  The old one was one piece and only had an on/off valve.  The 2 pieces make it feel a flimsier and I expect it might break, where the old one I have actually still works.  I only needed to replace it since the container's plastic got so old it cracked.","Works just fine, seems less sturdy than old model",Size: 1 packVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,88581,,,

The trigger handle does make it more tiring - I have a lot of flowers, so I may do this for 15-30 minutes each time.  I did have the leaky blue water problem, what fixed it for me was NOT tightening the lid so much, but backing it off just a smidge.  Otherwise, by filling the reservoir with fertilizer, and then water, THEN hooking it up, it is ready to go.  I never saw blue water coming out of my old one either, unless I tipped it way down, and that was clearly an overfeed. I figure if it is blue in the reservoir when i start, and it's not blue when I finish, I fertilized the flowers. I find the different setting to be helpful, as I water the leaves and blooms with the shower or flat setting, and some larger plants I shoot at the roots with the jet.

I will list by number the things I found wrong with this particular feeder.1.  Pressure is not very good on any of the settings.2.  Dispenses product unevenly3.  Dispenses product to fast or to slow or not at all4.  Have to turn upside down at times to get product to come out even after it is mixed really well5.  The setting spin on the front the dial does more harm then good at letting the water out in a certain way6.  No hose or tube inside the bottle or bowl area to pull product through everything is based on how much water is in bowl.Ok to be fair these are the positives1.  Light weight2.  Arrived on time3.  Does come with Miracle product inside of it ready to go.4.  The water shut off Does work ok5.  The product shut off to allow only water to get through works OK also.As I said I love and I use Miracle grow however I am not at all impressed with this dispenser and or there liquid dispenser. For a company that puts so much hard work into a great product to help plants grow you would think they would put more effort and ideas into how to dispense the product onto the plants and not sell cheap stuff at a higher price.Two stars because it showed up early and I like that that is one star, it was packaged well and arrived brand new, that is two stars. Did come with product inside that I love and it does not leak and it did put the product onto my garden even if I did not like the way it did it so that is the third star.I finally had to downgrade this to a two star, wow I really do not like this product.

I wish I would have tried the feeder years ago! I was reluctant to try it because of the ratings, but this is SO much better than the watering can method. I have a fairly large garden so using the watering can used to take me at least an hour where I now feed the garden in about 10 minutes. Wow, so much more convenient! I now have two, one for tomato feeding and another for feeding the rest of the garden. There are a few issues with the feeder as reported by others, but these are easily overcome. First, it does leak where it screws onto the hose IF there is not enough water pressure. When the pressure is increased the leaking stops. Second, it does leak from the top when stored full, but this can be resolved by pouring out the top layer of water before storing the feeder. These simple solutions to the design flaws more than make up for never having to feed by hand again.
