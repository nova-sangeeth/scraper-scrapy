This sprayer is so easy to use.  The way it works is you fill the sprayer with your choice chemical, pump the handle until the air pressure builds (you will feel the resistance in the handle when the pressure is built) point the nozzle and spray.  So easy!  The container is a good thick quality, wand is 12"" and the hose is 28"" which makes maneuverability nice and easy.  This sprayer has a convenient funnel top which helps prevent liquid from running down the sides when you are filling it.I use this with insecticidal soap on my houseplants and on my garden plants.  The spray is nice and even and it has a nice wide spray width.  The nozzle is adjustable and the wand is easy to reach into bushes or up into small trees.  This sprayer mists everything leaving a nice coat on the leaves without dumping out too much product.  This is nice because my liquid lasts longer.  I have never had any issues with this sprayer and would recommend this.  If this review is helpful to you in any way, please let me know by clicking on helpful.

It's never quite as ""misty"" as I'd like, but it's adequate for spraying weeds, and for the price I can't complain. The wand and tips are usually the weak points in these home sprayers, so  I looked into buying new ones but it was more than the complete tank.It probably doesn't help that I leave chemicals in it for extended periods. I once left liquid in it so long that I forgot whether it was weed killer or insecticide, so disposed of it by spraying an area that needed both.  I then decided to get another dedicated sprayer and label them.  This seemed easier than cleaning them out after every use because that's just not gonna happen, to be honest.The lock and release action of the pump mechanism for carrying is smoother and easier than with others I've tried, and given the abuse it takes it's a great deal.The Smith was twice as much, and the wand is a bit longer.  It feels more robust and sprays mistier, but that could change.  The twist and lock action isn't as smooth as the Chapin, but other than that they're pretty similar.","Four years later, still working",Size: 1 PackVerified Purchase,580 people found this helpful,

The extendable part is brass and is slightly bent at the tip. The bend is important because just by turning your hand slightly while spraying, you can get the underside of the leaves. It fits the hose that comes with the sprayer.

I appreciated that offer. The replacement arrived and it was only the pump handle assembly. The old assembly is embedded / broken off in the old tank and not easy to remove. I ended up drilling into the old assembly and tried to extract it that way. I broke drill bits but that's my own fault. By the time I got the old broke assembly out, I had unfortunately drilled into the tank body a tiny bit. This is because there is nothing of substance in the center of the assembly and you must drill near where it meets the tank threading. This caused my unit to leak slightly when pressurized; it still works but it also sprays solution mist on my hand and arm instead of the intended target.Original review:I used this sprayer 3-4 times a week for 2 months. I enjoyed the form factor, the handle, and the wand with adjustable sprayer tip. This sprayer would have come highly recommended by me except for one fatal design flaw.Everything hinges on the pump handle. When it's full, there is very little stability in holding this device by the intended handle.To tighten the lid you must turn the pump handle. It catches the lid assembly by two small blocks. Those blocks are horribly undersized and should have been re-enforced. If you tighten the lid adequately tight to form a seal and try to loosen it, it could break on you. They broke on me with relatively little force. When these tiny pieces break, it renders the entire unit landfill trash. In an emergency, i had to use a funnel to supply some product to the cylinder since the pumping and spraying mechanism still technically work - however it would be too cumbersome to do this daily.",Worked nicely for 2 months,Size: 1 PackVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,

There were two major issues with this thing, the first of which in my opinion makes it worthy of a recall. After using the sprayer as directed, it looked like it was completely out of spray and air in the container but when I opened it up to refill it, it vented directly into my face, wetting my eyes with weed killer, going into my mouth and onto my face. This sprayer shouldn't even be capable of doing something like that, there should be some sort of safety measure on it to prevent that from ever happening. The other problem is that while walking around the yard holding the handle while I was spraying, it kept coming unlatched and causing the handle to come loose.

I thought about drilling a hole through it the cap so I could get the hose in, but that would not have made a difference since there was a second defect in the canister:  a big hole drilled in the side opposite the sealed hole - this hole had no thread or connector, so there was no way to attach the hose.  Perhaps this was for a pressure release valve?  But this model was not intended to have a valve, and there was none in the package.

Otherwise, it pressurizes really well... though makes a very annoying squeaking noise while doing so. And the spray shoots a good 10-15' I'd guess. You can twist & adjust the nozzle to get a finer mist or a heavy stream spray which will affect the distance the spray will reach.

I keep finding more uses.  While I still use spray bottles, I use this for bigger cleaning projects to mist various cleaning solutions.  It is great for spraying on window cleaner on windows outside the house.  Works for laying down a fine mist of cleaning solution on patio furniture.  It can be used to mist a cleaning solution on your car.  I use the washing soda and dish soap solution in the tank as well as a vinegar and water solution.  I believe any cleaning solution could be added to the tank.  I may try a solution with dish soap to spray roses for aphids.  I am very pleased with this purchase.Original review:I didn't buy this for yard use.  I purchased it to mist a popcorn ceiling to help with removal.  The popcorn ceiling had previously been painted, so misting didn't facilitate removal.  However, this tool was so easy to use, I figured out how to repurpose it around the house.I needed to clean some folding chairs.  I added hot water, a few drops of dawn dish washing liquid and 1/2 cup Arm and Hammer WASHING SODA (this is NOT baking soda!) to the container.  I put the chairs in the shower one at a time and sprayed them liberally with the Washing Soda solution and scrubbed them with a brush.  Rinsed with the shower wand.My next project was to spot clean a carpet.  I sprayed the Washing Soda solution on the worst areas prior to shampooing the carpet.  This sprayer made it easy to lay down a controlled mist without soaking the carpet.My third cleaning project was a fabric upholstered recliner.  I sprayed the Washing Soda solution on the chair and then towel dried it.This doesn't work like a pressure washer.  What it does is lay down a light mist.  Going back over an area more than once will give you heavier coverage.Oven racks may be a future project.  I'll take them outside to clean while the oven is self cleaning.The tank size is perfect for household use.  Not too big or heavy when filled.  I have used spray bottles for years.  This sprayer is much easier to use than a spray bottle.",Who knew?  Forget the lawn. This is an awesome cleaning tool!,Size: 1 PackVerified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,

The Chapin 16100 actually has this feature, and so I (foolishly) assumed that this newer sprayer would include it - my mistake - but it still causes me to lower the rating. The biggest reason for the low rating is that it is impossible to let the pressure out of the sprayer without getting residue on your hands and probably also on your face. I have another (very old Craftsman) sprayer that is engineered in much the same way as this Chapin, and the Craftsman sprayer has an enlarged flange as part of the piece that screws into the sprayer body.

I started spraying my walls and foundation last year with the Chapin 20000 sprayer to hold back the influx of tiny, little six-legged critters into the house and so far, I am impressed. This sprayer is really sturdy - one heavy-duty, single-piece molded polythene with a screw-on top-&-pump handle. It is easy to fill - it has a wide mouth with markings on the inside of the container for English and metric volumes. It is easy to carry - it is rugged, compact, and lightweight. The pump handle makes a convenient carry point and I have not felt the need for a shoulder strap. It is easy to spray - just pump it up, adjust the spray pattern at the nozzle, and press the lever to spray. One gallon will make it around the house about once without doing the windows; one-and-a-half gallons for everything and the patio is about right for us. Especially helpful: I came across a wasp's nest while spraying the walls last month and easily changed the spray from a fan to a high-pressure stream and hit the nest from about ten feet away ... and then I ran like a felon.Downsides: No release valve. You need to release any residual pressure by bleeding it with the wand and untwisting the top very slowly and carefully or you *will* get a faceful of whatever you are spraying. You have been warned. Also, lean the sprayer in something or against something when not in use; it does not stand well on its own. Nor is there a holster for the wand; again, lean it on something. When not in use, I store everything back in the carton it was shipped in and that keeps everything tidy at hand. For twelve bucks, this is a great deal. Recommended.Update, 31 Aug 2019:  Five years later and this baby is still going strong.

Have sprayed about 15 gallons of herbicide.  My rating factors in price, which at under $10 is a bargain.  There is no pressure relief valve, no constant on spray setting, all of which are available on more expensive models.  But it does a fine job without bells and whistles.  At just a gallon, it only spays for about 10 minutes at constant use with a moderate density spray setting.  Need to pump again about 1/2 through the gallon.  So for large projects like mine, which included measuring and adding herbicide concentrate with water for about 15 gallons, it was 10 minutes of spraying, 5 minutes of reloading repeated for about 15 cycles (point top of bottle away from you, unscrew cap, measure 1 oz, herbicide, add 1 gallon water, screw cap back on, shake, pump, spray).  So it does get a bit tedious, and a 2 gallon sprayer would cut the refill cycles by half, but also increase carrying weight.  I did add my own strap by drilling through the two indents on the neck, put there for this purpose.  But with the one gallon spaying being so light and requiring such frequent refills, I would probably skip the strap if I was to do it again.  It's just not that heavy and the strap got in the way a bit during refills.  Spray pattern selections are wide, and the stream setting can reach at least 10 feet at full pressure.  Tabs that hold the handle down under pressure (with a twist to latch at full compression) appear to be plastic, so probably won't last long, but have lasted for 15 gallons at least.  I would have been happy to get just one large project done at this price, but it appears I will be able to many more.

But if you are like me, an ordinary homeowner that was using the little squeeze trigger bottles to apply insecticides or lawn products, you will be wondering why you waited so long to purchase this little guy. What I like about this product--lightweight, easy to carry because the plunger locks into the pump for easy handling, the top of the sprayer is shaped to allow easy addition of what you are spraying, the sprayer wand fits into two notches on the plunger handle for storage, easy to disassemble. Two things to remember. 1. After each use- pour in clean water and spray it to clean out sprayer hose. 2. This unit does not have a pressure relief valve so when you are done spraying and there is still pressure in the tank, tip the tank upside down until the air in the tank expels what is left in the wand and then keep letting the air out until there is no more air pressure coming out of the wand. If youdon't and you unscrew the pump with the pressure still in the tank, you may get a blast in the face of whatever you are spraying.

It sprays properly, and the construction of the tank seems to be very sturdy.  Compared to other sprayers, this one was very inexpensive.  It's pretty straightforward and easy to use.Now, the bad.  Every single thing is made of plastic.  This is fine of course, except for the ""shut off handle"" a.k.a. sprayer handle a.k.a. the trigger.  It's basically a plastic lever that needs to use a fairly large amount of force to pull the plunger upwards, causing the spray.  Apparently nobody told the designers that plastic bends with force, and therefore the little ""forks"" slip off the plunger very easily.Since this was the first time I used it, I sent a message to customer service on the company's website asking if there was a fix or replacement for the one part.  I have yet to hear anything back at all.EDIT: They were slow, but did finally get a response.  They are sending a replacement.  I'm adjusting the rating up a star because of this.To fix the problem, I brushed the plastic in a thin layer of JB weld.  Now, it doesn't slip off.Since most of the other reviews are positive and don't have this problem, I'm thinking it may be a certain batch with weaker plastic or something of that nature.

The container is very thick and obviously safe for the usually corrosive type stuff often used in these things. And putting it together was very easy (I didn't need the instructions and I'd never done it before).When really pumped up it has a great spray range for something so cheap-which made spraying my attic and crawl-space with bug spray a great deal easier.The only thing I'd have to give a (-) on is that when I was spraying at close range (like the corner grout in my kitchen) it was hard to lighten the pressure enough to keep it from splashing a lot.

It's easy to get the desired width of dispersion.Downside is that the unit I received does not hold pressure.  I can hear air escaping around the top no matter how hard it's tightened down.  The unit still is usable, as I can make do by giving it a few pumps before each spray.  But I had hoped for better quality.UPDATE:  Scanned the reviews by ""most recent"" and noticed that over the past month or so there are markedly more negative reviews than before. Maybe a bad batch?  Or maybe the ""quality fade"" (google it) common of made-in-China products.",Doesn't hold pressure,Size: 1 PackVerified Purchase,,

Easy to fill, assemble and use. A few pumps provides a significant amount of spray. I used this for gardening and for spraying cleaning fluid when I had to apply cleaning fluid to a large area of pavers.One note: This does not have a locking mechanism to keep the nozzle spraying. While it is very easy to pull the trigger, when spraying a large space like a garden area, your hand will eventually begin to ache. A little locking mechanism would have really gone a long way. I would guess that other models have this feature.",Great Sprayer,Size: 1 PackVerified Purchase,,

Yes, I checked the box to make sure--the parts were definitely missing.We put it together anyway and my husband showed me how to use it, but I'm returning it (and not replacing it) because my husband said his from Home Depot feels more secure--the lid locks into place more and seems a little better quality (to be fair, I don't know how much it was or what brand it was). Just going to use his (after washing it) or get the same one. Not worth the hassle of waiting for the replacement, and my roses need the fungicide sprayed before then!Disappointed that so many parts were missing.

My clothes and face are doused in fish emulsion fertilizet because the hose into the tank gently snaps in to place and seems to pop right out under pressure and tension on the spray wand.Similarly the pump handle seems to spritz tank contents under too much pressure.

Easy to use and works perfectly for the reason I bought it. I am absolutely freaked out by any type of bug in my house at all. So I use a bug killing product called Demon WP.

Pump it up and it holds pressure for a long time, allowing you to cover a great area without having to stop and pump again to create more pressure. Has a convenient handle, and the wand sprays whatever you're spraying accurately in whatever location you want.","Great product, can't go wrong",Size: 1 PackVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,
