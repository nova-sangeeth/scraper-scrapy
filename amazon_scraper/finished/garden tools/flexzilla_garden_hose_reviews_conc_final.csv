The hose had changed from day-glow green, to a muddy, black-spotted, moldy mess that rubs off on your hands. I initially missed the critical reviews that provided pictures and accurate descriptions of what I would have experienced in a few months. Additionally, I understand that the warranty for the hose will not be honored by the manufacturer if a claim is made because of the mold. Amazon needs to assess it's customers' experience with this product and the manufacturer's total lack of transparency about the mold issue.",This hose has a BIG problem that is not being addressed by the manufacturer,"Size: 5/8"" (inches) x 50' (feet)Style: HoseVerified Purchase",371 people found this helpful,,,2425.0,525.0,Public,5231.0

Like many frequent Amazon buyers  I have to be either especially happy or unhappy to take the time to do so and there have been very few such cases. This is one of the latter.From the time I put this hose into service it seemed that my water pressure and the amount of water I was getting was much less than I had been getting from my last hose of the same dimension (nominally 5/8"" x 100'). I was at a loss to understand why, but this is a big problem for us as our water pressure is marginal to start with. When I took the hose off my hose reel to investigate I thought I found the answer. In order to attach their ""Exclusive SwivelGrip Action"" connector Flexzilla relies on an inside piece to hold the connector in place while allowing it to swivel. As you can see from the photo, this inside piece reduces the actual inside diameter from the advertised 5/8"" (which the hose I'm sure does meet) to approximately 3/8"" for the entire ""hose system"", thus significantly reducing the capacity of the hose and making it entirely useless for me.I called Legacy Manufacturing, the company which makes Flexzilla hoses and described this situation to the Customer Service person I talked to and to a technical support person they referred me to. Neither was familiar with this issue, although the tech support person thought it might have to do with the material they use to make their connectors. But whether it would impact flow rates or pressure, he had no idea. But he said he would check with someone more senior and have someone else call me. No one ever called.I've now replaced the hose with one that was half the price and will either be giving this away to someone with much better water pressure or simply throwing it away. But if you NEED a 5/8"" hose THIS HOSE IS NOT FOR YOU!","This hose functions more like a 3/8"" hose than the 5/8"" hose it claims to be!","Size: 5/8"" (inches) x 100' (feet)Style: HoseVerified Purchase",267 people found this helpful,,,274.0,8.0,Public,707058.0

You shouldnt take the bad reviews to heart to much like i did which caused me a bunch of wasted time cause I debated on buying this 50ft swivel grip hose for months now due to the higher price and the handful of negative 1 star reviews I've looked over so many times wondering, but finally decided to pull the trigger and spend the extra cash to get it. For me it was worth every penny and I don't say that much about stuff!!! I have to admit I'm very surprised with this wonderful thought and made hose! And so happy I bought it. I have no idea where all the 1 and 2 or even 3 star review's came from because I have not experienced or noticed any of them problems and suspect some of them may be due to either not knowing what they were doing or just bad luck but my hose as of now is 100% perfect!!! Knock on wood lol...I didn't even experience any trouble unrolling the first time, I mean sure it tried to twist a few times but using the grips the hose spun right into shape and didn't slow it down a bit and that was before it had pressure! After hooking up to faucet I was amazed how nice the grips made it in tightening onto spicket or faucet and also installing sprayer end. They don't seem to cheaply made to me like I read and work awesome. I can cracking them by over tightening them like all plastic ends would do but these are thicker then others I've seen! Also I can just walk anywhere with hose following behind and not twisting or kinking at all. Simply amazing just like their air hose I've had for years!!! I'll keep an udate going as the next few weeks to a month pass by as I will have this in my hand at least twice a day this summer plus the wife kids will be using it also. But right now I'm extremely happy and seems to be well worth the money,and if all stays good will be buying a couple more for the rest the propertyUPDATE 5/14/19: This hose is still my best hose I've ever owned and it's still held up with rough use and not stored in the Indiana winter. Didn't bust, crack, leak or anything and I'm back to daily use again. It's never kinked on me, never leaked and is just an amazing hose. Imy ordering 2 more just like it later this week!

The cheap vinyl hose had oozed plasticizer onto the reel. This gunk took a long time to scrape off and clean.  I thought this hose would be a decent replacement.  I was wrong.Although this is marketed as a 5/8"" hose, the female end of the hose is restricted to 0.432"", as measured by a Starrett dial vernier caliper.  (Measured in both x and y axis)  This is really small in diameter.  Actually, the area of the hose is 2.09 times bigger than the area of the restriction.  Yes, that means the area of the restriction is less than 1/2 of the main hose.  Come on, Flexilla, you can do better than that!For me this means that a standard spring meant for a rotating hose reel which is 0.450"" in diameter cannot be used.  The spring is to prevent the hose from collapsing when it makes a tight radius turn in the hose reel.  The spring cannot fit through the restriction.  The hose is not fit for the purpose that I bought it for.  I suppose I could cut off the end and put on a ""real"" hose end.  On a brand new hose?  Kind of crappy to have to fix a design defect on a new product.You would think buying a hose would be easy.  I never even thought I'd have to watch out for ""cheating"" undersized hose ends.  Just looking at a few descriptions of hoses, they never mention hose end diameters, either here on Amazon, or elsewhere.  Why is that?  THAT'S BECAUSE THE HOSE ENDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME DIAMETER AS THE HOSE!  Or at least close.  0.430"" is a long way from 0.625"", the specified ID.  Even the cheapo drain hose that I bought for a dehumidifier measures 0.530"" on a rated 1/2"" ID hose hose.

However, I’ve been through several garden hoses over the years and while I’ve only had this one a month or so, it’s already been through a few paces, so I thought I’d write one now.The last few hoses I’ve used have been very thick heavy rubber (think Goodyear) because anything else seems to fall apart.  The downside is these get especially cumbersome to maneuver due to weight, especially a 100ft hose full of water and they ALWAYS kink.This hose is amazingly light and maneuverable; frankly it’s unbelievably light.  And while it’s still very early, it seems to be of a material that is going to hold up.  And I’ve test it, and it won’t kink, at least not that I’ve run across yet.So overall I’m VERY pleased with this hose.  But that said, I have two concerns; one possible, and one definite.The possible concern is that the hardware, the male and female connectors and how long they’ll last.  Nothing specific to this brand, I’ve just found this to be a weakness from hose manufacturers.  I just hope my positive review isn’t too hasty in this regard.The definite concern is the color.  The only option is the awful lime-green-yellow, whatever it is, color option.  I recently got a call from the Space Station asking me to turn it off…kidding…sort of.  Maybe some like the neon color but ideally some more traditional options such as a forest/lawn green (and if visibility while in the lawn is an issue, perhaps a very thin neon striping) would be nice.Overall, so far, very pleased.",Very pleased...but more color options please.,"Size: 5/8"" (inches) x 75' (feet)Style: HoseVerified Purchase",6 people found this helpful,,,279.0,66.0,Public,729776.0

I always look for ways to set up and break down quicker from my details allowing me to move to the next job and possibly even get extra jobs on for the day. I really like durable hoses; however, because they last longer and cost me less in the long run. Usually durable means some construction grade hose that can be run over by cars all day, but they weigh a ton and are especially hard to reel back in when its colder weather outside. This hose has been amazing. Its light weight, flexible (which allows me to twist and contort the hose nozzle allowing me to get to certain areas like wheel wells without the nozzle twisting loose and spraying me), has a smooth texture that doesn't mar a vehicle if it happens to come in contact with it, and using it with a hose reel is highly recommended as it is extremely easy. While the hose will lay flat, when you bring it back in the hose still needs to be twisted as its coiled back up. A hose reel seems to fix that problem. Still, its relatively easy to put up and the cold weather doesn't effect it.I'm giving this hose 5 stars because it works like it's supposed to and because I like innovation.

I wanted the convenience of being able to leave the hose on all the time.  I know it’s risky but my plan worked.

So, it was a no-brainer for me to order two of the 10' hoses for a project on which I'm working. The hoses have two MAJOR problems. First off, the composition of the hose is different. It HAS a very good memory! When they came they were coiled in their package. I took them out of the package and they retained their coiled shape. I then ran hot water through one of them to get it to loosen up. No deal! It still retained its coiled shape. On top of that, when it bent, there was a kink that reduced the water flow- just like all of the cheap garden hoses on the market!Then, on top of all of that, Flexzilla decided that they need to put new grips on the ends of the hose that allow you to tighten or remove the hose from another. Not to my liking! Give me the old-style anytime! These add bulk to the ends of the hose that I don't like.I'm very disappointed in Flexzilla for making the composition change! Not sure why companies do this when they have a good product already!My advice is to look for the old-style hose- the ones that don't have the new grip on them.","Flexzilla ""new style""- avoid it!","Size: 5/8"" (inches) x 10' (feet)Style: HoseVerified Purchase",,,,32.0,19.0,Public,3556414.0

It's definitely lightweight and easy to coil back up on the wall mounted hose reel.

The good thing is the hose has no memory like other vinyl or rubber hoses where they kink and seem to always occur in the same spot. This hose is definitely different in that aspect it doesn't rekink over and over in the same spot. On a side note, if you leave the water on and coil the hose back up on the reel the loops come out more evenly sized this works on any garden hose.

I spent so much time researching water hoses. I really wanted something light weight that still has decent pressure and is reasonably easy to use. That's it. This hose doesn't feel any lighter than my old vinyl hoses, maybe because it's so flexible that it takes more effort to move around the garden whereas a stiff hose, and even a full pocket hose, can be flicked around a bit.  The claims that it never kinks and lays flat with no memory, are categorically not true.  It is flexible and it does have less memory than vinyl, which makes it an absolute monster to try to put back on the hose hanger.  It's so flexible and has just enough memory that it constantly twists itself into knots.  I thought that maybe it would improve with use, but I've used it a few times now and it's just a nightmare.

I ordered the 75 ' hose and it is very lightweight and definitely much easier to reel in.  I really hated dragging in my old hose after every use because it was prone to kinking.  After just one use there were no issues with reeling it in. I truly look forward to using this for a long time.,Extremely easy to reel in,"Size: 5/8"" (inches) x 75' (feet)Style: HoseVerified Purchase",,,,1.0,4.0,Public,9184314.0

When moved around the yard it always gets more than 1 kink.  The hose has a “memory” of the coil it was put in when new.  It wants to return to the coil even when stretched out.  Getting it put back after use is a major task.  Keep your old hoses - this is NOT worth the money!,Not as advertised,"Size: 5/8"" (inches) x 75' (feet)Style: HoseVerified Purchase",,,,,,,14169215.0
