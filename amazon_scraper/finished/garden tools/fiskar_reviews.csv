The wife and I tested it on a weed in our lawn at dusk just to see if it worked. It not only pulled out the weed but also the sinister, soulless root! It ejected the lifeless carcass just like the video and even made the trademark cocking sound like a 12 gauge ""shicack!"".We were so pumped we told all our friends and neighbors to gather round a weed at sunset in our street side planting strip to witness the genius of mankind in all its weed destroying glory. Aim, stab, lever ""shicack!"". The crowd went wild, women screamed, children jumped for joy and grown men were moved to tears. After speaking a curse on all weeds left in the planting strip we placed the weeder over our mantle vowing to raze all weeds at the crack of dawn.Sunrise...The Mrs. and I dawned our gardening gear, sprayed some SPF 50 on exposed areas and grabbed the weeder. With a stoic nod and an affirming grunt the Mrs. began unleashing the dogs of garden war on the planting strip for 60 minutes. If you weren't a thriving clump of El Toro Zoysia you were ripped from your unholy seat and violently deposited into the Green Recycle Bin like a dead Christmas tree in July.Then it happened. While ripping out a clump of sleeping grass that can only be described as barbed wire with leaves, a snapping noise came from the ejection slide and the handle went soft. The jaws went limp as the weeder gasped its last breath. The sleeping grass, half ripped out of the ground sat there with a sinister smile.As we made our way back to the house friends, neighbors and loved ones lined the driveway to pay their respects to the excalibur of weeding tools. After a short eulogy, the weeder was placed back on the mantle a shadow of its former self.Fiskars Deluxe Stand-up Weeder (4-claw)You came.You conquered.You died.You'll never be forgotten.Godspeed to Valhalla where you battle weeds everyday along side your weeder brothers and sisters!",It will break....

Ok everyone having issues with this product, here's the thing:I had an issue in the past also, and I guess part of it was my fault. You have to remember, that you are jamming these claws into the earth, which if it's not moist or wet enough, is going to push back on the claws and eventually either bend or break them. My advice would be, to either WAIT for it to rain, or wet your yard REALLY REALLY GOOD, then go out there and weed. When there's water on the ground from the day before, the claw will go into the earth like butter. THEN, it's a pleasure to weed out the yard and look at it! Also, I had tried this other tool in the past on my backyard where the earth is more packed in, and that's where I had an issue. Hence why I'm saying what I'm saying.

I used it on some medium-large weeds, *gently* (I didn't pursue on the bigger weeds if the weed didn't want to come up), and it broke within 20 minutes (plastic close to the base of the jaws broke clean off), rendering it entirely useless.  I do not recommend this product .... sad, because the jaws are spaced for larger plants, but the materials (plastic) are not suitable. This has made me hesitant to buy any Fiskars product that is based on plastic.  Also, the tines bent within 10 minutes of use, before the base broke off.  I returned the item and Amazon refunded me the price quickly.I since then purchased the following 2 tools which I really liked and are saving us quite a bit of effort:- Yard Butler RKT-1000 Rocket Weeder Steel Weed Remover  (all steel, completely sturdy, our first choice for the larger weeds)- Grampa's Weeder by Oswego Enterprises (slightly smaller jaws than Yard Butler which means it can get smaller plants that Yard butler can not; has wood handle so maybe not quite as sturdy as yard Butler, but no problems so far, however, only used it on the smaller weeds that Yard Butler  could not get).  no eject button, but that's not a big deal as most weeds fall out, and some get stuck which require manual intervention anyway.I will be reviewing these other 2 products on their respective pages as well.I live in the rural Southwest, where tumbleweeds and all sort of weeds prevail.","Big jaws, lousy materials",Style: WeederVerified Purchase,374 people found this helpful,

I had read the concerns from others regarding breaking but then observed that most break because people use their foot on it like a Shovel. Use foot only if necessary to push straight down into the weed. But the KEY point is to let the tool do the work and tilt it toward you or the side to clamp on to the root and then you pull the weed.If you keep pounding the foot-lever you may damage or break it, if you push your foot at an angle like a shovel maybe you will also eventually break it.I had a ton of overgrown weeds and this tool made it faster than I have ever been able to clear out large parts of my yard. It only struggled with very large thick weeds because I had let them overgrow for months. With most weeds I had absolutely no issues and it worked very fast. It also has a clamp release once you pull the weed to quickly dump it into a bag or bin.Yes it does sometimes take out a large dirt clump and it works best if the soil is moist or soft, but I didn‚Äôt really think any of these were big downsides.Overall I recommend this tool and it appears this model and version is the latest from Fiskars with improvements from the previous version. As long as you don‚Äôt expect it to be as strong as a shovel, pick, or ax, it‚Äôs great and I hope I will be using it for many years to come.FWIW it does come with a pretty good warranty from Fiskars so that helps also.",Awesome tool.

It is probably one of the best tools I've purchased in the last 20 years. Seriously, I hope the inventor becomes a millionaire, he/she deserves it. What a fantastic, brilliant idea. Just take a large bucket, pull up the dandelion & dump it in the bucket. Once you get in a rhythm, it's fast & extremely easy. It's best to do it after you've softened the earth by watering deeply or after a soaking rain, I can see where the plastic foot part on the back can break if you're doing it in dry dirt (I tried it after the lawn had dried out & it was hard to pull them out, so I quit). I've only used it for a few hours & pulled up about 75 dandelions, but I just can't say enough about how impressed I am. The first few times, I removed some of the dirt from the pulled dandelion & put it back in the hole but then I decided to leave the hole because it's just like aerating your lawn by taking out plugs, only the holes from this tool are a little larger (about 1"" vs 1/2"" with aeration). The main thing is to get the dandelion puller centered over the weed so it gets the entire root out (some of the roots were so long that 2-3"" were extending past the tool, but still came out intact!). I will definitely buy this tool again if it ever breaks. After fighting dandelions for decades & spending hours digging them up each year, ending up with a sore back & having the root break off & the plant re-grow (I won't use weed killer), this Fiskars Deluxe 4-claw stand-up weeder is fabulous.",VERY Impressed!,Style: WeederVerified Purchase,32 people found this helpful,

I have been able to pull out mountains of weeds in a few hours. Without pain.I discovered that if I pulled the weeds the day after it rained they came out roots and all, including a clump of soil, often with earthworms. I stacked all the weeds in a pile and wait a day or two for the attached soil to dry just a bit. Then get comfortable on my gardening bench and loosen the soil over a bucket (with a sieve made from two nested nursery trays with 1/2‚Äù steel mesh in between) to recover the soil to refill the holes caused by weeding. Sounds like a lot of work, but really very easy and the yards look civilized again. I was also happy to find more of our regular grass had survived than I had hoped.A few of the reviews I read before buying mentioned the plastic lever breaking. I can imagine that happening, but experience has shown me that if you have trouble the first attempt with a particular weed, just change direction and try it again. Don‚Äôt force it!

It's a pretty cleverly designed simple machine and it works pretty well.  There are just a few things you should know about using it.  1.  The four prongs need to be centered right over the weed or else you are just going to tear the weed apart without pulling the root.  You know you've got it when you hear that satisfying snap.  Much of the time I was just tearing up the dirt around it.  2.  Again, the key structural parts seem to be made of plastic so you need to be gentle in pulling on the shaft to engage the teeth. 3.

I don't have rocks in my yard and the ground is pretty soft. The first thing that broke was the handle separating from the metal head(picture 3) . I could work around this by putting it back on but it was a bit annoying. I was going to use some epoxy to fortify and fix it but then other parts were compromised.  There are some plastic interior parts and the head starting having problems returning to their working position without me doing it manually. At this time it is locked up and I cannot get them opened back up. The back foot lever on mine starting cracking(image 3). I did not aggressively yank or anything..it just started cracking with pretty normal and careful use(Image 4).Conclusion.  I am going to return this one and order another one and see if things go better.  It works amazing when it is not broken.  It make weeding fun...even therapeutic.

The 3-claw is heavier and seems sturdier as the part you step on is constructed of mostly metal compared to the 4-claw which is more of plastic. The 4-claw is made of aluminum and the 3-claw of stainless steel so that may also contribute to the lighterness of the 4-claw. I've used both to pull weeds in my yard. My conclusion is the extra claw makes a difference! The 4-claw gave me a higher success rate and took less effort because of the lighter weight. I was concerned with durability of the 4-claw but that hasn't been an issue. I will update if that changes.P.S. I wound up returning the Target 3-claw version.

One important thing to remember in using these type weed pullers - the ground needs to be moist - very moist - if you want to have more ease in pulling up weeds.  We have combination caliche dirt which is already a problem because it is a very dry dirt that requires plenty of moisture.  Thank God we have had several rain showers to loosen up the soil.  The tool works well for a while and then it starts getting a little stubborn when you are trying to release the weed from the claws.  Sometimes the slider gets stuck and won't move until you put the tool back in the ground and step on the foot lever.  I have had to do this at least three times in a row to get the slider to release and work properly.  I have not yet had an issue with the plastic cracking.  You should not put a whole lot of pressure on the tool when you are putting it in the ground - if the ground is soft that will help alleviate that problem.  I recommend this tool because I have not yet found anything that comes up to its standards, but some improvements could be made on strengthening up the slider handle so it will stop getting stuck.

Another method is to eject the clump straight into a bucket of water.  I can then sit on a bench and swish out the soil before adding the plants to the compost bin.

Big ones come out with a bunch of roots (some get broken off) and usually not a whole bunch of dirt. It does take a bit to get perfect aim at the weed but once you do it will get pulled out.

Handle is a bit irritating as it tends to dig into your palm a little, the ejection mechanism works well also and makes it easy to discard pulled weeds from the tool into the bin with ease.

The problem is that parts of this device is made of plastic - which cracks.  I used this weeder a moderate amount - probably once a week throughout the summer.  I didn't abuse it - I kept it clean and dry and in a garage.  I read the other reviews from people who reported that it broke, so I tried to use it gently.  By Autumn the plastic near be weeding head had cracked and it no longer worked.I thought about buying a new one this year - but it isn't exactly cheap.  This is really a shame because when it works it does a great job of pulling weeds without a lot of effort.  If they would only substitute metal for the brittle plastic parts that crack I would buy another without thinking twice and gladly pay more.I'm not the only one who has had this problem, so maybe the manufacture will listen to our feedback.

I've yet to modify mine, or even really look to see if I can, but I just don't agree with the design of the handle. I think the low side should be on the foot side, and the high side away from you for a more ergonomic feel.

Weeding is a terrible Sisyphean task and this somehow makes it, if not fun, certainly tolerable. Plus it's quick. I could fill a 5gal. bucket full of crabgrass weeds in 10-15 minutes.Operation is simple. I like that I can set a bucket down and weed in a fairly large circle around it. Once plucked, you can kind of ""shoot"" or throw the weed at the bucket, and it's easy to be accurate(ish). It reminds me of a pump shotgun in reverse. Bring along another bucket with soil to fill the divots.

It looks like it would work one way, but it's not the same as you'd guess.  Take the time to watch how the jaws close together.

But, being the creative, self-proclaimed handyman that I am, I said, there has to be a way to fix this...So i had to determine what went wrong before I came up with a solution.  So...heres how it works....the rear tooth, pushes into the front tooth, which then pushes into both the left and right teeth.  This is the mechanism that allows all teeth to grasp the weed, right.  Well, I found out the rear tooth that is supposed to start this whole function was ""sliding off"" the  front tooth, therefore it never engages the rest of the teeth; hence, the left and right go limp.As you can see in my pics, I just got two dimes, and placed them as indicated.  This fills the gaps, and removes the ""play"" of the teeth, and aligns everything so when the mechanism closes, everything is aligned, and nothing ""slides off"" .  So far so good.

My one complaint is the eject feature.  There is no tension or spring in the pedal or the eject handle and that makes it crazy easy to eject but also allows tri-blades to easily close prematurely.  This happened a few times while I was trying to position the tool over a particularly awkwardly placed weed and it seemed like there was such a simple design fix.

The weed remover that slides up and down the shaft is constantly being pressured by the metal parts when you bend the weeder handle to pull the weeds out and eventually, guess what?  Yes, the plastic part bends and snaps....  I would gladly pay $10 more for this weeder if it came with a metal weed remover part instead of the plastic one and it would have got 5 stars if it was metal.  It will work, as I said above, after this breaks but come on Fiskars, surely you know this will happen and I am sure this would break eventually even if you only used it for dandelions because of how the mechanism works when you bend the footplate to pull the weeds.

It works great on weeds with thick root balls or long, somewhat thick to thick tap roots in open soil. It requires a substantial crown and/or thick root to grasp in order to work well.  It does not work well on very small weeds, weeds with small root structures, areas with many small weeds in close proximity or any weeds that are protected by pavement or by being too close to desirable plants.  This includes turf.  It will tear a hole in turf.  Use it for dandelions, nut-sedge and other clumpy weedy grasses with lots of fibrous roots.  Dandelions have a long tap root and many people think that pulling off the top they will be rid of the weed, but it will always grow back.  This is true of almost any weed with a tap root.  If you don't get 90% of the tap root, it will come back stronger and thicker each time it is damaged by pulling.

It becomes much easier to break on harder ground due to plastic foot petal and cheap plastic ejection mechanism. And 2) because of they used plastic parts on a yard tool that's used for digging into the ground. Would you make a shovel, hoe or a pick-ax out of plastic? I don't think so. If it was made out of full aluminium metal construction it would be worth 10 stars. Even if it was thick solid plastic it would be strong enough to handle normal abuse. I would be willing to pay extra for it (within reason of course). But because you have to be so careful due to plastic parts (you've seen the pictures of broken plastic from other buyers) you may have to water your grass until it's soaking wet to soften it up a bit before use. After the yard is good and soft after a rain shower it will work so good that in most cases you wont even have to use the plastic foot pedal. You can just push it right into the ground and lean it over and up comes the root.

Here's the story:My backyard is all dirt, which I read before ordering, could pose problems for this tool. The claws couldn't penetrate the dirt to grip the weeds, so it failed, understandably.Several reviewers claimed that you needed to go out after a rain or simply wet the area that weeds were being pulled from, to get it to break the surface and pull the weeds, which also failed miserably. The wet dirt turned into mud, which completely removed the friction that would allow for the claw mechanism to grip the weed to remove it. It would simply slide right up the weed, removing the stems, and keeping the root intact.So both tests failed very badly. I can only imagine that this would only be ""successful"" on grass, after a rain, but I'm still not convinced. The gripping/claw mechanism didn't close tightly enough to grab anything but a massive stalk, rendering it useless for the average weed. The ejection slider didn't lock into place, which resulted in it sliding down and preventing the tool from working properly. This wouldn't be an issue if you could hold it up comfortably, but when you're over 6 feet tall, it's too low to hold up, without bending your back, which nullifies the reason for purchasing this tool in the first place.I love Fiskar and have many of their tools, but this one was an absolute train-wreck and set me back on my project 2 days, waiting for a more effective tool to arrive.",A Complete And Utter Disaster From Start To Finish.,Style: WeederVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,

We use it to pull mostly dandelions and sticker (thistle) plants. I just have one suggestion for the manufacturer. Consider making the claw/teeth that go into the ground deeper/longer. These weeds have evolved to grow very long strong tap roots. If you don‚Äôt pull out the weed while it is young and small, it snaps off at about 1.5-2 inches below ground, leaving the base inch or two of tap root still growing. The entire weed will regenerate from that root snippet within a few weeks. Therefore I think a longer claw would go deeper and pull more out. We do repeat pull some of the same weeds over and over again in our yard. We have very hard clay type soil though and when its dry, it is very difficult to pull anything out of.

Not too much, a little smaller than a golf ball. So, for big dandelions you do want to step on it and push it all the way in to get a good grip on that taproot. It is so satisfying to pull out a dandelion and an entire foot long taproot with it. With this method though, you will be grabbing some soil too and leaving a small hole. However, when pulling a small dandelion, you don't need to go so deep. I just give a little shove into the ground with my hand, never even step on the peddle, and that is deep enough to pull out the small ones with virtually no soil coming with it at all.

I recommend a thorough watering of the lawn before using this product. A good test is to take a 6"" screwdriver and plunge it into the turf. If it goes in easily, the ground is moist enough. If it's difficult to push the screwdriver in, you need to water the lawn more.

I am 75 years old and have a bad back, so bending over and pulling out those nasty weeds are not my cup of tea. Usually, I was only able to break them off at the soil line, leaving the roots behind to sprout again. I'm having so much fun with this weeder. My mail-lady and my next door neighbor have both asked for a demonstration. I guess giggling like an idiot attracts attention. Use it with care, because the foot thingie is plastic. I think that most of the complainers who broke it probably tromped on it.  Anyway, enjoy.  I'm about to go out and pull some more weeds! And, I'm smiling about that. (Oh, I will repeat what others have said about using it when the soil is soft, like after a rain... if you normally have hard-baked soil.

This handle doesn't give you much leverage for when you're pulling up those big thistles with the long tap roots. It doesn't feel like you can really put your weight behind it, but my other one broke on a rock and a working weeder beats a broken weeder any day, no matter what kind of handle it has. So obviously, I use it on those big, gnarly thistles- the kind that reach out and bite you from a foot away. It gets a good grip on that root and you can pull it out then open the jaws directly into the compost bin without touching that meanie. It's also good on dandelions (the big ones), and various other annoying and prickly weeds. I wouldn't want to not have one. But I really wish they had that D handle still. Be careful on rocky soil though- I broke my last one by picking up some rocks with the weed and then applying enough leverage that it bent the forks in a way where it gets stuck. Hmm maybe the D handle gave me too much power and that's why the thing broke? Well anyway, I highly recommend these if you've got long-rooted, mean, big, tough old weeds.

So these four steel forks go almost 3 inches into the ground when you step on the pedal directly over crabgrass or other weeds. Then you lean the pole towards the pedal ,the pedal clamps down on the weed roots below ground level and at the same time it gives a mechanical advantage as far as pulling the weed up a short distance just enough to break the bond with the earth. Most of the time that's all it takes and maybe a little more twisting and an otherwise stubborn weed is easily removed. Typically no twisting is necessary at all. Once you have the weed on the end of the tool you push the extract lever forward and the weed drops away into whatever container you want to use for disposal.I would give this thing six stars if I could. I would say it's close to 90 percent efficient. Something to note however, if your crabgrass is a little bit nebulous, you may have to lean over and feel out where the dead center is going into the ground before you use this thing, otherwise it could take multiple attempts. Another word of wisdom. When you lean back where the pedal is grabbing the hardy weed root, the soil is very dry, and you feel quite a bit of resistance, rather than bend something it would be better for you to try it again 180 degrees from the previous position. I very seldom encountered this condition.

The specific type of weed I targeted appeared to be annual ryegrass, which formed ugly clumps that grew much more quickly than the bermuda.The Fiskars weeder was simple to use at first: 1) locate a weed, 2) place the weeder base above the weed, 3) step down hard, 4) pull the weed out of the ground, and 5) eject it from the weeder claws.  I eventually discovered that pulling the weed out of the ground was a bit tricky on the annual ryegrass clumps since the roots on them sometimes reached 5 inches long.  The process requires you to press down on the horizontal piece of plastic and use a lateral motion in order to leverage the needed force to uproot the weed.  After using this for perhaps a few weeks, I discovered that there was a part in the weeder mechanism that would ""slip"" which made it difficult to pull weeds out of the ground.  Eventually, the plastic piece ended up breaking in one or two areas, thus causing the weeder to become nearly useless now.Keep in mind that I made only light to moderate use of this weeder on my lawn for about a month and a half before it broke on me after using it for about a month and a half.

Fiskars Root and Weed Remover VS Garden Weasel REVIEW: Fiskars are worth the every penny.  I did a head to head test on 20 deep root weeds and this product does the best job hands down and with very little damage to the ground.  Yes the Fiskars removed the weed and its entire root nearly 85% of the time.  Weasel will get the whole root out but only 60% of the time.  Which may work for Bryan Fantana but in my yard that means these will grow back.  The biggest difference is on the 2nd attempt to remove the weed & roots the Garden Weasel really ripped up the ground making 2.5"" deep holes ripping up existing grass roots and tearing up the yard with limited results on actually removing the root left behind.  The Fiskars root remover clamps around the root and removes it with accuracy and does very little damage to the surrounding grass which means you can repair the hole very easily too.  Almost can't tell when the you are done with the Fiskars. With the Weasel you have to do a good bit of work to try to replant the chunk of earth it removes and leaves a VERY noticeable mark on every root you try to pull.Top it all off with saftey.  The weasel requires you to stand on one foot and use the other to step on the tool to uproot the weed.  Which sounds easy but if you are old you may fall.  The Fiskars can be used with one hand and both feet planted firmly on the ground.  You just place it over the weed and press it into the ground using your foot if needed to really go deep then pull back.  No dangerous balancing act.  Simple and safe for older or less balanced people.Top it all of with the metal the Weasel is made with bends if you pull back on it.  Disappointed it bent on my first 8 times using it.  It just isn't as good a Fishers.  I got an 11' root out!  It clamps around the root and pulls it straight up and out.",Fiskars VS Weasel,Style: WeederVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,

I wanted to pull the haole koa weeds in my yard before they grew into trees.  I can pull the smaller ones faster with standard sized pliers (albeit having to hunch over).  I wanted this to pull the slightly larger weeds that I couldn't pull with the pliers.  These single stalk weeds have about a 1/2 inch diameter trunk and a main root shooting about 9 inches into the ground.  (Once the trunks get to be about 1"", I know I need a pick or axe.)The weak point is the orange ring at the base just above the stainless steel teeth and foot lever.  I thought the plastic foot lever was going to break first, but in both cases the plastic ring holding the 3 teeth together broke first.Yes, yes, lifetime warranty blah, blah, blah,...UPS shipping from Hawaii back to the mainland is about $50 due to the odd shape of the package.  Amazon ate the 1st return shipping cost (refunded me $50 and sent me a new one, 5 stars to Amazon!), but I just threw the 2nd one away after the orange ring cracked again.  I'd pay double the price for this if the orange ring were made of stainless steel and the foot lever was beefed up (probably the next weak point).Still, it is a back-saver if you don't want to bend over to pull weeds and the weeds aren't that strong (hence 2 stars vs 1).  The fact that the 3 teeth can grab hard enough to crack other parts of the tool is a testament to it's overall design (but not materials).

It's easy to use, ergonomically it's good, and it's pretty sturdy for its light weight. I considered giving it four stars for sturdiness, but considering its light weight, I decided it rated five stars.It arrived at high season for dandelions, and there were plenty in my lawn. I immediately started using it daily until the dandelions stopped blooming. It's fun to root out a weed and then shoot it into the basket. There are some important things to know to use it most effectively. First, you have to position it so the crown of the dandelion plant is centered within the four spikes. It's easier to use when the ground is moist. Sometimes it doesn't pull the weed out -- not sure why, but occasionally it doesn't get a good grip on the root -- and in those cases, I use my handy-dandy Hori knife to pry out the dandelion. It leaves little divots in the lawn. Sometimes I shake the soil back into the hole, sometimes I fill it with compost, sometimes I leave it. Now in its third season, the ejector has become a little sticky and sometimes I have to use my foot to give the pedal a smart rap to eject the weed. It doesn't do well in rocky soil or where there are thick woody roots. I'm okay with all of these things. It does what it is made to do well, and when it gives out, I will immediately replace it.In two years -- three seasons, really -- my dandelion problem has dwindled remarkably. My MO is this: daily, or almost daily, I make the rounds of my lawn and garden beds, looking for dandelions, and rooting them out as I go. Doing it frequently is key because once pollinated, the flowers go to seed quickly. The flowers open throughout the day, so I usually wait until midday or afternoon to do my digging. Now, after two years' vigilance, it's become a pleasant quarter-hour task.It works best on dandelions, but I've also used it successfully on wild onions, plantain, and small dock plants, although those usually require followup with the Hori.If you're looking for a non-chemical method to control dandelions, this does an excellent job.","When this one wears out, I will buy another",Style: WeederVerified Purchase,,

No matter how hard I worked, my beautiful green lawn was slowly turning as yellow as hers. I don't like adding unnecessary chemicals to my lawn, but the lack of precipitation had left my lawn stressed and ill-equipped to fight the dandelion onslaught from next door. Unable to keep up with the back breaking labor of digging the little bastards out by hand, I went looking for a solution. The Fiskars Uproot did the trick. Be warned though, this device will pull a big chunk of turf out of your yard. Strong surrounding grass will quickly resolve that problem, but a yard that's in trouble will mostly likely show the marks for longer than you'd like. Also, the bigger the weed the more turf you'll lose.I will admit, I almost gave this product 3 stars because you have to get it in exactly the right place in order to actually ""remove the root"". What happens most often is that you miss the root entirely, or the root snaps off an inch or so down. This means the weed will be back in a matter of days. I decided however that it deserved the 4th star because it's so easy to use; if you didn't get the root this week, you'll likely get it next week.I have no problems recommending the Fiskar Uproot to anyone with a weed here or there, or combating a weed problem.","Not 100%, but close enough.",Style: WeederVerified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,

I used it after a good soaking rain, and I‚Äôm sure it would work much better in damp ground than dry ground. (Fiskars makes two models of this tool, one with three claws, one with four. Mine has four claws, which I suspect works better for grabbing the weeds.)If you watch how the tool works, once you plant the claws in the ground, a plate clamps the leaves of the weed from the top. To make sure the plate clamps (downward) on the leaves, I think you have to push down on the orange ejector handle.As other reviewers have noted, it‚Äôs important to center the claws over the weed so it can properly grab the weed. This is easiest on large weeds that spread radially from the center. Also important, pull the weed out slowly‚Äîthere‚Äôs less likelihood that the root will break off. Occasionally a weed doesn‚Äôt come out, but chances are you loosened it on the first try and can get it the second time.Several reviewers noted that the large plastic piece at the bottom could be stronger, and for some users it broke. So I was careful not to put too much pressure on this part. Note that it‚Äôs not for your foot, as you might guess, but it provides the leverage for the pulling the weed as you tilt the tool away from where the weed is.I went out just to test the tool, but it was so successful I just kept at it for about an hour and filled two large plastic buckets with weeds. I would say the tools works best for large honkin' weeds that spread 4 inches or more from the center (more to grab onto). It doesn‚Äôt seem to grab on as well to smaller weeds. This was a surprise to me: I have a certain kind of grass in my yard that grows in clumps (not crabgrass). I don‚Äôt know what it is, but the blades are thicker than my lawn grass, and it‚Äôs just ‚Äúunsightly.‚Äù I found that if I could center the weed puller over a clump and grab it with the clamp, I could usually get the whole thing out, because the roots are not that deep. So usually I could pull these clumps out whole, without pulling out the desirable grass. This was amazing.Several reviewers said it leaves holes in your lawn. I found that usually the holes were not that big, but if you pull a really big weed than you‚Äôre going to have a big hole. Better to have a hole you can fill with soil and grass seed than a big ugly weed!Finally, my new lawn is pretty rocky. If you hit a rock, you can‚Äôt grab the roots and the weed, so in that case you might was well just move on.I salute whoever invented this contraption. It works! Glad I bought it.",It's great!

My yard is rather hard and dry, and the weeds are rather tenacious, but why would I need a special device to pull weeks if they were easy to pull?  If you can't easily pull a weed by hand, this device isn't going to be able to pull it either. I imagine it may work well for dandelion pulling in a lawn, or small weeds in really soft, moist, earth, but I would not recommend it for a dessert landscape.

I was at my sister in law's house and she has a gorgeous lawn.  She spotted a dandelion in her yard and ran to the garage and came out with this thing called ""The Ground Hound"" that just pulled that dandelion out slick as can be.  I thought, ""I gotta have one of these"", went home, and got on Amazon.com.  I found it, along with this Fiskars Deluxe Stand up Weeder.  That other thing was over twice the price and to pull the dandelion out you had to pull up on this knob that was kind of difficult.  After watching the demo video I ordered this Fiskars on Sunday and it came at noon on Tuesday.  I tried out my new toy and it's just amazing how this thing works, just place it over the weed, step on the pedal, and pop the weed right out.  The hardest thing is dragging around the garbage can to put all the weeds into.  In just 2 1/2 hours I filled 2 30 gallon garbage cans and my front yard is completely dandelion free now.  Tomorrow I work on the back and side yards.  Here's a little tip:  Some people complain that this thing broke right away.  This is plastic, not solid steel.  Step on the pedal and gently rock the handle back and forth to loosen the weed and then give the handle a good push and out pops the weed.  Just like any other tool it has its limitations.  Abuse it and it'll break.  This thing is so easy to use I'm going to keep it, and a 5 gallon pail, on my zero turn mower to get those devils that pop up later and I won't even have to get off the mower to do it.  I just wish I'd known about this fantastic tool years ago.  It's fun ,easy, and, like the demo video says, you might want to do all the lawns in the neighborhood.  Buy it.  You'll love it, too.

I like the principle of what it's designed to do. It's very simple to operate.  Place or stab the weed right smack in the middle with the metal blades and step down on the lever. That will force the blades to come together and then you just lift the weed right out. Pump the handle once using the slider (you see in yellow) and that releases the the weed)  Repeat the process.  Of course you end up with the weed that shows to be one place, but the root comes from another place, but you are determined to get it.  Somewhere in the process you hear a snap when you step down on the lever and when you check what it was, you don't see anything, so you continue and you hear that snap again and it didn't feel right, you check again, and now you see it.  There is a plastic part that connects all the blades to the slider and it's that plastic part that broke.Fiskars is great at making scissors but in my opinion, failed in making this product.

By day four, the ones that were hiding were easy to spot from a distance. The larger ones often came out with almost 8 inches of root attatched. If you grab weeds right in the center, the claws grab on four sides and using the foot as leverage, evenly pulls up the weeds root and all. With the relatively soft ground, I never had to stomp the tool into the ground. I simply shoved it down and leveraged it out with my arms. I don't know how well the composite would hold up to really hard ground like clay for instance if repeatedly stomped and pried on to remove weeds. If your ground is even relatively soft, this thing is a breeze to use and very fast as well. The ejection mechanism is what makes is super fast.

A lot of people posted about dandelions, but here in the South, we don't have that problem so I was a little apprehensive about this thing working on hardened Southern weeds. I have to say it does well on weeds with a defined center or clump. It works well on crabgrass or whatever (I'm still working on the identification part). My main problem in my yard is bahiagrass. There aren't a lot of herbicides that kill this stuff without killing the whole yard so I bought this to help me pull it out. It doesn't work well with large masses of bahia grass mainly because the bahia grass spreads out and it is hard to find the central root. Bahia grass does not have a tap root like your typical dandelion. In other words, it doesn't work well on bahia grass but I am still trying to figure it out.As far as any other weed in my yard, it does an excellent job if you use the tool correctly. The handle is a little short and I'm not worried about it breaking since it has a lifetime warranty. My only concern about the warranty is that it says it was imported by Fiskars Canada and to contact them with warranty issues. Welp, I'm not in Canada!

I was using the painful method, on my knees, small crowbar and depending on the size of the crabgrass and how deep its roots are, it would take me from 5 to 10 minutes to take it out... each!!So I found the Fiskars Uproot Weed and Root Remover...I don't care how long this has been around, I just know one thing...it's what I've been looking for.As I mentioned above, my main pain on my butt has always been crabgrass, reason being, my neighbor doesn't take care of his lawn, and so it is covered with them, somehow they end up on my yard and each year is the same pain for me to get rid of them...UNTIL NOW. So let me give you a simple tip for removing crabgrass (trust me, this afternoon I removed about 20 of them):You want to make sure you know where the root ball is, so spread out any actual grass around the weed and follow the weed's branches; Crabgrass is tricky, you may think you have the Fiskars lined up to the center of the weed, but you may be wrong, crabgrass tends to flatten as it grows, and so the root ball is always off from what you may perceive as the ""center"" of the weed; after moths of being plagued by this pain in the butt weed, I've noticed that its roots are usually spread out, so even with this wonderful tool, you'll most likely have to go in twice or even three times to remove a single crabgrass bunch. However, the younger the weed is, the less roots it has and those usually take only one time with the Fiskars, again, if you first locate the root.Of course, not everything is perfect, and here are a couple of cons about this tool:First, a mix of plastic and metal construction. I heard and felt some straining on the tool when I was removing a very mature crabgrass, but luckily, the tool did not break.Second, and this is more of a WARNING than a con. Since you are removing the weed entirely with its roots, you will leave a HOLE in the ground, more even so when removing crabgrass, since its roots are a mix of curled up hardened roots (again, depending on maturity). So be ready to fill up the holes with dirt. If you have an infestation, I suggest you get some grass seed, some soil and patch up any big holes you leave behind.Other weeds such as dandelions and leafy weeds are easily taken out without much of an impact on the ground. Needles to say, those weeds don't have a prayer...but don't get me wrong, like the title of my review says, with Crabgrass, it is trickier, but does the job.All in all, I couldn't be happier, this is a wonderful invention and has saved me the huge pain of dealing with weeds, literal pain. My back thanks you Fiskars and my neighbors even more, 'cause I don't curse anymore...if anything, they now probably think I'm nuts, since I was literally laughing as I took each weed out! ha!","Trickier For Crabgrass, But Does The Job.",Style: WeederVerified Purchase,,

I chose this version, the mid level one, for a couple of reasons.  For a small jump up in price, 4 claws are better than 3.  It would be a larger price jump up to the professional model, which is steel rather than aluminum, so naturally more durable -- but also heavier, and not only am I not as flexible as I used to be, I'm not as strong.  If you are hard on tools, though, you may want to consider the professional one.  Since the foot plate on this one is plastic, it does need to be treated with a certain amount of gentle respect -- I felt that there were several weeds I could have forced out of the ground by using enough strength that I could have broken the footplate in the process.  So if your style is heavy-handed, go with the professional model.  My style is more gentle -- I just tried a different angle, wiggled things around a bit, and POP, up came that stubborn weed, root and all.

There is always just one more weed that I didn't see before, and it would be so easy and quick to get it out of the ground. That's the good part.The not-so-good part is that this thing arrived loosely packed in a huge box with a broken handle. I immediately reported it to Amazon and planned to return it with the printable return label they provided. But first, after hesitating for a couple or three days, I just had to try it out a bit (with no handle). I couldn't stop, etc. So, to make a short story shorter, I repaired the handle and I now continue to use it. (I stuffed the shaft with about a foot of wood (three paint stirrers super-glued together), wrapped the break line with a strip of thin rain gutter aluminum with a bit of duct tape to hold it in place, drilled two holes one on each side of the break through the aluminum so as to bolt everything down, and then wrapped the bolts and aluminum with several layers of duct tape to protect my hands against sharp edges.) So far, so good. The handle is solid.Some advice: Do not force-pull this thing after you grab a weed. You may also have grabbed a tree root so that the weeder will break before the root does. Secondly, don't stomp hard on it if it won't go into the ground to grab the weed. There may be tree roots or rocks or whatever that you will have to work around (or use some other tool). This tool requires a light touch, but the wonderful sight of dead weed carcasses all over your lawn after just a few minutes work (I think it was just a few minutes) is, well, enough to make this thing addictive.",Addictive.

I'm at an age where not having to stoop over is a plus, and this thing does the job.  I've pulled dandelions with this tool every spring as soon as dandelions appear but before they have a chance to go to seed, pulling maybe 30-40 a day for a few days until they cease coming up. It turns into a search and destroy mission until there simply aren't any coming up anymore.It definitely works better after a rain or when the soil is moist, as this allows a better chance of actually pulling out the entire tap root.Getting the entire tap root is always the goal, and it made pulling dandelions almost fun seeing if you can ""win"" by pulling out a nice long tap root. It pays to get down and trace the dandelion stem to find the exact location of the center of the plant in order to position the tool over it properly. They you have to be sure to tilt the handle to close the claws around the root and sort of tease it out. When you actually pull out an entire long tap root along with the plant, it's a good feeling because it's one that won't be coming back.  Unfortunately, this only happens about once out of every 50 pulls, a little more often if the soil is moist or the soil is loose. But most of the time, you'll get the entire plant and at least part of the main root.","An effective tool, and no stooping. Beats digging them with hand tool.",Style: WeederVerified Purchase,,

It is built well, very sturdy, but also lightweight!!All you have to do is stick it in the center of the weed, step on the ‚Äústepper‚Äù with your foot, and kinda bend it down, and the entire weed PLUS THE ROOT just comes up!!This will save you so much time and energy when it comes to pulling weeds!! We have a LARGE yard that is literally just FILLED with weeds... I don‚Äôt even think we have grass at this point to be honest lol but this has helped clear so much of it!! Everyone in my family loves it and we all fight over it because it‚Äôs so fun to use and is so satisfying!!!Seriously, if you‚Äôre ‚Äúthinking‚Äù about it, stop thinking and just get it!!

Some of the reviews said this was best used when the ground was wet since it would give better results.  Being on the east coast and having just gotten some clear skies after the torrential downpour over the last week I had this overnighted so I could get to the weeds before the ground dried up.Simply put, I was amazed... I began having a competition with myself in my mind about what the longest root I could pull out would be, so far I think the longest one was about 10"" or so.  This sucker does the trick for sure.  I do understand peoples concern with the plastic part on the bottom.  I gotta admit that this is the weak spot on this tool, but I am sure that it could be rigged up with a sturdier implement should the plastic one break.  I never stepped on it while using the tool, though I gather some people do when reading the reviews.  Seems to me that the tool requires nothing more than to lean it back onto the plastic ""foot"" portion and use it as a pivot point.  I thought about taking off a star for the material being plastic, but I think even if it breaks and you have to replace the tool once or twice a season, you are still better off then spending a ton of money on weed n feed products that have marginal results.",Gets to the root of the problem,Style: WeederVerified Purchase,,

I tried a thing called a ""grandpa's weeder"" that may have been defective, and I rapidly tired of a jab-and-twist thing that usually didn't get the weed out.  Enter the elegantly effective Fiskars Uproot Weeder. Maybe I'll do a true timed-test run to prove my 2-second claim, it could be faster if I wanted to rush it. It takes waaay more time to describe how to set the prongs vertically over the center of the dandelion, then step firmly and briskly on the foot pedal, followed by tilting the handle back onto the foot pedal, which nicely pops the weed out of the soil, taking only a small clump of dirt along with the roots. If the soil is reasonably moist, you may pull a surprisingly long tap-root out, too. Shuck the weed with a quick pump of the sliding handle, and rinse, repeat, to your heart's content. The odd use of a self-tapping sheet-metal screw to hold the hanging display card is funny. The bubble-wrap on the prongs is a nice touch.  I haven't tried a cut tennis ball as a top handle grip, but it might make little difference. For once, I've enjoyed attacking the dandelions without getting a backache. I have tried it on a few stray grass-type weeds, and I did get out some stickery weeds, with good results, and no thorns in my fingers. I'm in no hurry to get ride of my trusty garden knife (hori-hori, of course, but this weeder has earned my unqualified recommendation. /?\']//////////","Finally, a 2-second solution to extracting dandelions!",Style: WeederVerified Purchase,,

It does have drawbacks.  It is somewhat difficult in close quarters due to the need to be able to push down on long foot pedal.  Also not sure shaft if strong enough not to crack under really heavy pulling. So if it feels like too much resistance, I back out and get smaller bite.

It would get a perfect 5 stars if it did a more consistent job of pulling out the entire root system and didn't pull out so much soil around it, but I realize that both of those are almost impossible to do.I have one of those weed wands that attaches to your hose and creates what is essential a small hydro drill, and this Fiskars Claw Weeder is way faster, way less destructive/messy, and only slightly less consistent at removing the roots of weeds.

I was in my yard doing the dreaded task of pulling weeds and broke the hand tool I was currently using. I decided to take a break before running to the home improvement store for a replacement. Lucky for me that I logged onto Amazon for a little e-tail therapy and found the Fiskars garden weeder. I read through the favorable reviews and placed my order right away. I anxiously awaited the arrival of my back-saver and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived. I tore open the box and headed outside and began my attack. Much to my pleasure it worked exactly as described. I was extremely happy with how little effort it pulled deep rooted weeds from my lawn. I pulled weeds until it was too dark to see, I know my neighbors must have though I was nuts pulling weeds in the dark but I didn't want to stop. I will say that some of my weeds were pretty big and I wound up with several ""bald"" spots where it dug up a good bit of the surrounding dirt but that's my fault for letting my weeds get out of hand. I attempted to use this on a hill in my yard that has pine straw but it didn't work quite as well. Mainly because the pine straw gets in the way and you can't get deep enough to grab the root. I also had a scare when a rock got stuck in the ""teeth"" and I had to use a pair of pliers to dislodge it. This was not an easy task so be sure to watch out for rocks. All in all me and my back are VERY happy with this purchase.",A total backsaver,Style: WeederVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,

Most of the time I can pull the entire root out of the ground but sometimes it breaks off. I have pulled some 6"" taproots out on large dandelion plants. It is strangely rewarding when getting a long root, I proudly show them off to my wife and kids. It is very comfortable for me to use, not strenuous at all. My 6 year old can even pull weeds out with it. It does pull a sizable clump of dirt with it, although I think this is worth the effectiveness of the tool.
