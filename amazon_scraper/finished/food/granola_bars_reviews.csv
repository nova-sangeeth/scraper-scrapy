However, I hate that they either contain choc chips or peanut butter. I just wish they would make them plain without add ins. If I opened one that had more than usual choc chips in them I would pick a few out. These ones I ordered from Amazon have soooo soooo many choc chips in them. Every bar I opened same thing. I wound up throwing most out because it was way too much to pick out. I’d say half of each bar consists of choc chips, if you like semi sweet choc then that should make you happy. But I hate it. The ones from the grocery store were barely acceptable but still good since I could easily take the few choc chips out but as I said, HUGE diff between regular chewy brand choc chip flavor bought from grocery store and same brand and flavor but WAY MORE choc chips.

You could reach in and grab a great- fresh bar that keeps its shape and tastes fine. Then, on the next bar, it could be barely keeping its shape, mushy, and falling apart in the wrapper. It's very annoying as it can make a real mess as it falls apart and just doesn't taste great.Rating it 3 because 50% or so are fresh and it's a great price.
