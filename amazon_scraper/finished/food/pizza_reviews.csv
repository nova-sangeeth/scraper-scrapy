I tried to cook it a little longer one time and it wasn't any better. It's better to cook this as directed and have that softer hand tossed crust. The pizza sauce has a real good fresh taste that is better than the other DiGiorno offerings. The pepperoni also is tasty and seems to be fresh as well. I like DiGiorno pizzas because they're real easy to cook and don't make a mess in your oven.,Really Good Pizza,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,18272,454,508,Public

The rising crust original one is great. The thin crust is also fantastic, probably my fave of theirs. I expected this to be more of a NY style crust. Hand tossed? This is thick and pillowy.
