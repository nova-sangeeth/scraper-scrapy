Everyone has eaten it before, and we all know what to expect. My MAJOR issue is the amount of cans that are dented in the cases. Nearly 40% of mine had to be discarded. After having worked in a warehouse as a youngster, working with lifts and loaders, I can only surmise that these cans are being destroyed on purpose. Maybe some disgruntled packer and his buds think this is funny and retributional. But, after buying many cases of various dented, more like destroyed, canned items, I have decided to no longer purchase such items. The lost/waste of my order is just too much to continue to do so. UPDATE: After further inspection I have discovered that the dented cans are found in the middle of the case of cans. This would indicate that Campbell's, in fact, packed them this way, and sold them to Amazon. This is an old trick I learned while working for a soft drink company. The question remains, did Amazon get a discount for buying these defective cans , or was Amazon duped by the Campbell's company? I no longer want to implicate the stockers at Amazon, they may be hard working people with no knowledge of what is in the case. This may in fact, be an agreement with Amazon executives and Campbell..",The waste of it all!!!,Flavor Name: Homestyle Chicken NoodleSize: 10.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)Verified Purchase,152 people found this helpful,27148,675,259,Public

Yes, there were some dented cans, but the can still burped ""safety"" when opened. The soup stock is basic Campbell's flavor which in my opinion is good. Think Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup. There are sparse amounts of small chicken squares added, then maybe half a dozen won tons stuffed with chicken.Is this restaurant quality soup? Of course not. It's a can of Campbell's soup! I've been eating Campbell's soup since I was a kid and I suspect most of the readers here are also familiar with Campbells. Campbells puts out a decent product. It has it's trademark flavor that we're used to. The Won Ton soup is a variation of that. By the way, the noddles are a bit thick compared to a restaurant won ton. But still has a good flavor. If you're wanting some won ton soup quickly, if you have a few cans on the shelf this will do the trick. Bear in mind, you're getting a good product and there may be some dented cans. SO WHAT????

At first I was totally disappointed with this Chicken Wonton Soup.  The wontons are simply two pieces of noodle attached together with nothing inside, certainly far from any wonton soup I have ever had.  The soup stock is similar to chicken noodle soup and there are some green leafy vegetables.  As I tried these can they grew on me.  Two cans of soup and one can of water worked best for me with black pepper added.  The issue is that soup is very inexpensive at Chinese takeout places and these cans are not really any less expensive but you can’t beat the convenience.

It is perfect for putting on warm in a slowcooker for 25 hours- I did this for The Sabbath because I am Jewish and I wanted to avoid cooking on The Sabbath. It actually I think tastes better the longer it sits, because the flavors have a chance to enhance and blend together. The solids (like the chicken) and the noodles are there, but not over the top. The spices and salt are perfect. Just add a can of water, and you're good to go.I am Jewish but am also very poor so I can not afford kosher meat. As the saying goes in Judaism, the body is a temple and we must treat it with respect. I don't believe not eating meat would be treating my body with respect. If you are Jewish and can afford kosher meat and have access to it, you should get it instead of this option or any non kosher meat option.

I sometimes have this soup on its own but I especially like it with pasta and it's a cinch to make. My favorite easy-easy-easy recipe is to take a can of the soup, add 1/4 to 1/2 a can of water (optional -- as ""sauce"" it's thicker without the water of course), cook it on the stovetop, pour half of it over cooked pasta or egg noodles (the standard 2 oz. UNCOOKED weight per serving), and mix well. Put in a medium square Ziploc container, snap on the lid, and freeze. (So the way I do it, I get 2 servings per can of soup.)  I usually have several of these in my freezer so if I am lazy I just grab one to take to work with me -- it heats up in the microwave in 2-3 minutes.  It makes a pretty filling lunch that is low in calories, very low in fat (maybe 2 or 3 grams per serving including the egg noodles), and quite tasty!
