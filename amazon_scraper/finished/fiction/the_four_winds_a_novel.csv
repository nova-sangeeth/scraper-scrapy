Sound familiar? It's Heartbreaking that we are fighting for the same BASIC human rights as we did 90+ YEARS AGO!!!The hardships faced by Elsa are simply relentless. Kristin Hannah wrote a visceral, richly detailed and atmospheric novel that will transport us back to the Dust Bowl and to the migrant settlements in California afterward, This is such a fascinating tale filled with captivating historical detail that gets glossed over in history books, Learning about the ""company store"" and how American citizens were forced to be basically slaves to these large farmers was eye-opening to me and I felt the desperation and hopelessness these people must have felt because they had nowhere to go and no one to turn to.By the end of this book, I cried, I raised my fist in the air.. and I also wondered Kristin Hannah has written so many great novels that one can only ponder if she can continue on the winning streak..Her writing will break you, move you, and heal you -all at once and she offers no regrets only explanations of why, how, and when she decided to choose such subjects to tackle with the upmost of respect, dignity, and courage.Kristin Hannah began writing this novel over three years ago, before the pandemic, before the skyrocketing unemployment that would follow. And yet, this story is so relevant to our current days, the isolation, dwindling funds, people, as she says in her note at the end, frightened for their future, men in power shushing voices in order to further their own desires, wanting us to pay attention to what they say and not what they really mean or what they show by their actions. Or, as the Wizard of Oz said: ’Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.’",Stunning,Verified Purchase,788 people found this helpful,,1120,37,15827,Public

Yet, I really hated the The Nightingale.And here's why...Every time I read Hannah's historical fiction, I end up feeling as though she researches like a mad woman, jots down every tragedy she can find during that time period, and then destroys her main character by making her suffer through every. single. calamity.It's too much.This book was so horribly depressing, and was so full of misery and death (animals included...it's bad, friends), that I couldn't wait for it to end. There was zero enjoyment while reading this. Yes, it's well-written, and yes, Ms. Hannah knows how to ratchet up the tension...but man, balance is a good thing. The constant darkness is overwhelming.The conclusion was completely predictable and emotionally manipulative. I know I was supposed to break down into devastated tears, but instead, I let out a huge sigh and rolled my eyes. Does that count?

I enjoyed the first part of the book, and learning about the dust bowl years of the depression. The writer brilliantly develops her characters, and seems to understand how rejection of a person by their family can contribute to the development of  the character traits we see in Elsa....the longing for love, fear of rejection in personal relationships, the hard work ethic to 'earn' her right to belong.  However. I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out the communistic spin of the book.  While I understand how the poor treatment of refugees in the 30's had to lead to the formation of worker's unions for their protection, I felt like I was being subtly conditioned to accept Communism as a good thing, and that the author was getting into some dangerous stereotypes. In the book, all the capitalists are evil, greedy people, the communists and refugees seem as pure as the driven snow.  Why is it that when thousands have come to America in the last century to escape their oppressive and failed communistic countries, we now have modern day authors seemingly promoting this ideology? Other comments by reviewers about the somewhat depressing nature of the book are also correct. There are some fine moments in the book, and the message about how love triumphs over all trials and matters above all else is a great one, but there does seem to be a lot of unrelenting misery. While I have loved the author's other books, I wish I hadn't bought this one.",Political Propaganda Undergirds Book,Verified Purchase,129 people found this helpful,,183,40,262648,Public

I was deeply moved by this novel.  I actually cried out and sobbed at the end.  I can see how Kristin Hannah was inspired by Dorothea Lange's photos of the Great Depression, especially by The Woman of the Plains.  Her descriptions of the relentless dust storms on the family's farm and the dangerous drive from Texas to California will rivet you.  Reading about the cruelty of most of the Californians already living there and the abuse of the big farm companies reminded me of our current mistreatment of immigrants in this century.  If you were a migrant from Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, or the Mid-West you were considered dirty, lazy, ignorant, contagious.  The assumption was that migrants were draining state funds and taking away jobs.  Hospitals wouldn't treat them.  They couldn't find...or afford...housing.  Eventually the state withheld relief funds altogether.  Sound familiar?  The migrants were forced onto disease-ridden plots of land to live in tents or in their old trucks.  This happened to hundreds of thousands of Americans in the 1930s.  And we didn't seem to learn much about how to treat our fellow citizens, much less our fellow human beings.  Nonetheless, the main character, Elsa, and her fierce daughter, Loreda, refused to stay silent.  Despite how painful the story is, you will not want the book to end.  I hope Hannah continues the saga through future generations of this courageous family.",Better than The Grapes of Wrath,Verified Purchase,52 people found this helpful,,71,34,278460,Public

Ironically, at the same time that Americans were struggling mightily to get through the Depression, Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin was carrying out his plan of “dekulakization,”—the liquidation of an entire class of peasant farmers as enemies of the state--in order to collectivize Russian farms and bring them under government control. “Dekulakization,” resulted in the death of possibly millions through starvation, disease, mass executions, and deportation to labor camps.

It also left me feeling uncomfortable, and I wonder if discomfort was part of Hannah’s intention in writing this story. I hope not.My parents grew up in the 30’s during the Depression and carried the mindset formed during those years for a long time afterwards. We were taught to fix what was broken or torn and not spend money to replace it. We had to turn off the lights whenever we left a room. We did not waste food. Gardens were planted, produce was canned or frozen. Credit cards were never, ever used. We girls sewed our own clothes. We had only two pairs of shoes, one for school and play and the other for church. My dad’s salary in the 50’s was only $200 per month, but we kids didn’t know we were poor. We thought that nobody else we knew went to restaurants and movies either. My mom and dad sacrificed to pay for music lessons and to take us to concerts performed by famous pianists and other musicians. Our entertainment was playing table games together every Friday night and listening to records or the radio while eating popcorn. We didn’t own a television until I was 18. We learned that we didn’t need things; we needed each other. We were loved and cared for by godly parents. “Four Winds” helped me understand what my parents went through when they were children. We were rich compared to the characters in the book.I was angered by the injustice shown in the way poor, needy people were treated by wealthy landowners in Hannah’s book. But is it fair to characterize every wealthy person as greedy and every citizen with jobs and homes as contemptuous of the destitute migrant workers? Were all native Californians inhuman? Is capitalism wicked and negligent of the needy? This is what made me uncomfortable with the plot of the story. The author seemed to be saying that socialism is what our country needs to conquer injustice. Maybe I’m misunderstanding her intent. Maybe this is simply a story of suffering and injustice and not a treatise against capitalism. Surely the author knows that not all the wealthy are greedy and not all the poor are victims.

Also, I really can not picture two women-- one from Texas and one from Alabama-- quoting George Santayana or Edmund Burke while drinking coffee as they sit on overturned metal buckets in a migrant tent city in California. As a  multiple Golden Retriever owner I can also write that while the Golden Retriever Club was founded in 1938, I don't believe that farmers in Oklahoma would have them running around on the property in 1940.

Another period of living along mud banks and working under oppressive white men is filled with never-ending indignities until alas the glorious Communists come to the rescue. It's not subtle, either, as Hannah describes the strike organizers as knights on shining armor against Capitalism- and of course the ugly duckling finds her soul mate and life calling.

If I could reach out my arms and gather them all I would.  I want to thank Kristin for writing this book of love and hope in a time that it's very much needed.  As history once again finds itself with record high unemployment and scarey unknowns, this books shows us that life continues and perseverance will prevail.A Mother's love is fierce and strong and knows no boundaries.  Elsa, the girl who couldn't be loved by her family because of her weak heart and awkwardness grows up and shows the world her strength and courage.  After being forced from her family for making a mistake, she learns about love and family from her husbands parents.  But, when the drought hits and life gets hard, her husband wants more and leaves in search of it.  Elsa once again has to pick up the pieces and protect her family.  Year after year things get worse until she has to make a choice.  Her son's life or the land that she has grown to love.  It isn't even a question.  She packs up everything and heads west along with the rest of the families in search of a better life.Along the way she finds herself.  Her strength and her courage.  A purpose that she never knew she had.  She teaches her kids the to be strong and she finds love along the way.This book was so gut wrenching.  Absolutely beautiful.  I never wanted it to end.  I loved reading about the dust bowl and the effect that it had on society back then.  I loved that just because the grass was greener didn't mean that life was sweeter.  The characters were written with such a depth that you could see them standing in front of you.  From the red silk dress, the dust storms and the hunger, the words just flew off the page with such vivid color that had me longing for more.It is really uncanny that Kristin started writing this book before the Pandemic.  Because it struck home on so many different levels.  Just the pure uncertainty of life right now.  The unemployment, families struggling.  It's really funny how history is always a huge part of our life and that it repeats itself in many different ways.  But there is always HOPE.I can't recommend this book enough.

The book details the life of Elsa and her two children as they struggle to survive any way they can through the Great Depression in the panhandle of Texas.  They are trapped the awful drought that created the Dustbowl of the Central plains of the US- through horrendous dust storms that bury crops and kill livestock.  .Elsa, whose parents see her as an undesirable weakling, finds her strength to carry on for the sake of her in laws and her children.  She and the children finally leave  the farm when it becomes apparent she must take her children elsewhere or they will die from the awful conditions- driving 900 miles to California.  In California, they find no welcome from the locals, and live from hand to mouth in a tent encampment  as she tries to find work to feed her family.  So many issues in this book relate to what is happening in the US now, and elsewhere in the world.  People fighting against the indifference of nature (Covid/drought), people trying to emigrate elsewhere for a better life and not being welcomed,  the too little too late attitude of government to relieve the suffering of those displaced by drought and financial ruin.  If you think being stuck at home because of Covid with your heat and air conditioning, your full refrigerator and indoor plumbing is rough, you should read this book.

The camps, outside of those operated by the Federal Government were crimes against humanity.I lived in the central valley of California for 15 years and heard  many ""growers"" and ""packers"" complain about the UFW. They seemed to feel labor unions would eat up the profits of the owners' risk-taking (guess  they were feeling poorly that they could only lease a ""Buick instead of Caddie"" for their wives (actually heard this from a grower). Then provided cruddy housing, poor wages, etc. for their green-carders"".  The people who do the stoop labor and get the fruit and veggies to our tables.While the book is a revisit to the Grapes of Wrath -- the real story of the book is its depiction of the strengths of women (3 generations) who fought the ""dust-bowl"" and migration west to seek a better life.

Unfortunately, even if you agree with the message, the main characters didn't feel authentic.  Their actions and decisions were made to serve the story instead of feeling organic to the character.There was a rushed quality to the writing as if a deeper edit had been sacrificed to getting the book out.  For example, the descriptions of Elsa and her relationship with her family is repeated over and over again in the first few chapters with little variation or purpose.  Her family members (parents, sisters) are cartoon caricatures.  Similarly, many of the people encountered in California are so one dimensional and cruel they reminded me of Snidely Whiplash.I was drawn to the book because I was born in Oklahoma and had close relatives who went through the Dust Bowl.

I started it as soon as UPS dropped it at my door and didn't do much else until I finished it.  It's one of the best books that I've read in a long long time.  It's a story about poverty, love and family that I will long remember.It's 1934 in Texas and the recession and drought have drastically changed the lives of the farmers.  Instead of the crops they had in the past, they now have dry fields that don't yield anything and dust storms that make their lives and their farms even more brutal.  Many farmers are losing their farms and equipment to the banks and the federal government is doing nothing to help their plight.  They've heard that California has jobs and life will be good for them there.  Many of them pack up their household goods and start the trek to California.  When they got there, they find a way of life much worse than what they left.  They are forced to live in unsafe conditions and paid a pittance for helping the rich farmers pick their crops.Elsa has to decide whether to take her children to California for a better life or stay in Texas on the family farm.  Her husband has left her and his parents are struggling to keep the farm profitable.  When her son gets sick from the dust, she feels that she has no choice and leaves to find a better life.  What she finds is a camp full of people who can barely earn the money to feed their children.  She also finds prejudice and dislike from the Californians.  Elsa never gives up in trying to keep her children healthy and fed.  She'd never felt strong or brave in her entire life but she showed bravery and love every day to try to find a better life for her family.This novel is so well researched and written that I could feel the pain of Elsa and her children.  I admired Elsa and all of the other parents who did back- breaking work to help their families in this terrible time in American history.  I'll warn you that this is not an easy book to read.  I cried more reading this book than any other book that I've read recently.  At the end the overwhelming feeling is one of admiration of Elsa as a strong and brave woman and strong hope for the future.This is a novel that I will keep  and re-read sometime in the future.

The dispirited people soldier on as long as they can until they give up and move on to what they hope is the promise of California. Ms. Hannah does a good job with the narrative in the beginning, although sometimes the descriptions of the blowing dirt and grim and sand and soil become  repetitive. In addition, we're introduced to the weak husband who can't take it and runs off, the spurned and stoic wife, the rebelling teen (who sounds far too much like a 21st century teen) and the stubborn old timers who refuse to leave the land.But the second half of the book focuses far too much on the political movements the ""Okies"" and others who emigrated to California join to demand fair wages. These turn into strikes and sit-downs that are tempered with communist sympathies, and not just around the edges. This is when the characters truly descend into parodies of themselves. The stoic wife takes on a heroic role, the teen daughter realizes how amazing her mother has been throughout the whole ordeal, the lover the spurned but stoic wife takes on is the leader of the anti-Big Farm movement, the owner of the Big Farm is grotesque physically and spiritually. You get the picture. The descriptions of life in the campsites where the ""Okies"" had to live and the terrible attitudes towards them they had to endure is also well researched but, again, becomes repetitive. All in all, I 'm glad I read the book - it had me  rereading the far superior ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and studying again what happened and why we as a country endured the Dust Bowl.

The author masterfully transports readers to the despairing days of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, and there is little reprieve for the reader and none for the characters.  The hardship is simply inexorable. This book made me realize the extent of what a human can bear and particularly the lengths a mother will go for her children.The Four Winds is uncannily prophetic of 2021 with its account of an America in economic decline suffering devastating and relentless natural disasters, its people holding contempt for those they deem inferior and the anxiety people experience at potentially being exposed to widespread contagions.  Further, it is impossible not to make comparisons between the cruel and unjust treatment of Dust Bowl migrants with the treatment of immigrants coming to America today. In all of these ways, this narrative is monumentally timely.As much as this is a tale of pain and adversity, it is also a story of the perseverance and dogged determination of the human spirit in the face of the worst circumstances imaginable. It is a story of the love, fortitude, endurance and grit of a mother who will leave no stone unturned for her family.In essence, The Four Winds is the quintessential American story, and I recommend it with five stars.

It happened to thousands of people who suffered death and destruction, and who left their land seeking a better way of life. They did not find it in most places because the U.S. was experiencing The Great Depression under President Hoover. Those who were destitute and desperate from the loss of their livelihood were treated with hostility and prejudice by others in areas of the West where conditions were not so terrible. Eventually there were strikes and violence caused by the greed of the few against the hungry and desperate American migrants. What was happening in the West during the Dust Bowl period was mirrored by the strikes and violence in Washington, D.C. for many of the same reasons.  To blame the migrants for joining forces with the American Communist organizers is short-sighted. These organizers acted much as the early Labor Unions to force employers to treat their workers with respect and decent wages.

Kristin Hannah has a way of taking me on a journey into the past and leaving me with feelings of shock, sadness, anger and more knowledge than I started with, but she's also a master at taking all of that and showing there are those who, with the courage, strength and resiliency to survive, can change their stories in history, even change history itself. Lift themselves up, carry on and show the strength of the pure human spirit when everything around them is in tatters.The Four Winds is not the book for you if you're looking for an easy read that you can just blow through (no pun intended) and say, ""Yeah, that was great."" No it's a real story of a horrible time in American history. I chose this one to read right away because it dealt with The Great Depression, it seemed especially relative to me right now. What I would call a timely book for these times. As we go through what's being labeled as the worst economic disaster since The Great Depression, I wanted to know what went on to the marginalized people of our nation in the 1930's. Historically it's the underserved, poor and devastated that suffer in times of crisis, we're seeing it happening again and I wonder will we ever learn? What's it going to take? When is enough enough?Elsa Martinelli hasn't had an easy life, her family shunned her, she just wasn't pretty enough to warrant attention from them. But it's her life after marriage that the book concentrates on. Elsa finds herself in a new town, living on a farm with her in-laws within the Great Plains of America, what will soon be called The Dust Bowl after years of drought and failing farms, hungry families, mountains of dust being blown and covering everything in it's wake and little hope for change. She's a farm girl now and calls the Plains her home, but after years of trying to live in a place where the dust is burying them more every year, crops will not grow without water and it's become dangerous for her to stay, Elsa decides to migrate West to California with her daughter and son. A feat that she never dreamed she'd be able to do. They suffer greatly trying to make it across the country in an old, broken down truck, just the three of them. I would think in the 1930's a woman alone, with only her two young children would have to have been the bravest of the brave, the determined few who would do anything to find the American dream!Once they reached the Golden State their hopes and dreams of a new home, friendly neighbors and jobs, soon becomes a real life disappointment. There are no jobs for the thousands and thousands who are like Elsa trying to escape their dire circumstances and continue with their hopes of the American dream. Soon they'll have to settle for a spot in one of the many immigrant tent cities, where Elsa is again challenged to provide for her children as best she can. She finds a job picking cotton, but then goes through the injustice of the greedy owner. Her soul is constantly being chipped away, but she persisted! The residents of California are nothing short of mean and nasty to these immigrants and won't even give them a chance. They are taunted with names, discriminated against at every turn, left to suffer on their own, but Elsa is not giving up. It's so important to her to teach her children what's important in life and try to keep them in school, education will further their dreams for a better future. This will not be an easy task for Elsa, but she's become a tougher than nails kinda gal and doesn't stop trying any more than she'd stop loving her children,After meeting up with an activist/communist who has a heart for the downtrodden and wants to help, she encounters the other side of greed. Someone finally understands the nightmare she and thousands of other families are living through. She's hesitant at first to get involved, after all he is a communist, and during the 30's that was not the label you wanted attached to your name. Elsa's daughter has grown up to be a smart, independent thinker with ideas of her own, I loved to read that teen girls in the 1930's were not that much different from the 1990's when I was going through the hell of a teenage daughter with a strong independent personality who thought she knew it all. Anyway, her daughter sees things as a simple right and wrong conversation, but the realities of surviving are left to her mom, the one whose been particular about how honest she is with her for fear of scaring the kids or allowing them to think they're less than. She's one heck of a mom in a time when trying to care for oneself is hard enough, but to raise strong, resilient children is almost impossible.This will be another book that doesn't leave me soon. Both my parents survived the Great Depression, but for personal reasons never talked much about it. Every once in a while when my dad would tell a story of his childhood I could detect from the settings he used that he was one of the very poor in the 1930's. Little food, torn and outgrown clothes, no jobs, no money and hardship at every turn, but then I listen to stories my mom told and she was of the upper class and didn't go through any of this. I've always wondered how can this be? They lived miles from one another as kids, both of their sets of parents were hard working and caring people, the difference was money. It angers me that those who have are always making the decisions for those who don't . Blame it on capitalism, racism, cronyism or any other ism you can think of, to me it all boils down to a lack of humanity towards your fellow man/woman. When does kindness, caring and assisting those less fortunate come into the conversation? Are we again going to argue over ism's and whose right or wrong, or are we going to say enough is enough and begin treating others like we'd like to be treated, you know the golden rule we all learned as kids!I love Kristin Hannah and the way she can take a story of horrible circumstances and people's struggles and turn them into a need to read novel. Her research is always impeccable and her characters are real people with real problems and desires. Their stories need to be told, even though these are fictional characters, there are millions of everyday people who can relate to Elsa's strength, determination and persistence in her quest to better themselves in a world that's never on their side. The everyman/woman we all want to see make it. Through Hannah's books we get the chance to go back in history, hear the stories and see the resiliency of the human spirit again and again. Some are saying this one is just too depressing, yes it is, but sometimes we need to be uncomfortable in our own skin to have our eyes opened. Maybe because this story is being retold all over the US right now. Greed over need, power over what's good and just. sound bytes over action. This is a timely read and one that needs to be told. I suggest also reading Hannah's acknowledgements in the back of the book, it gave me insight into how she decided to write this one, what her inspiration was and a bit about where she stands on this nation in pain. Yes folks she's done it to me again, I don't cry over books, but this really rocked me. The Four Winds will be blowing through my mind for some time to come.

I will be seeking out additional non fiction accountings of The Great Depression/Dust Bowl era. What I find difficult to understand are some of the other reviews where people state what a depressing book they feel this is/ lacking in joy, one said, and other comments regarding the political statements and references to communism. I am certainly not a believer in the communist doctrine in any way shape or form. But one can see how desperate these workers were to grasp any message that offered hope even though they did not understand fully the consequences. No one can deny that it is a basic human right to receive fair treatment. It has been and always will be that the wealthy, for the most part, are focused on their own gain. That will never change as is apparent throughout this story, throughout history and in any country. As for the book being depressing - of course it is - this was not a “joyful” time - as I read each chapter, I became even more grateful for what I have and so, so angry that we could very well go through another time such as the Great Depression/Dust Bowl era. I recommend this book as a reminder and eye opener. If there is any fault with the writing, it is that some of the sentences were repeated within a few pages of each other. It sometimes did not have the flow that occurs in other books by Kristin Hannah.

Instead, she is met with impossibly deplorable living and working conditions that are unspeakably dangerous, disease-ridden and downright cruel.I am actually scoffing about the negative reviews by those who are offended, stating the story was nothing more than ""a political statement"", that it's ""a crafted story to promote Communism"", that it's ""horribly written, pro-communist dribble"", and that its ""anti-capitalist communist crap"", etc. etc.  Their outrage all sounds the same and illustrates a complete failure to comprehend the story.I couldn't DISAGREE MORE with those reviews.

Yes, this is a story of one woman's courage and grit as she worked tirelessly picking cotton for wealthy growers and land owners who lacked compassion of any kind, continuing to line their own pockets but couldn't see fit to pay their workers a decent living wage.  Also yes, the story does indeed document the beginning formations of how the workers were forced to eventually rise up and begin forming unions.  However, forming unions and paying people fair wages is much more equated with socialism, not communism.  I realize that is how it was seen during that particular time in history but decades later, most of us know the difference, even if a few negative reviewers here don't.

Obviously both are about the Great Depression, the devastation of the Dust Bowl and the fragility of life.  Hannah's writing, as always, is excellent.  It is not hard for the reader to recall Dorothea Lange's photographs of migrants when reading about Elsa and her children, the most iconic photo being that of thirty-two year old Florence Owens Thompson, shown with three of her seven children, taken in 1936.  Often referred to as “Migrant Mother,” the picture has come to symbolize the human tragedy of the Great Depression.  The parallels of this book and The Grapes of Wrath are strongest when the story resides in the roadside migrant camps and cabins owned by the farmer, Mr. Welty.  Regardless of how hard she works, Elsa cannot escape the power that Welty has over her and her family.  While the company store seemed like a lifeline, it ultimately became the trap from which she couldn't escape.  My biggest issue with the book was its glorification (intentional or not) of communism.  The migrants who came to California were by no means communists, far from it.  They merely wanted the opportunity to work and be paid a fair wage for their labor.  It was also unclear whether any of the organizers were or had been migrant workers. It seemed they moved from one cause to the next.  I think it would be futile to suggest that the ""Greatest Generation"" had its foundations in communism, quite the contrary.  I think this book succeeds when it focuses on the family dynamic and the relationships between Elsa and her parents, in-laws, husband, and children, especially her daughter.  Ms. Hannah has again crafted an excellent story worth reading.

When growing up inside her family home, Elsa Wolcott never pictured herself married with children of her own. Led to believe she was sickly and plain, Elsa was resigned to the life of a spinster for the rest of her life. But a bold and daring move one night leads her to meet Rafe Martinelli and her world is forever changed. Finding herself in the family way, Elsa is shamed and cast from her parents home and coerced into marrying Rafe and living with the Martinellis.Life is difficult at first, but Elsa is determined to win Rafe’s love and his parents’ approval. As time goes by, Elsa becomes attached to her in-laws and they to her, as well as the two children the marriage produces. However, Rafe has other dreams that don’t include life on the farm with a family to raise. When the depression hits, followed by financial ruin due to dust storms caused by excessive drought and years of overfarming, Rafe abandons his family and farm for what he believes are greener pastures. As the years go by and the drought and dust storms continue, Elsa is encouraged to head west for the health and well being of her children. Marketed as the land of milk and honey, Elsa heads to California with her children in tow and the few precious possessions they have. Unfortunately, the living conditions are terrible at best in the migrant camps and work is scarce. With her resources starting to run short and three mouths to feed, Elsa must stand her ground and do whatever it takes to survive. The Workers Alliance uniting migrant workers to fight for fair wages and work practices seems to offer hope. But all actions have their consequences as Elsa soon finds out. The only question that remains is how much is she willing to lose in order to gain.I have read so many of Kristin Hannah’s books and like all her books they stay with you long after you finish reading them. This book put me in the same frame of mind as The Grapes of Wrath. The heartache and the struggle of families that were promised a grand life of fruitful work and good wages, only to find little work, paltry wages and unsanitary living conditions was heartbreaking. As with all her novels, her characters in this story exuded so much strength and love for one another. I especially liked Rose and Tony Martinelli, but  Elsa and her daughter Loreda were my favorite characters by far.  Their inner strength to continue living, working and hoping for a better tomorrow despite all the insurmountable odds was truly amazing. To watch Elsa’s transformation from a diminutive young woman that nobody gave a second glance to, to a strong independent woman with a heart so full of love and strength was extremely gratifying. Anyone who reads this novel will love her spirit and tenacity to survive and pass this fearlessness on to her children. The only thing I would have liked to have known is what happened to Rafe. Never seen or heard from again, I would have liked to have known his outcome.In closing, The Four Winds is a great novel worth the time to read. From the very beginning to the end, you will be caught up in the life of Elsa Wolcott Martinelli and travel with her from the Texas panhandle to the coast of California. You will cheer with her and cry with her, but most of all you will come to love and admire her.",A novel of the human spirit,Verified Purchase,,,404,227,18966,Public

One day she makes herself a red flapper dress, bobs her hair, and meets her husband.  Handsome Rafe has many dreams but settles down to raise a family with Elsa.  As the depression and then the Dust Bowl hit, the Martinelli family is hit with many difficult choices.  What will they do to survive?I loved the vivid portrait that Hannah painted of the Dust Bowl and the depression.  The very hard choices that people had to make for their family survival were devastating.  The ecological destruction wrought by the Dust Bowl helped to bring in new conservation practices that are still used to this day.  The travel from the shattered plains to California to then be treated like dirt was also heartbreaking.  People that proudly had their own farms or owned their own businesses were treated like trash and forced to live in tent cities.  The novel really humanized the situation.I LOVED the characters in this novel.  Elsa is a woman who had difficulty in self-confidence, but through the love of her children, she was able to work her hardest to survive.  I in particular loved her relationship with her in-laws and how they became her real parents.  I also loved the often-angry relationship she had with her 13-year-old daughter Loreda.  It rang as a true mother daughter relationship.  I loved that Elsa was doing her best, even when Loreda didn’t see it.I don’t want to ruin this book experience for others so I will not get further into the plot.  Like Hannah’s past few novels, I flew through this one and couldn’t put it down.  Tears were shed and emotions were felt.  I loved this novel.Favorite Quotes:“Hope is a coin I carry:  an American penny, given to me by a man I came to love.”“Passion is a thunderstorm, there and gone.”“Elsa hadn’t known until right then how much difference a friend could make.  How one person could lift your spirit just enough to keep you upright.”“Poverty was a soul-crushing thing.  A cave that tightened around you, its pinprick of light closing a little more at the end of each desperate, unchanged day.”“Life went on, even in the hardest of times.”Overall, The Four Winds is a gripping story that vividly paints the devastation caused by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl.Book Source:  Purchased from Amazon.com",Gripping Story - I couldn't put it down!,Verified Purchase,,,601,262,12203,Public

The parallels between history and our current environment both saddens and frustrates me as the fights from the 30’s and 40’s still continue today. Wealth, power, and control still remains with white men, and women are still undervalued in the workplace and society.Societal norms still label and serve to mistreat those that are less fortunate in life. What also remains the same is that women tend to meet their lot in life with integrity and grit. Mothers will still go out of their way to take care of their children, and human kindness is still the very best quality we can share with each other.

They tell her she’s too tall, not pretty, and sickly. It’s the 1920’s and women tend to be married and have children by the time they’re twenty years old and Elsinore is twenty-five. She wants a change and wants to enjoy life so she cuts her waist-length hair to her chin and buys red silk and creates a flapper dress. She sneaks out one night to go to the speakeasy in town but they won’t let her in and tell her to go home when they realize it’s her. She walks down the street and meets an eighteen-year-old Italian man who wants to have fun. They both admit they’re lonely and see each other a few times to have sex. Rafe calls Elsinore “Els”; she likes the nickname and feels wanted when she’s with him. She ends up with morning sickness and her parents disown her and her father takes her and one packed suitcase to Rafe’s family farm. Elsinore's father tells Rafe's parents what’s going on and leaves her there, stating that their family is done with her. Rafe’s parents have saved for him to go to college for a better life but he seems happy to stay on the farm with Els and says that he doesn’t want to go to college anyway. Elsa and Rafe have a girl then a boy. His parents are grateful for Elsa because she’s strong, brave, a hard worker, and a good wife and mother.

There are not many authors like Hannah around, so it is refreshing to get a new book from her every now and then.  As usual, my counsel is to not miss it.Elsa Wolcott, enters the 1920s at a stressful time for her.  After being newly married at an age considered too mature by most, times get hard in Texas.  She and her husband, Rafe, struggle on their Texas farm until 1934, when husband, worn down to a life of morbid desperation caused by poor weather and even poorer soil and failing crops, can’t take the tough life anymore, packs up and leaves for parts unknown, abandoning his equally disparate wife and two raggedy children, all of them sick and hungry.  Elsa struggles to keep it together through relentless dust storms and droughts that continue to ravish the already crusty soil, further diminishing the skimpy crops until it also becomes too much for her to handle.  She is forced to make a choice.  She will probably perish if she stays on the land she loves or she can move to golden California where life is easy and much kinder, or so she is told.  Making a hard decision, she packs their meager belongings, gathers what little money they have, and, with children in tow, begins the trek to an easier life in an old, broken-down truck.But California is not that golden.  Too many people like her have fled their horrible existence and reached the promised land already, making harsh demands on the land that can’t be met.  So now she has to continue working like a dog, picking cotton for little or no money, struggling to get food for her family, fighting the resentment of California natives over “Okies” moving in, and trying to find jobs where none exist.  Living in a huge farm worker settlement alongside a dirty water ditch, her existence is worse than before.  But she struggles on.This story is about unbending willpower.  The author has piled immense hardship on her characters and has ways of communicating the privation that will bring tears and gut-wrenching pain to her readers.  Her protagonists struggle along, dragging readers with them actually passing along their pain and discomfort as actual physical events to those that are reading about them.  Think of Jack London and his characters suffering the immense cold of below zero temperatures or tortured slaves as they suffer through their chained existence in the stinking holds of sea-tossed slave ships.  The adversity is actually physically felt by the reader.  Hannah has that kind of reality in her writing.No spoilers here.

But I was never able to FEEL my family's pain during that period.In The Four Winds, Kristin Hannah made me FEEL life during the drought and dust bowl of the 1930s, living on American land that no longer produced harvests, the hunger, poverty, and hopelessness. Her story swept me into a family who loved their land and was so strong that they would not give up on their home though it had turned to nothing but dust. Her words made me FEEL how the Great Depression left so many people out of work, how painful the decision was to finally abandon their homes and head west in hopes of finding work and a better life. Hope and love kept people going.Without spoiling the story, I quote Kristin Hannah in her Author Notes, “Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that the Great Depression would become so relevant in our modern lives, that I would see so many people out of work, in need, frightened by the future.”The Four Winds reminds us that, though world events bring hardships, there is hope and love.","Though World Events Bring Hardships, Hope and Love Remain",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,95,66,1279202,Public

When she tries to show the baby to her parents, the mother is disgusted by its darker Italian skin and slams the door on her.She comes to love and be loved by his family, wheat farmers in Texas, but when the dust storms come, her husband leaves her and their two children, headed west as did thousands, called Oakies.(So many were from Oklahoma. Reminiscent of The Grapes of Wrath.)When Elsa's little boy becomes very sick with dust pneumonia, the doctor tells her she must take him away from that environment, so she courageously drives her in laws truck across the desert and mountains with her two children to California. Nothing is as they expected. Extreme poverty, outdoor living in tents, shacks, little food, ragged clothes, mud, floods, only work is picking cotton while being exploited by land owner, spurned and humiliated by California residents, almost unbearable conditions. They become involved with a man and organization of communists who demand better conditions for the workers, call for strikes, get beaten down. and the end is so very sad it was hard to keep from shedding a few tears.But it's a wonderful book, so historically true, and might be quite relatable to the current status of our country's pandemic curse.

I’ve read the nightingale enough times to know that I didn’t get a break down on WW2 politics every other sentence.There was NO main character to this book.The main character was Politics and the weather.Literally....By the end of the book, I still didn’t have a mental picture in my mind of any character- I couldn’t even tell you what Elsa was suppose to look like other than “maybe ugly with stringy thin hair?”More words were used to describe the help of the communist and the description of the dust -over and over and over- than went into the mind or heart of any character who came on the scene.I stared at the last page for a good 30 seconds like WTF did I just read??And I hate it because this lady can write.I don’t know what happened with this book.And I couldn’t even feel anything for the characters at the end because I never got to know them at all in the 400 plus pages before she closed up the book in a really strange and awkward way.The thing is- This author wrote about Stalin’s rule and the plight of a woman from Russia with such precision that her book Winter Garden cut through my heart like a knife.To then lay out the story of a Freedom fighting sister in the Nightingale while equally telling the story of the other sister with an inner strength that was unmatched and take me into occupied France as if I had been transported there- or carry me off to Alaska in the back of a Vw van and into the Bush with a family in the Great Alone that I will never forget—Yet completely lost me in a book about America during the Great Depression.If you want to read a history lesson about the dirt, poor farming practices, dust pneumonia, selfish people, while basically  being told that communism was the only help for the poor people in California or that the leader of the communist instigators  at that time would get bashed over the head and while bleeding would tell a woman to grab his mic and keep talking while the big bad capitalists wolves with all the money gunned the people down and beat and killed them- then here is your book.🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️",So disappointed 😔,,33 people found this helpful,,61,2,3368440,Public

My family did not grow up during the era of the Great Depression or the Dust Bowl. However; the delineation of the Martenelli family to my own family was uncanny.

The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah is an exceptional story of perseverance, resilience, empathy, strife, love, and the ever-powerful meaning of courageousness. Kristins’ words painted pictures of a life full of unbelievable circumstances, and yet she was able to encapsulate the very essence of survival.

What I found instead was simply a very historically accurate fictionalization of events that occurred all over California in the midst of the Great Depression. No matter the semantics used, call it workers rights, human rights, socialism or communism, the issue remains the same. The book demonstrates that history has shown us time and time again that unfettered greed knows no boundary, be it skin color, nationality, sex, or class. Hannah shows that the rich will turn on their fellow Americans and allow them to starve with the same ferocity to protect their profit margins that a mother will protect her children. I think Hannah did a good job of trying to introduce the horror of the Great Depression and what it meant for regular people for some readers that typically wouldn’t read anything that didn’t have the heroine drinking out of sparkling wine glasses or worrying about how their rear ends look in yoga pants. It’s not a fun read, and I can see where this book makes people uncomfortable in the sense of “oh, we don’t talk about those times”, because some readers seem quite uncomfortable with the idea that poverty is something that they are immune to, all while living in it.  This book will dash the idea that if you just work hard enough, anything is possible for all people who are worthy of decent treatment based on their birthright as an American. If you want to widen your perspective a little, and learn something about the ugly history of America, and maybe use this as a book club book this is for you. If you are made uncomfortable by the thought that poverty is a tool used by the rich to stay rich is a real thing, this book is most likely not for you. Readers already familiar with the history of the US and accustomed to more complicated ideas will not be overly impressed by the narrative of the main characters.

Kristin Hannah’s “The Four Winds” is easily my favorite read so far this year. If you want an emotionally gripping page-turner with an incredible female protagonist, then this is your book—and if you enjoy historical fiction, even better. The story follows Elsa and her struggles as a mother during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl of the 30’s. The hardships she endures are beyond comprehension and she is soon faced with the decision to set out west and leave the land she loves or stay behind and hope things get better. The decision is soon made for her when one of her children almost dies after a storm. This book is a gentle reminder of the true hardships people faced during that generation—hardships that make our current situation look painless. If you are looking for feel good fluff, this isn’t for you. And to write a book with these circumstances being anything but gut-wrenching would be a disservice to the people who survived these times.

Going into it, I knew it would tug at my heartstrings for three reasons—it’s about the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl in Texas, Hannah’s books ALWAYS make me emotional, and I read a few reviews.The Four Winds reads like a saga with a mood of resilience, the struggle to survive during endless tragedies, and frustration over the desire for things to get better. Hannah is an expert at writing about relationships. In this book, the female relationships resounded for me. There was so much love and strength between: Elsa and Rose, Elsa and Jean, and Elsa and Loreda. The courage of a mother with unyielding love for her children was beautiful as well.Although fiction, The Four Winds is written with such realism that it provides an informative story about this period in US history—depicting issues of class struggle, prejudice, poverty, migration, and messages on what it means to be American.

And her creation of family bonds and backstory is probably my very favorite part about her writing. I have loved most all of her books but this one fell flat for me in so many ways. First the ending of this book, without spoiling it, it honestly felt like it was rushed. She spent so much time developing this story so deeply and then the last 2 chapters just felt incredibly sped through. Also, while most can appreciate listening to other’s opinions on politics and don’t mind opposing views, I wasn’t expecting or wanting to read over and over again about politics at all. I read fiction as a mental break from the crazy world we live in, I know others feel the same. Lastly the tone of the story was incredibly disappointing. I feel like Hannah greatly missed an opportunity, in her choice to write historical fiction, to show the great ability of humans to overcome adversity. If she had dug deeper and maybe spent some time in person in the Central Valley instead of just reading about it in books, I think she would have found many stories of families who migrated during the dust bowl and while they faced extreme hardships came out to actually be very successful and even very wealthy families in the generations that followed. Many as very successful farmers and business owners. As someone who has lived and worked in the California AG community in the Central Valley, I can tell you if you take the time to talk to some farmers and ranchers you will find many with very amazing family history rich with hardship, perseverance and success. THAT kind of a story is something we could have all used to inspire right now and is actually more realistic than the tale that was weaved. I wish Hannah had showed us a family like that, instead of one who fled back to the south and blamed the government for all their problems.",Miss the old Kristen Hannah books,Verified Purchase,,,8,12,9386225,Public

I have read many books focused on the Holocaust, world wars, but few books that focused on American historical events. I read this book quickly despite my demanding schedule.  The book pulled me in, maintained my interest, and focused on a period of history in our own country with hardships most of us have never endured. I appreciate the research and interviews that clearly formed the backbone ofMs. Kristin Hannah’s writing. It’s not light-hearted or easy reading as some have commented.  That theme is not the purpose of this book. It is a story of a fictional family that went through true American historical events less than a century ago. My maternal grandmother was abandoned by her husband during the depression and she was left with two young daughters - one of them my mother.  My grandfather’s (who left) family took them in just as in this book. I feel that this book expanded my awareness of why my heritage is from a long line of strong and independent women - because they had to be. Thank you Ms. Hannah.
