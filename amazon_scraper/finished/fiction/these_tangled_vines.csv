One of the wonderful things about Italy is the food. the food these people ate was decidedly un-italian, further, there was even a comment about pasta being all carbs and fattening.  So these non Italians are in Italy, and they're not eating Italian food (at least they are apparently drinking a LOT of Italian wine) and they have their little family drama which is very implausible. The perfect father, a paraplegic was actually an egocentric self serving jerk who totally starved the hopes out of his wife, the protagonist's mom, who died of cancer ten years before the story starts, while her star crossed lover, the protagonist's father languishes in his Tuscan Vineyards completely hidden from the protagonist until he dies and leaves her the whole farm.  Her unpleasant half siblings are awarded a house in England, but they aren't happy with that and when the brother threatens to fight over it, our protagonist just buys him out for her new half sister! I mean, really, that's what strangers do, right, hand over 1/2 a million (a million? who knows?) pounds so the self serving half sister won't be sad.

This sets her world on edge, and nothing will be quite the same again. After the heroine goes to Tuscany, the author peels back the layers of the heroine's mother's life during that fateful summer in Italy in the mid-1980s as well as shows its rippling effects and consequences far into the future, including legal and emotional battles. I love well-done dual plotlines that seamlessly pirouette together, the happenings in one shedding light on the other. The author's descriptions of Italy, and particularly the food, put you right there. Fiction is a great way to armchair travel (our best travel option during this time of global crisis), and this one helps you do so while engaging you with the many tangled vines of the story. As the lies and secrets get untangled, we come to see that the story is not only about a profound love but also regret, healing, and forgiveness.

It feature Kate Bell whose mother died 12 years ago, when she was 18. At that time she took over responsibility for her father, who is a quadriplegic and needed round-the-clock care. On her deathbed, Lillian, Kate's mother, confessed that she had been fathered by a man other than her husband, Fred Bell. She also made her promise to never tell Fred: it would devastate him. So she had soldiered on, sacrificing many things that normal people had, all to care for her father. One day she got devastating news: her natural father, Anton Clark, had died and had left her property. Could she come to Italy? It turns out that he was a fabulously wealthy man. He owned multiple homes as well as this lovely vineyard near Tuscany. He had split the other things, as well as some money between his two other children, but he had left the vineyard and wine production to her, as well as a load of cash. She didn't know what to think. Her half-siblings were not happy, and really, not very nice. She still had her father to think of. What would she do with an Italian vineyard? Her half-brother, Connor, was threatening to try to break the will. There was no proof that he had really meant her to have all this, unless they could find the letters that were supposedly here somewhere, from her mother.Thirty years earlier there had been love and tragedy. Lillian had married Freddie five years earlier because she had been pregnant and then she lost the baby. He was writing a novel and promised the minute he wrote, ""The End."" They would get pregnant. It was to take place in Tuscany so she suggested they go there for the summer. She could find a job and he could write. So they did. Her life changed. She loved the winery and the vineyards and the owner. There was a brief affair but she felt so guilty: a bout cheating on Freddie and about loving Anton. She was a strong character who knew what was right and did it. Fred was the one: the weak one, who held on, thinking only of himself, before the accident and after. But they had a beautiful daughter, Kate. One they both loved with their whole hearts. He had been in that chair for over two years. The doctors had said it would only be a couple of years before an infection of some sort took him. They all: Lillian, Fred, Anton, and Kate, lived this lie for over thirty years. Now, both Lillian and Anton were dead. And Kate knew the truth. She also had a great many decisions to make, decisions that would affect her father her sibling, the employees of the vineyard. She was devastated. This book had me at the edge of tears, nose stuffed up for the last half of it. The beginning was hard because I was waiting for bad things to happen. Then they had and I could move on. Gut-wrenching, soul-stealing. What a beautiful book!I was invited to read a free e-ARC of These Tangled Vines by MacClean's ARC team and Netgalley.

This book starts off very well with Fiona surprised to find out she’s named in a will and needs to travel to Italy to find out more. The pacing was quick and Fiona made a great character to watch the family drama unfold as her new found relatives are shocked by her inclusion at all in the will. Unfortunately the perspective then shifts between present day and flashbacks of the past. By their very nature the flashbacks have an inevitably tragic end that hangs over them. Fiona and the reader also find out who the real villain in the story is which I found to be quite appalling. It’s really an anti-love story that’s too tragic. It’s an interesting unveiling but Fiona becomes too full of platitudes about forgiveness that annoyed me as she was so unreal.

Her father was Anton Clark, a man she had fallen in love with years earlier while working at a vineyards in Italy, while Fred was writing the book that would later become a best seller. Lillian asked that she keep the secret because she believed that Fred wouldn’t be able to handle it, so Kate did. Then she got a call early one morning from Italy saying that Anton had passed but as she was named in the will she needed to make it to Tuscany as soon as possible. Kate arrived with so many questions in her head of why had it happened, she definitely didn’t expect some of the others she got. Let alone being named as the heir to the vineyards and estate that was worth over 100 million Euros.  His children, Connor and Solange, were not exactly happy with it, sure they had gotten property and several million in cash each, they had just figured they would get it. After all didn’t he owe it to them for being the cheating tyrant father that they hadn’t spoken to in awhile. Was he really that? Or was he a loving man whose ex wife just painted that way? Were the letters between Anton and Lillian hidden away somewhere proof for Connor that she was blackmailing him?? Or would they show that they were truly a couple in love? That the reason Kate was left the estate because he knew she would run it like he had when he met her mother that fateful summer?  Would the memories made that summer by Lillian and Anton come back to life and show their daughter why she was kept a secret?Now I will admit there are a few paragraphs or pages I skipped here and there just because it seemed to go on a bit too long. But other than that it was a truly a book that you add to your TBR list and enjoy when you have the time because you won’t want to put it down.

I don't sign up for romances very often because they are unrealistic, idealistic fantasies.As this book unfolded its tale of an unexpected inheritance, it simultaneously revealed the mysteries surrounding the beneficiary's existence. A marriage losing its flames, with commitments waning, and the simultaneous appearance of a soul mate from outside the union ignite the withering soul of the beneficiary 's Mom years ago.I appreciate that the author, Julianne MacLean, presents the truth often omitted that there is most often a very high price tag on such a situation. Historically, this has happened repeatedly among those who have engaged in similar circumstances.The story also details livung functionally, among the dysfunctional ; not gettung caught up in it when choosing that path could cost one everything.I love the author 's subtle character development. I can't recal the moment whrn I realized that I felt that I understood the main character. She, the author, does a great job of presenting types of people without creating a charicature of them.

Set primarily in Tuscany, Italy, this emotional story, with the exception of one chapter, is told through through the eyes of three different women (Fiona, Lillian, and Sloane), discovering and explaining their relationship with one mysterious man, Anton, who loved them all, one as a lover, the other two as their father by different women.Because this story is about relationships, the well-crafted dialogues brings the story to life as characters struggle to know who they really are and what they truly want, while desperately seeking happiness that never comes as they expected it.Although described as a romance, this is not a superficial love story but rather a poignant and deeply emotional journey of sibling conflicts, marital challenges, and personal misunderstandings. The basic plot at first seems a little familiar but quickly takes on a less predictable path with an uncertain future. Although a good escape binge read, this novel can be enjoyed nicely in shorter installments without losing continuity.I found myself enjoying the ending more than I anticipated because it seemed realistic and honest. The emphasis on food and wine enjoyment creates a fun backstory without becoming gluttonous.The chapters are labeled with the names of characters telling the story and years, when needed, making it easy to rotate storyline perspectives. The Audible narration supplement worked well with tasteful drama and intonations that enhanced my reading with appropriate character interpretations.This author is one in will definitely consider again.This was my first Julianne MacLean novel, and I was not disappointed. The author creates a compelling storyline filled with interesting and complex people worth knowing and understanding.
