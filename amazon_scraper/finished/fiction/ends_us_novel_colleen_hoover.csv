Amazon Customer,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6J7323SYEWVEOA7N2T3472QRUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2016",0,,https://www.amazon.com/Ends-Us-Novel-Colleen-Hoover/product-reviews/1501110365/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.”I'm going to start this review off with this statement: I didn't cry while I was reading this book, but I did cry several days later when I was looking back on Lily's story. That shows how emotionally charged this story is, along with the true power behind Colleen's writing. I'm not going to give away any spoilers because you need to go into the book blind. If you want to know what happens, there are definitely some reviews out there that tell you the big twists and turns. But take my advice and don't spoil this book for yourself. It will lose a lot if you go in knowing exactly what to expect. So seriously, don't do it to yourself. Just let the beauty of Colleen's writing sweep over you and sink in.“All humans make mistakes. What determines a person's character aren't the mistakes we make. It's how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.”This is honestly not only one of the best reads of 2016, but also one of the most (if not the most) empowering. I want to give this book to every man, woman, and even teenager (it's definitely a NA/adult read) and tell them... READ THIS NOW! Do you want to know why? Because this book carries with it a very strong message, one that shows strength and courage that many people might not have at the time, but after reading will understand and gain. I honestly don't know if there has ever been a time when I was prouder to be reading the heroine's story due to her choices. Ultimately though, Colleen Hoover wrote a book that everyone can take something away from. Colleen always writes such unique stories, and this one is certainly no exception. But the one thing I will say is that this is truly her best book yet.“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”Lily's story is one that I never wanted to stop reading. If I know that I'm going to need to read a book in multiple sittings (which was the case with this book), I usually try to find a good place to stop. One in which, nothing major is happening and nobody is facing some drastic/perilous moment. Well you see the problem with this book is the fact that there is literally NO. GOOD. STOPPING. POINT! None! There was never a part where I felt safe in letting this book sit overnight because I knew that the story and the what if's would play endlessly in my mind. So I stayed up and read it all in one sitting because I simply couldn't stop. Lily was someone that I connected to right from the get go. I knew as soon as the book started that I would like her, and that never once stopped while I was reading. However, I didn't realize how much her character would affect me while I was reading. As I said before, after I was finished reading, I couldn't have been prouder of her decisions. The strength she had throughout the story to go through what she did, but also her resolve and conviction just made me constantly cheer her on. Lily is truly one of the most admirable characters that I have ever had the pleasure of reading about, and that admiration goes extraordinarily deep.“Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.”I mentioned it briefly above, but this book has a very powerful message, and this message is actually carefully woven into the story from page 1. You obviously don't realize it when you start reading the novel, but it's there when you look back after finishing. And this is also why I'm going to reiterate the importance of going into the story blind, because just as unexpected and emotional it is for the reader to read and witness what Lily goes through, it is even more unexpected and emotional for Lily. This is where this book truly shines, because you as a reader feel like part of the story. There's a very slow burn while reading, one in which we get to know characters and see the develop in the ways that we as humans get to know each other...but then Colleen rips that metaphorical rug out from under all of us, and shocks us with one revelation after another. But you know what? That's exactly how life is sometimes...sometimes you never see things coming in a million years and you have to figure out how to deal with these radical changes you never thought would happen.“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”Where this book really got me though was the meaning of the title. Throughout the entire time I was reading, I kept wondering what the title meant. Because come on...this is Colleen Hoover and literally EVERYTHING has some significance (no matter how small). And when I got to the part of the story where the title finally made sense, guys let me tell you...this had an impact on me like no other. I just sat there with my book in my hands staring at the page for a solid 5 minutes. It is the perfect title for the perfect book.“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we'll never get back.”I connected with this book in my own way, and for that I am extraordinarily thankful to Colleen Hoover for even writing this book. The author's note at the end was just as powerful and amazing as the rest of the story, but it shows just how personal this story was for her to write. I applaud Colleen for writing this book and not ""making things easy"" for the main character or glossing over the ""bad parts."" This is an incredibly realistic book that makes you realize many things and leaves an imprint on your soul. It's important to remember that everyone must make extraordinarily difficult decisions in their life, and not everyone will agree with them. If this book even empowers one woman to take steps in making an important decision, the Colleen Hoover did her job. And I count myself lucky to have had the honor of reading this story because I am a changed person because of it!Happy reading :)",Everyone Needs to Read This Now!,Verified Purchase,306 people found this helpful,944,169173,464,Public

Three or four years ago I went through a string of so-so to bad Colleen Hoover books, and I decided to just put her out of my mind. I ignored her new releases, and I lumped her into my mental pile for authors who are ""not for me.""Recently, one of my friends wanted to buddy read this book. I thought, ""Gah, pay full price for a book I'm not going to like?"" However, I sucked it up and sort of grumbled about it, but I decided to give it a go.And this book blew me away.The Colleen Hoover I last read wasn't writing books at this caliber. This was a whole different level.For one, there are none, and I mean NONE, of the tired romance tropes presents in this book. In fact, this book was a little more woman's fiction than romance, if I'm being honest. While I guess it can still be classified, genre-rules-style, as romance, it is more about Lily's life experiences and the lessons that she learns about herself than anything else. There is a romance present, but I don't think it is the main focus of the story. While I'm not typically a women's fiction fan, I think that if this book took any other trajectory, it wouldn't have been as powerful.I typically don't read reviews before starting a book. In fact, I didn't even read the blurb for this one, or if I did, I forgot it before starting to read. I liked that. I think going in blind with an open mind and minimal expectations is the way to go. Though the twists and turns aren't 100% unexpected, the author very much succeeded in pulling the rug out from under me on more than one occasion.I'm usually not a fan of books where people say, ""Wow, that made me think. This book is a thinker."" I usually just roll my eyes internally because I assumed that the readers are being played like emotional pawns. I know, I'm judgy. But in this case, yeah, I was thinking a whole hell of a lot. It made me reevaluate how I perceive others and their relationships, and it made me rethink my biases. People are always know-it-alls until they are in the situation themselves, and then it doesn't seem quite as simple.The author made one right decision after another with this story. I think that is the key to its success. The author made a relatable, human character in Lily, and gave each supporting character their positives and negatives. There are no villains here. No easy answers. Colleen Hoover also made an insanely smart decision to have only Lily narrate the story. There was no other choice, really, but it gave readers a laser-focus on her, which is where our focus deserves to be.While this book has a positive ending, it is also a story that can be described as gritty, difficult, hopeful, powerful, and crushing, all at the same time. It is a long story, but it has a fast-pace with plot elements thrown in at the right times to keep interest engaged. I couldn't put the book down from the moment I got into the groove, and I read this story all night until the last page. The dedication is also important to read, but make sure you do it after you've finished the story and not before.Colleen Hoover impressed me so much with this story. It made me rethink a lot of things, but most of all, it made me rethink how I judged Colleen Hoover years ago. I won't dismiss her so easily again.",NOT a Colleen Hoover fan-girl but this was GORGEOUS! **Spoiler-free**,Verified Purchase,142 people found this helpful,2980,12658,986,Public

I have been staring at this computer screen for a good hour now trying to find the right words. And that is after I spent a good 6 hours in my couch reading it. This is not the kind of book that can easily be put down to be read later, there are no good spots to stop. Once you start it becomes incredibly difficult to take a break.The story is complex. It is raw. It is honest. It is sad. It is painful.It shows the reality of human nature. The reality that we are not black and white, simply good or bad. The vast majority of us fall somewhere in the middle- people that make mistakes.It Ends with Us is told through Lilly's eyes. It is told in the present tense but we also get glimpses into her past as she reads journal entries from when she was a teen.Lilly is brave and strong. But also as vulnerable as any other woman out there. I was rather impressed with her character, with her sense of self and her ability to prioritize. She had many hard choices to make and she made them well. They were hard, very hard... and there will be a small part of you, as there was a small part of her, who will wish different, but you will know that she did the right thing in the end.Riley is amazing! I absolutely loved him. And he is the perfect example of how things are not always as they seem. But most importantly, of how often there is so much more to someone's story than we know. Everyone has a past and everyone is -for better or worse- defined by that past. I believe with all my heart that Colleen Hoover chose the right ending for both Lilly and Riley, but I do not believe someone like Riley should be treated with hatred. I felt his pain, specially in the end.Atlas was pure perfection. There are so many kids out there in the world like him. How wonderful would it be if there were more Lillys?!All in all this was a fantastic read. Super emotional. Heart wrenching.When the book was over though something did not feel right. The last 3-4 pages felt rushed. Lilly 'jumped ship' too fast.And all that being said, I feel I should mention something I did not see mentioned anywhere and I was certainly not told myself: if you have been in a abusive situation (parents/partners/other) and still have hard days, don't read unless you are having a good day. I will be honest and say that had I know what the book was about before reading it I would not have read it. I felt in the end of this book similarly to how I felt when I finished reading The Problem with Forever two months ago (another book I started without knowing what it was going to be about)- reliving memories better forgotten. It was far to real, and if you, like me, can relate to the main female character in either of those books, you also know you need to be in the right frame of mind while reading it...",I have been staring at this computer screen for a good hour now trying to find the right words,Verified Purchase,43 people found this helpful,116,211268,163,Public

It gave me an understanding of a situation I found hard to relate to before I read this book.

I also felt that Hoover showed that true freedom came from forgiving and from making hard changes to end generational cycles of violence and codependency.My only Criticism is I ached to know more about the burgeoning second chance relationship between Atlas and Lilly.

Giving a review of this book without spoilers is nearly impossible, but I'll try my best. It's the least I can do because CoHo has just given us her best work to date, and I don't say that lightly.The way Colleen made you feel every single emotion--from empathy to anger, from sadness to happiness, from understanding to confusion--in the span of 373 pages is unparalleled. As someone who has lived the same trials that Lily has, I understood the struggle between loving someone else while needing to love your self worth more.Hoover has obliterated every single pedestal she's placed herself on thus far. She's crushed them with It Ends With Us. She's given us not only a book, but a story. A story so many people have lived in silence. A story that so many don't understand. She gave a voice to the voiceless. She gave those who feel like everything is hopeless... Hope.If I could, I would give this book 100 stars.

I HATE romance novels!"" And it surely seemed like a modern romance novel, replete with a red-haired heroine (Why are the heroines always red-headed or have ""burnished curls""? What about the occasional limp beigy-gray tendrils? Oh, OK ... I digress ...) who is gorgeous and spunky and smart and determined; a serious chiseled-jaw male with a perfect physique and a successful career (a neurosurgeon!); an unbelievably supportive (and rich) best friend; the requisite gay male friend who can be called upon for last minute dates ... i.e. the usual cast of characters. Then, of course, the ""meet cute"", which happens several times to build tension; the unadulterated lust of the guy (who actually falls to his knees to beg for sex at one point); the obvious attraction, but cautiousness of the gal; the holy-crap-big seduction scene. All so predictable, all so typical, contrived Romance Novel. (Is it only me or does everyone kinda wish the heroine would fall in a vat of acid to shake things up?) The writing is typical of that genre, also, with its amazing coincidences and excessive hyperbole: she cries harder than she has ever cried before, then a few pages later, she cries harder than ever once again; they are the best cookies she has ever tasted, this is the best restaurant she has ever eaten in; she is sadder than she ever been in her life. Etc. Every other page has a new benchmark, by gosh. I almost gave up on the book at least three times in the first 40% of it, but well, I was comfy, two cats were asleep on my lap, I was sipping wine, soft music, things could be worse. I persevered. But then things started changing subtly, then less subtly. I stopped gagging and paid more attention. The characters were still beautiful, each of several relationships still had its own cutesy, private vocabulary and references, all the good guys were still giving to charity, but suddenly we weren't in Kansas anymore. I don't want to go further because I am really glad that I didn't know how the plot was going to turn. There are a lot of reviews here that can give you that information if you want it.

Typically I write book reviews shortly after finishing books since they are fresh in my mind but this one required some processing before I could find the appropriate words. First, let me backtrack and state that this is my first novel by Colleen Hoover and I loved it so much that I've already bought a couple of her other books! I had just started reading a different book when I saw this book advertised on social media and thought I'd see what it was about. I immediately purchased It Ends with Us and stopped reading my other novel, which is something I very rarely do. Though there isn't a book description listed on the product page, I was intrigued because of the high percentage of 5 star reviews and most of the reviews I read were very enigmatic.  After having read the book, I can see why many reviewers chose to review It Ends with Us in that way.""Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the waves had once been there, long after the tide recedes.""Normally in a book review, I will introduce the protagonists and give my own summary without giving spoilers, however I feel this review needs to be different because, as other reviewers have stated, I feel it's best to go into reading this book blind, or at least mostly blind. There are three main characters, one female and two males but it is not a love triangle. Besides these three, there are also some friends and family members who play important parts in the development of the story. Without them, the story would not turn out the way it does. All of these characters have admirable qualities as well as faults and that's what makes them human. Throughout the novel, we see especially the main female protagonist grow and learn from her life experiences.""Just because we didn't end up on the same wave, doesn't mean we aren't still a part of the same ocean.""It's hard to decide which genre this book fits into because there are elements of many genres within this novel. There is romance but not so much that it takes away from the storyline. There is also some humor, not in a I-laughed-so-much-my-abs-hurt-and-I-can't-breathe way. For me, I snickered every now and then. I find it safe to say this novel fits in the contemporary fiction genre the best, in my opinion.I feel a good amount of the novel is light and fun but there is also some sadness and complicated situations. When I hit the 60% mark in this book, I spent the rest of the time with my hand either covering my mouth or over my chest. I also bit off most of my nails because I was so anxious to read what would happen next. As I finished the novel, I had some tears because it was so moving and beautiful. I definitely recommend reading the Author's Note at the end which explains how the author found her inspiration for this novel. I cried while reading that too.In summary, I'm so happy I decided to read It Ends with Us because I loved it! This was my first Colleen Hoover novel and I'm already planning on reading some of her other novels. I just can't believe it took me this long to discover her but now that I have, I will look forward to her new releases. Whether you've read books by Colleen Hoover or not, I highly recommend reading this novel.

She pulls her readers into the story in just the right way that allows them to feel as though they too are living the events of the story, which is something not many authors do well.

I am even toying with the idea of forcing the hubby to read it (he is not a reader by all means - HA). However, he did mention he wanted to give reading a try again and what better story than It Ends With Us. This book truly is for everyone.Personally, I think this is Colleen’s best work yet. I don’t want to go into the story any further. This book is best to go in blind. I even encourage you to not read the blurb if you haven’t already done so. Just trust me on this one. This story is truly something else. The first chapter hooked me, the second chapter starts chipping away at my heart and by the third chapter I found myself grinning and laughing like an idiot. Every page after that took my breath away through a range of emotions evoked within me. I even experienced a shock of a lifetime because never in my book world have I been blindsided the way I was with It Ends With Us. After reading the author’s note at the end, I realized that is exactly how the heroine felt herself. On that note, I have to say… I cried harder reading the author’s note than the book in its entirety. You will understand why when you get there.Everything in this book is just pinned down with the factor of WOW!

There is a really strong message in this book that I hope everyone can take from it no matter what position in the situation they find themselves in. I am still thinking about it all and find myself questioning everything. This story brings in a whole new perspective of everything I strongly believe I would or would not take action to in a specific way in a given situation, but in reality if it was my life would I still be as adamant and sure of what I always thought I knew or believed in? GAHHHH!!!Lastly, the title in itself IT ENDS WITH US… the moment it hit me of what the title truly means knocked the breath right out of me.

I kept reading reviews from those with early copies. They were all calling it Colleen’s best work, her most personal story. Review after review, I pined for the book more and more. August could not come fast enough. Luckily for me I was able to score an ARC. However I still picked up the paperback. Have you seen the cover? It’s beautiful.It Ends With Us is a heavy and personal story about Lily Bloom that includes real life events and inspiration from the author’s life. If you are used to crying and having your heart broken while reading one of Colleen’s books, this is no different. It’s a powerful story that shows an uncommon perspective on a situation people often judge harshly. I’m being vague, I know. I’m trying really hard to say very little. I believe in order to get the full effect it’s best to go in blind. Check your expectations and biases at the door. Just listen (read) and take in the complicated and heart wrenching story that is It Ends With us.This book was a page turner for me, one I’m unlikely to forget anytime soon. The naked truth is that parents are having Colleen sign copies of this book to give to their children when they grow up. It’s that important. I somehow managed to keep it together while reading the book, but completely fell apart after reading the Author note. Don’t make the same mistake I did, be sure to have tissues handy.All that being said, I do believe this book deserves a trigger warning.

This book made me experience extreme emotional highs, where I am so in love and just wrapped in this warm fuzzy hug and I'm soaring and never want to come down. And then we crash and I'm so low and hurt and confused and betrayed and sad and devastated. EMOTIONAL WRINGER! And it hurts so so good.This is a great read and deals with a topic that's important and relevant and it needs to end. Knowing your limits and realizing your self worth and a message that all young women (and young men too because abuse can go both ways) need to hear...we need to pound this into our brains; you are worthy of love, you deserve happiness,you deserve to be treated well.

Colleen Hoover is one of the authors who never disappoints, and personally she is my favorite author and the reason that I set the bar so high for books.All of the characters in this book are so relatable and real, you can see parts of them in yourself and others. This book is going to make you smile, laugh, cry, angry, hurt...basically it's going to make you feel. Personally, the best books for me are the ones that I can literally feel in my heart and this one did just that. Colleen is the best at building a reader up and making you feel so happy, then she completely decimates your heart before she puts it back together again...it's amazing.That being said there are heavy issues in the book and I thankfully have never had to deal with them in my own life. It made me think of how I was taught about self worth and how you treat others and how you are treated. I can remember a time when my cousin was being a jerk to his girlfriend and I looked at him and said, 'You do not talk to people that way, and if you want something do it yourself.'  I heard my dad proudly say to himself, 'That's my daughter.'The best books are the ones who make you think and question what you think or know.  They give you perspectives and insight. They challenge you to make tough choices. They stay with you long after you have read them and make you feel, it's a cliche for a reason, all the feels. This book does all that and so much more.

She was just much stronger than me. Although I'm no longer in that situation, it took me a lot longer to come to that decision than it did it Lily. I'm so proud of Lily, and I'm so proud of all the other women who have found the strength and courage to leave a situation like that. To better their own lives,  to protect their children, to give their children better lives, and to understand that your life is worth so much more than that, that you deserve so much better. People really don't understand how hard it is to leave a situation like that, and I love that this portrays the real struggle, the real pain.Colleen, I've read over and over how hard this book was for you to finish. But I'm so glad you did.

A few weeks ago, I saw a post that was talking about this upcoming release, and though I can't remember whose account it was, I do remember what she said about It Ends With Us.This story is important.And after devouring and absorbing the story this morning, I full-heartedly agree. It's a story about love. It's a story about relationships. And most importantly it's a story about women who suffer from domestic abuse.The book begins with Lily meeting Ryle, a successful neurosurgeon, and the romance that sparks between them. Ryle is against long term relationships, but Lily finds herself falling for him anyway. Everything is perfect... for a while.It starts as nothing really. An accidental push, a hot temper. A few stitches and an apology later, all is forgiven. Lily is confident that this is nothing like how her dad treated her mother. Ryle is not her father. Ryle is sorry. This is different.When Atlas, the first boy she ever loved comes back into her life, Lily finds herself trying to defend Ryle, trying to justify his actions. But Atlas seems to know the situation even better than Lily herself. The story follow Lily as she eventually realizes her situation for what it is until she is able to admit it to herself, and can finally pick up the pieces.Lily's story is important. I won't pretend that I know a lot about domestic abuse, because I don't. However, I do know that exists, and now because of this book, I know that not every case of domestic violence is the same. Not every woman hates her abuser, in fact she may still love him so much that she sacrifices her own safety and mental health. This story makes the powerful statement that the cycle needs to stop somewhere, that violence is never okay, that sometimes love means letting go and leaving the situation. The vicious cycle of domestic violence? It ends with us.Note: This book does contain sexual content, though not a lot, as well as f-words and other language. Though I think the book would have been better without this content, especially the language, I believe the message of the story itself is more important and is worth the read.",An Important Story,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,22,11558438,14,Public

This is not a typical book; this is a journey through life. Ms. Hoover makes the reader feel every emotion from the viewpoint of a fifteen-year-old to a twenty-five-year-old. She also makes the reader think. What would I do if I were in that situation? Would I be so quick to judge? Would I be willing to help?It’s hard to say anything more without giving away the story.

She never fully understands why her mother never leaves him, and why she makes excuses for him, but she knows that she will never let a man treat her as her father treated her mother. Lily has a kind soul and when she notices a boy who seemed to be homeless she befriends him. Atlas has a story of his own, but the one person he will always love will be Lily for her kind heart. Life moves on, and they lose contact but both land up in Boston. Lily meets a man, a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, who seems perfect in every way, until he is not. The love story between Lily and Ryle will break you. You see the signs, you start making excuses for him, praying that it was an accident, but even you know it was not. Lily finds herself looking at her mother’s mirror. When she bumps into Atlas it opens a door that she is not sure if she wants to walk through. But Atlas knows Lilly better than anyone, and he knows when to step back. Will Lily become her mother, or will she be strong enough to walk away from a man that truly loves her. Will Atlas keep his promise? Ms. Hoover has written a story that was soul-destroying, but so skilfully written. I don’t know how she did it, that I fell in love with all the characters, that I found myself hoping for a miracle but deep down I knew it was never going to be.

They were falling because I was sad to see someone loose something that they truly loved with all their heart. They were falling because I was so happy that someone was standing up for someone who needed more protection than the other. They were falling with the hope that they would all be able to achieve their happily ever after.Would I like to see a follow up to this??

But I must say that upon completion, and after getting past the obligatory character BFF sequences (does anyone say BFF anymore?) and the hot sex episodes that just seemed to naturally occur (why didn’t these hookups ‘naturally’ occur back in my day??), this was a rather well written and deep experience that ultimately stayed with me for a surprisingly long time.Colleen Hoover revealed at the end of this novel that she’d undertaken a more personal and profound effort than she’d ever undertaken before and it certainly shows. “It Ends with Us” is a multi-layered love story with deep roots in important topical and social issues which Hoover brilliantly weaves into a compelling storyline. Again, once I got past the requisite pop culture aspects of this work, I found much meaningful discourse that held me and kept my rapt attention to the book’s completion.Admittedly I have not read any other works by Colleen Hoover and I suspect that their catalogue fall largely into this “chick” genre (yes I know, I’m being sexist again), but I do recommend this particular work for its importance with respect to woman’s violence issues and the very important stance it takes on women getting out of violent relationships and starting anew. With that, my hat is off to Colleen Hoover for helping to expose these atrocities and for attempting to help women escape these horrible relationships.

As a survivor of abuse, both as a child and an adult the rollercoaster I was taken on was just too much for me. As I knew it would be which is why it took me so long to read this book, ive read every other Hoover novel but this one scared me. Ive lived this life, I didnt want to relive this life but one night as I was all alone unable to sleep it called to me. After 4 hours of tears, pain and ANGER, I wish I could take it all BACK because the ending is so very bittersweet that it left me no closure. It made me fall in love with characters I shouldnt love and made me relive my own emotions during an abusive marriage. In the end I wanted to read a real happy ending and while yes it does have one, sort of, its not complete to me. I feel a bit hopeless, I feel let down, I feel like a book like this must have a better ending. And as Colleen has mentioned she will never write a sequal.

I want to see Ryle redeem himself and I want to see Lily live her happiness. I dont want it, I NEED it.

In Colleen Hoovers notes at the end of the book she does state there are different experiences when it comes to abusive relationships and situations and this book was based on hers. I'd say mine was a bit more severe in the sense that not only did I have to protect my mother, but myself and brother as well, since non of us were safe.SO - I actually thought the introduction and situation with Atlas from the beginning was cute, nice, and I figured he would have some major role to play in the story. But I honestly, in the beginning, completely skimmed the journal entry chapters (then later went back and reread realizing they were actually relevant to the plot), I just wasn't sold on him as a character. We get absolutely NO backstory on him. With that, Lily meeting Ryle and their interactions because all I wanted to read about. At least with Ryle we got more of a backstory, we got his sister becoming Lily's best friend, and we got to see more of his life and personality. I just fell in love with him as Lily did. Also as the story progresses you come to understand and relate to the way he is, with that kind of career it can be hard to dedicate the time and resources to a personal life. Plus you just have to make his a bit cocky and little ego for it to be an exciting romance :)OK - so the first ""accident"" - to me I honestly felt that was way overreacted on all fronts. Given my upbringing I don't think I would have even thought of this as an abusive moment, but again that's me. The 2nd and 3rd times - yes, I don't think Lily overreacted. I'm glad Atlas was there, but again I just wasn't connecting the two together to have any romantic connections. Also I was bit more scared for Lily even running to him knowing he was basically the ONLY cause for Riley's ""moments"".I truly wished they would have sought our some kind of counseling before just jumping to divorce. Again, I'm a product of multiple divorces, and yes I think I had a better relationship with my father later in life, but never want to see young kids experience this. This is a hard one to make a decision on, my mother thought a father with substance abuse (not physically abusive at all) was not a situation to have her daughter in, but then went to the physically abusive stepfather.... You just never know and so I can understand Lily making the decision she did, and the reader can assume closure in the end that Atlas would never be abusive toward her knowing her upbringing... I just don't necessarily think I would have made the same decision in the end and unfortunately for me, I guess I was a bit bummed she and Ryle parted ways.Don't get me wrong, I liked the story and the thoughts and perspective it made me see.

Maybe I should just say how pretty this cover is and end there because I’m not sure I can talk about this. I’m seriously at a loss and so consumed by my feelings for this book. It was emotional, thought provoking, and beautiful! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I can't get over the emotions Colleen Hoover stirred inside me... sadness, anger, joy, love. This is what a book should be. It’s extremely powerful and a story that I think everyone should read. I've only read one other CoHo book so I'm not sure if it is her best book, but I'm going to say yes. Now, I want to share a full review with you, but like many others, I’m not sure how I can talk about this book without spoiling it for you. It really is something you just need to pick up and read. Go into it knowing as little as possible and just immerse yourself it all the feels!It Ends With Us is about a girl named Lily. She’s had a troubling childhood, but that’s not to say that there weren’t some good moments. As it goes though, it ends too quickly and she finds herself in her twenties, moving to Boston, and dreams of starting her own business. Needing a quite space Lily hunts for a quite rooftop and ends up meeting a guy named Ryle. Instantly there’s a connection. As introductions are made she finds out that he’s a neurosurgeon who’s dedicated to his job and at becoming the best in his field. She too reveals things about herself that she would never normally confess to a complete stranger, but they begin to develop an honest line of communication with these “naked truths.” This pulls them closer together and Lily knows that this could be a whirlwind romance and she’s not ready for it so they agree to take things slow. But as her and Ryle get to know each other better Lily can’t help but think back to her first love, Atlas. Homeless, Atlas stumbled into the abandoned house behind hers and this is where things got intense and deep really quick. We see pieces of him appear daily and it seems that he’s left breadcrumbs trailed throughout her life. So when he reappears it threatens what Lily and Ryle have built.This is all I’m going to say about the plot. Like I said, I don’t want to spoil anything for you, but what I can do is talk about how amazing and real these characters are. First up, Lily. I loved that we were able to flip between her past written as journal entries to Ellen (yes that Ellen) and her present. It was so well done because something with this type of flashback and be distracting or confusing, but this was quite the opposite. It was enjoyable and revealed more of Lily’s character each time. She’s such a strong character and I was so proud of her when she took the leap of faith and started her own business especially because it was something that she had been dreaming of. One key to her success was a girl named Allysa. An incredible friendship formed between these two. It was easily to see why with Allysa because she’s funny, goofy, a huge supporter, and honest. My favorite line from her mouth was that she is a “Pinterest whore.” It killed me. What girl in her teen-mid twenties isn’t?! Ryle was quite the rollercoaster for me. At first I swooned and adored him, then something changed. He became a character I detested and it was crazy to watch the 180 degree flip, but I also felt bad about it. You’ll see why, but Atlas. Sweet sweet Atlas. He’s got to be one of my favorite male characters ever! Like I said, he was sweet, thoughtful, kind, and filled with so much love. The relationship between him and Lily developed slowly and quite innocently and as it progressed it turned into something so deep that it was overpowering and charged.Now there were moments when I found things to be a little too predictable, but like a good CoHo book there was a shocking twist ahead. I didn’t see it coming. It punched me in the gut. I wanted to be wrong. I cried. It made me angry that this whole situation happened. I found myself questioning morals and IT. WAS. HARD. What was amazing though was that CoHo was able to weave moments of love, laughter, and swoon worthy moments into all of the heaviness. Just when your heart can’t take any more the ending hits you. It leaves you stunned and wanting more, but the ending is perfect. And the authors note at the end punched me in the gut. Don’t skip ahead. This MUST be saved for last. You can yell at me later.",A powerful and eye opening read that's a MUST for anyone.,Verified Purchase,11 people found this helpful,296,2698779,275,Public

So here it goes… one of the most earth shattering books Colleen Hoover has ever written, I couldn't put it down; I know that every single book that Colleen writes makes a difference in me, there’s always something back in my mind that changes thanks to her books, they make me different and I’d like to believe they make me a better person.Lily has worked hard to get out of that town that has so many bad memories she wants to forget, she wants a different start, a better one and the chance to be the woman she always dreamed to be, when life puts Ryle on her path she doubted to even be around him, but Ryle made it easy for her, they fell hard and fast and when she least expected it, someone from her past came to make her thinks twice about the choices she has made in life.Ryle has an aversion to relationships but something inside him is telling to change that rule for Lily, he successful and he knows what he wants in life but after one look at Lily, everything that he was supposed to put first, just changed. But there’s something that he’s hiding from Lily, and it’s something that Lily might not let go that easily but what happens when you meet the one person that makes you reprogram everything you’ve thought was priority?Atlas was the first love of Lily, their story is not quite common but they were innocent, a pure love based on honesty, they knew that they were going to part ways but they decided even at a young age that they needed each other in order to survive their present, even if their future was uncertain.I have to come clean… I'm not proud but not many times I take time to read the notes from authors, but after reading this book, I needed to understand what was behind this story, and well let me tell you that if I was out of tears by end of this book, well THAT note, just made me cry even further.

Once I read the afterward it made me reevaluate some of my critiques. The portrayal of Lily and Ryle's relationship illustrates some of the complexities involved in an abusive relationship, many times it isn't all bad all the time and that's one of the reasons she stays. When Lily has her inner monologue grappling with being in love with a whole person and thus contemplating forgiveness and feeling compelled to HELP and to work through the issue that really resonates. And the scene with she and her mother is incredibly real and poignant, I've never heard it expressed quite so eloquently, that if a man truly loves you he will want you safe from all harm and if he is the source of your harm and anguish he will leave you.... I don't really believe in a ""noble"" abuser although there may be very rare exceptions. I have encountered soldiers with such severe ptsd and night terrors they have attacked their partners and have elected to separate so they will not endanger their loved ones, but this scenario is profoundly different from an abusive relationship specifically the one portrayed in this book. When I read the afterward and the author explained her own connection to the story I did feel a bit conflicted in challenging her unrealistic narrative because it is based in her reality and past experience. However, with Ryle the rationale or origins of his abusive tendencies are explained by childhood trauma for which he has been in therapy for years. He is a highly functioning accomplished professional who maintains good relationships with his family. His relationship with Lily is obsessive and possessive these emotions are the fuel for his rage/abuse. Obsession does not self-extinguish and I find it very hard to believe that Ryle would just step aside and respect Lily's boundaries. While the author may have experienced a peaceful separation between her parents where they essentially agreed to part ways as amicably as possible this just doesn't happen for 99.9% of women. If Lily's story were real she would've likely experienced months and years of stalking type behavior culminating in her murder or severe injury.... Perhaps I am being too harsh but the pattern of abuse in this story doesn't resolve in this fashion without aggressive intervention. I know the author relied on her own family experiences as the basis of this story but she really should have done more research into domestic violence.",Possible spoilers....,Verified Purchase,,165,22182,108,Public

I just really wanted more of her and Atlas I guess maybe to soothe the heartbreak that was her and Ryle. It was a beautifully written story though and I think the reasons she wrote it were admirable. I felt like that about Heart Bones too just wanted a bit more after they found each other again.

Before reading this book, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I thought this story would be straight forward in terms of figuring out the plot line, but I was mistaken.From the beginning of the book, I was fascinated with Lily’s character and the interactions she shares with Ryle and Atlas. As the story progressed, there were moments that left me in shock and I genuinely felt a lot for Lily and what she went through. The way Colleen wrote this story gave a unique perspective into what Lily went through, and what many women have experienced like her. As I got more into reading the story, I found myself holding back tears because, my heart broke for both Lily and Atlas.As I’m writing this, I’m still holding back tears because I’m sad I’ve finished this story and I’m feeling a lot of emotions ranging from being happy to how Lily’s story ended and sadness from the hardships both she & Atlas have endured.If you haven’t read any of Colleen’s books, I would recommend reading this, it’s definitely a book worth your time, and by the end of it, you’ll be looking for a box of tissues around the house.","Tears of sadness, happiness, and a story with an eye opening perspective",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,18,1945415,8,Public

This book was different and I had read it based on a recommendation and did not bother reading reviews first.Abusive relationships happen at all ages, so in my opinion, this book is good for all ages, from teenagers to adults.Lily Bloom understood what a bad relationship was by watching her parents.  (Some people grow up in loving homes and do not always understand what a bad relationship is).  Lily had empathy for her friend Atlas, who was going through some rough times and they developed a 'good' relationship.  Years go by and Lily does well for herself and she meets Ryle Kincaid.  Although he is a neurosurgeon and successful, he has flaws, which you will understand as you read the book.  However, it turns into a 'bad' relationship.  (I don't want to give the storyline away, but I would just say that many people in abusive relationships have a hard time walking away.  Lily took a different stance eventually and I just think this is good for people to read, to learn that it is OK to take a stance and stand up for yourselves, even though I'm sure it is easier said than done.

I had no idea how popular her work was or how seasoned of a writer she was, in fact, I had never even heard of her before, but I took a chance and I was instantly attracted to her characters and her “easy reading” writing style. It’s not hard to escape reality and completely lose yourself in the lives of her characters and their situations. Since then, I have also read “Ugly Love” and now “It Ends with Us.”As a fairly new reader of Colleen Hoover novels, I have to say that “It Ends with Us” is my favorite thus far.Less sex, more story!I’m no prude, but one of the reasons that I didn’t really care for “Ugly Love” was because it was more like a late night soft porn on HBO and lacked what I crave in a book, which is a great plot line.Don't get me wrong, there are tons of sexy time scenes, but I found myself more drawn to the story this time and grew an attachment to the actual characters and not just their sexual members. ;) I had to roll my eyes through most of the super cliche` parts that most women swoon over, but the plot line in IEWU is full of amazing characters and so many layers that it is impossible to put this book down! I really loved the story told through Lily's childhood journals about her relationship with Atlas.There is a lot of humor on the sidelines, but the overall vibe of this book is solemn, heartbreaking, and hopeful.IEWU deals with subjects such as homelessness and first love, but the main focus of the novel is domestic violence. Colleen Hoover executes this theme well and shows her readers first-hand what women and children that endue domestic violence may experience physically and emotionally. Colleen's characters have to face love, life, and loss and embrace every situation that is hurtled at their hearts.There isn't much else I can say here without spoiling the plot, because I have discovered that her novels are best if you know very little about them. I will just say that Colleen has really stepped up and wrote a powerful and gripping novel that everyone can learn from.OK.!SPOILER ALERT! This is the part where I moan and groan about the story aspects that I question.Is rape EVER forgivable?I was very annoyed that Lily seemed to forgive Ryle for the marital rape incident and never reported it when she went to the hospital. She was more concerned about Ryle's reputation rather than her own safety and well-being. WTF! Yeah, she got away from him and left at this point in the story, but still...Would you ever leave your child alone with someone who is known to be abusive?At the end of the book Colleen explains where the inspiration for IEWU came from. To my surprise, it came from her childhood experience with domestic violence. She explained how her father would have violent outbursts directed at her mother, but never at her and her sister. I understand that each situation is different, but in Lily and Ryle's situation, It seemed like his anger was purely temper and anyone in his way could be a victim. I didn't feel like it was okay to leave her new born child alone with him for long periods of time. I mean, she didn't even really feel comfortable being alone with him. Why would you trust him with your child? When Lily and Ryle married, they barely knew each other, and by the end of the book I felt like they STILL didn't know each other... How does she know that Ryle isn't going to be violent with their child?UGHHHHH.",Colleen's Best Yet!,Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,213,298762,45,Public

He’s sexy and bold, a little dangerous and consuming. We are knee deep in that love for him when he strikes Lily for the first time and it’s incredibly jarring. I have a minor in women’s studies, I have worked with battered women, I directed the Vagina Monologues for years in college and when this happened to Lily that first time in her small kitchen, I asked myself “was it an accident? Yeah I think he was running the water over his hands and accidentally elbowed her” oh wait but then he yelled at her. Then he told her it wasn’t funny. I’m saying to myself “he’s upset she’s laughing, but didn’t mean to push her.”Here’s why this story was so powerful to me: abusers don’t come labeled. They are not all bad with no sweetness. And often, the lovable traits are real. Even moreso, their ability to love is real. The tricky part is in that dizziness that is powerful love, there are sharp edges and rough hands and bruises that never completely fade away because they stay deep within.So as the reader, we make excuses with Lily. Then maybe some of us turn a corner and turn on Ryle and are angered that Lily hasn’t done the same. But this is how it happens for many women. This isn’t the story of all abusive relationships. This isn’t a handbook for what you should do when the love of your life strikes you. This is a story, a plausible story, and there are many women out there who will identify with it. And there are many other women who can learn from it. Abusive relationships are not black and white.Heartbreaking and potent.

Justification, excuses, love, pain, you write them in a way that makes it impossible to not feel each emotion deep down in my bones and my soul along with Lily and every person involved.

There is no black and white characterization - it's much deeper and more complex than that, and therefore, far more emotional.”-Emily May ß--------- YES, that is exactly the words I want to express.

MANY . TEARSOnce again, this is a book that I am late to. I have heard so many good things about Colleen Hoover over my book reading journey, and I just recently have been getting into her books. The first book I read by her was “Verity” and while that book is very different than this one,the writing is both phenomenal and emotional. I definitely need to get it together and read all her books. Overall, I rated this book 4.5 stars but I have rounded it up to 5 stars for review purposes.Overall, this book was amazing. It started out as a love story and then switched to some sexy scenes, but halfway through the book is when it became intense. Seriously, I am positive my heart rate steadily rose for the entire second half of the book. With this intensity came heartbreaking revelations and decisions that left me ugly crying at the end. When reading these parts I was so conflicted in regards to the main characters decisions and emotions. The book touches on many serious aspects of romantic relationships, abuse, and love which are all very hard hitting.I felt that all the characters were well represented, complicated, and contributed to the story so much. I was in love with the main character, Lily, and her drive to achieve all she wanted in her life and in her romantic relationships. I also think that she grows throughout the book and this change is represented in her personal thoughts as well as her actions and decisions.The end of the book was such a tear jerker for me, and I can tell that Colleen truly put her whole heart into this book. This is one that I am going to think about for some time, and will recommend it to anyone who asks me for book suggestions.“Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn’t waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.” - It Ends With Us",🌷4.5 STARS🌷,Verified Purchase,,302,19449,117,Public

I felt like that took away from Lily's persona as the strong independent woman who puts her kids first. I also think that because she immediately vegan a relationship with the ""other"" guy after leaving her husband, she made herself appear more culpable for the problems than she would have otherwise.

Let's just say the main male character, Ryle, is quite blunt, and straightforward and I wasn't sure where exactly this book was going to end up because of that.

It was so much more than that.This story is important, for reasons that I think will become very clear once you read this book. I've seen and read all sorts of stories of how this has impacted other readers, and I'm so glad.

Most romantic novels lead to find things about the leading lady that are irritating, and at times ruin the rest of the book for me. Not the case here.

My brother and sister had seen a lot more and a lot worse than I ever did (at least as far as I can remember). My dad wasn't so much physically abusive as he was verbally, but I remember times when he would get up so close to my moms face screaming in it that he may as well have hit her. My brother is 6 years older than me and my sister 10 years older. My parents had been married 23 years before my mom mustered up enough money and courage to leave my dad and her kids behind. My brother has struggled with anger as long as I've been alive. I've seen the terror in my mom's eyes when my brother pulled her around our living room by her hair when he was just a teenager. Broken drywall and interior doors that had my brothers fist or head plunged through. Trying to help him cover up a hole in our living room before my dad got home so he wouldn't be kicked out again. Things a young girl shouldn't be subjected to. When I was 12 I dated a boy that was not good to me. He forced me into sex, belittled and bullied me. It was nice to have the attention from someone, especially a boy. He was a couple of years older than I was, there were times he'd hit me and even put his hands around my throat. But I was just happy to get the attention, even though it was negative. I didn't tell anyone about it until I was in my twenties. I was ashamed, I felt stupid for acting like my mom, I was incredibly embarrassed for allowing someone to treat me like that. I met my husband the following year, he's sweet and would never hurt me. We've been together for nearly 19 years and married for 11.

Oh my god.I bought and read this book right when it came out. Yes. It has taken me a year to review it. What can I say? I'm bad at processing overwhelming feelings. Colleen Hoover shattered my heart and healed it and shattered it again with her gorgeous writing and storytelling.In truth, it's taken a year to digest it and want to read it again. Because this book killed me. I fell in love with the main character, Lily. And Ryle. And Atlas? Don't get me started... I read it and it hurt, and it made me think about things that I didn't want to think about but definitely needed to, and it made me feel things that I didn't really want to feel. The world isn't black and white. That much is clear. Somehow, Colleen found a way to turn words on a page into lovely, flawed, real humans unlike anyone has achieved before. It makes for a beautiful read.As an avid fan of CoHo, and having read all her work, I can tell you with 100% certainty that THIS is her best thing yet.PS.

My writing teachers always stressed “show, don’t tell” and I feel Colleen Hoover’s approach is opposite and it makes the writing so choppy and falls flat. Her books would be so much more impactful if she would step away from telling us every last detail of the characters physical movements and repeatedly naming the emotion the character is experiencing.

In this story the 'message' is wrapped up with other life drama; intertwining love stories, relationships, life and business successes -  and a good degree of warmth. There's some clever, quirky aspects to the book; I enjoyed the 'naked truths' as a communication tool between Lily and Ryle and I thought Lily's younger self, which is an important backdrop to the present day story, was successfully and cleverly told via a journal penned to talk-show host Ellen De Generes. I'm a bit doubtful as to the authenticity of the love between Lily and Ryle - it seemed more like never-ending lust to me, with minimal substance to their emotional connection. For me, that was a bit of a let-down as was the fluffy character of Alyssa and her uber-rich, uninteresting husband, Marshall.Perhaps my main question mark and the reason I did not rate this book more highly is that it is all a bit of a 'soap-opera' ... homeless boy (who creeps into teenage girl's bedroom at night) turns his life around, teenage girl ends up living in same city as previously homeless boy and then, in a city of squillions bumps into him ... and, so on.A more measured and considered dose of reality would have had me rating this book more highly.",A good read.,Verified Purchase,,203,1699366,94,Public

(hence the magician status) colleen is a gifted writer and if you haven't picked up any of her books yet - you should. and then you should be prepared to just order them all because you won't want to stop reading her books. but then you'll be sad when you realize you've read all of her books but don't worry. you can read them all again, or she may just have another one coming out soon - you never know.but seriously - this book.it ends with us was one powerful book. girl meets boy, boy is a grade A dream boy. you will fall in love with ryle right along with lily. you will root for this love story. lily and ryle will make your heart ache.so then the flashbacks to lily's not so easy teenage years start and you find yourself enamored with that story line as well. atlas is the boy we all wanted to fix when we were 16. that one that could steal your breath away but that had that tortured soul that just need to be taken care of and loved and protected.then the fairytale shatters and as a reader i was left with very conflicting feelings. i had fallen in love with these characters and their stories and it broke my heart when the violence started. now, to be clear, as far as portraying abuse in a book goes, colleen was absolutely masterful in her presentation of enough details to convey what was happening without resorting to gratuitous, over-the-top, shock value violence.this book broke my heart, made my stomach hurt, and made me cry a bit. but lily is not written as a victim as much as she is written as a survivor. lily is brave and smart and chooses to take a different path with her life than the path her life went down when she was a child.colleen has written a very honest, realistic book and i'm actually ready for a re-read as soon as i get my copy back! it ends with us is uncomfortable, poignant, and believable.another 5/5 from this girl. seriously. read this book.",heartbreaking and hopeful.,Verified Purchase,,56,4485711,39,Public

They sink down into your soul and like magic you watch her world come alive in your mind and in the world around you. This book touched home for me and maybe that is why I'm speechless.

I got the book purely  because the author was Colleen freaking Hoover - and if you ever read one of her books, you won't ask her readers and followers why.But I will start my day doing some good and give you a bit of a spoiler: YOU WILL CRY!Naked truth? About a few chapters in, I stopped a bit for a break. It was a delicate situation I was reading - and I wanted to read a spoiler just to put my mind at ease. But guess what - I did not see any spoilers! I must have been searching or browsing at the wrong places, because I searched for about ten to fifteen minutes and couldn't find anything. So yeah, at that point I knew I was going to do it on my own.It Ends With Us. I was wondering what it could mean. A lot of plots can come from those four words. And it kept me wondering until the very last chapter. After that, it was like a 'eureka' moment. I did not expect that. Not at all. So if you have preconceived notions on what happens in this book - throw it away. It's better to just go in blind.I was going through the reviews and I found somethings unsettling. It surprises me that people put low ratings on the books that matter. Some will say that they read this book because of all the hype we generated and after reading it - they didn't understand it at all.The situations and characters here are realistic. If you are looking for dragons, faeries, nymphs, aliens, vampires, assassins and the like - you will not find it here. You simply have the wrong genre. (Don't bash, I'm not against those books with those themes at all, in fact I read them too. Just an example.) But if you are open-minded and can grasp what's going on in the world around you - you may like this book. In fact, you may even love it.Look at it this way - some people read fiction books with all the adventures and legendary creatures and they almost believe it. But they read about abuse, charity cases, love and not just fictional love, but 'real situations' kind of love, and anything basically about life and its struggles and they say it's not plausible. Those people are ridiculous.I want to put this out there. Because a book makes you cry does not mean it's already a five star read. I admit - I have encountered a lot of books which made me cry but were mediocre, to say the least. This book is not one of them. This book transcends those and more.Naked truths. I cried for this book because I can read about broken people trying and struggling in life. I cried for the children who are abandoned and homeless. The street children who turn their lives to crime because they had no choice. I cried for the lovers who were torn apart by situations they cannot control. I cried for the ones physically, mentally and emotionally abused. And I cried real hard for those who loves but doesn't deserve love.Honestly, Colleen Hoover's books should come with a warning label. Every book she had, it almost always made me cry. Except for those novellas, this woman knows where to hit you when you least expect it.One of the reasons I love reading Colleen Hoover books is that they are always filled with a powerful message. One you can relate and apply to in real life. There are a lot of lessons here that may guide you in life - you just have to dig really deep and find them.If you have read the book - I urge you to pass it on. The message in there may be 'that message' that someone you know might need at some point in their lives. If not, don't worry.

He's not interested in a serious relationship, ever,  he insists and she's busy starting her own business.Eventually Ryle and Lily meet again, both having never forgotten each other. They fall in madly love and marry.But a young man from Lily's youth, her first love, enters the picture. Atlas was a homeless high school student. Lily helped him survive while at the same time doing her best to prevent her father from being abusive to her mother. Lily's father had been abusive to her mother for years. Atlas was her best friend and she leaned on him to help get her through the heartache of watching the continued abuse of her mother.Years later, Lily and Atlas reconnect as friends and nothing more, as they both have a profound and deep respect for the other. Lily is in love with her husband, she trusts him and respects him. The first time he strikes her, it's deemed a mistake, he didn't mean to and he's sorry. He loves her and does everything he can to make up for his actions. At first, Lily blames herself, just as her mother did.  But is she strong enough to stop it? Or will she endure it, making excuses, just as her mother did. When Ryle sees Lily and Atlas innocently talking it sets into motion a series of events that will shatter their marriage.Domestic abuse is insidious, the abuser often excuses his actions by shifting the blame to his wife, or girlfriend. This enthralling novel explores how the abuser and his victim unwittingly conspire though co-dependency, and how the abuse can dangerously escalate.I highly recommend this exceptionally well written novel.

Yet you actually don't want to know anything else before going into this book because every word was a surprise gift that just kept giving. I loved not knowing everything about the book and characters and being able to guess where the book is headed. I actually don't see this suspenseful element in a lot of books, especially romance novels (they seem to always give away the plot).So going into this book with no idea what the character will do or where the plot is headed, I have to say that I LOVE THIS BOOK! There was literally every element of a romance novel carefully balanced into one amazing novel everyone should read.I loved the characters so, so much! They were strong, passionate, and yet so perfectly-humanly flawed that you can't help but get caught up in their emotions. Each character was distinctly different yet all together they equated to a group of individuals you want to root and cheer for throughout their battles with life. I literally fell in love with all of the characters within the novel and really hope to see more from them!!!I don't want to ruin this book for those who have read it, but I just have to say that I literally never expected anything that happened in this book. There were facets to this book that definitely hit on some sensitive topics and yet these topics become more approachable and yet at the same time a light is shined on ugly truths people often forget. I'm not going to lie, there were parts of this book that were hard to read and even understand yet had me in tears as I too struggled with the decisions characters in the novel had to make.Everything about this book was just pure beauty! Beautiful characters, beautiful words, and an even more beautiful plot that will drag you in and tear you apart in the most amazing way.

She's wondering if her mother will ever speak to her again. Lily was supposed to share all the good things about her dad. But when she got up to speak, she couldn't think of a single thing to say. So she walked back to her seat and sat down. Lily grew up watching her father abuse her mother. She had nothing good to say about him.Lily has a hard time understanding why her mother had stayed in an abusive marriage. But then Lily meets a guy named Ryle who's super good looking. And he's a doctor. And they end up having great sex (which we're made privy to in great detail). And then this Mr. Wonderful loses his temper....While reading the book, I went back and forth between liking Lily a lot, and being totally exasperated with her; between feeling somewhat sympathetic toward Ryle, and hating him. There were times I didn't like where the writer was going, but I was glad it ended in a satisfying way.I do have some complaints with the book. I thought the ""naked truth"" concept was just plain rude. I would not be flattered if, within ten minutes of meeting a man, he said he wanted to ""****"". Also, I didn't find the explicit sex necessary. And I was annoyed with the number of times Lily mentioned how great looking Ryle was.

I love this story even more because of its roots being so personal to the author.Even with all that being said, I did have a couple of issues with the book. For one, as much as I loved Atlas, he kind of felt like a disposable/editable character. He was her out at the end and the catalyst for Ryle's downfall, but other than that, he could have easily been replaced. Also, it felt like Ryle was too perfect and changed his mind about relationships too easily. Still, I do love/respected the way Ryle was written at the end. It was so painful to watch/read how he completely screwed up everything and then had to except it and live his life with the knowledge of what could have been.Now, Colleen....you HAVE to write a sequel to this book!

She had only known him for a few months and when she realised she was pregnant, a wedding was organised. When her parents pulled the car up outside the church, they turned to her and said ‘are you sure, you don’t have to do this, if you don’t want to marry him we can take you home now.’ Fifteen seconds can change everything. It took 13 years of marriage to him and the birth of three children before she had finally had enough. #NakedTruthIt is very easy to have an outsiders perspective on other people’s lives. A lot of us have said things like ‘if that was me I would have done this,’ ‘when I have children they will not be behaving like that,’ ‘if my husband cheated on me he will be out on his arse.’ I believe that you have no idea what you would do in any scenario/situation unless you are actually going through it yourself. An outside prespective is a lot like hindsight.The learnings I took from my parent’s marriage were not obvious to me until I had my first boyfriend – at the age of 13. He was my first love and we were together for 9 months. I had a lot of freedom as a teenager which was not necessarily a good thing. My mother had four part time jobs to make ends meet and was enjoying the company of men for the first time in her life. The lack of supervision for me and my siblings meant that we experienced things a lot earlier than our peers. When my boyfriend started behaving in a way that reminded me of my father I decided to end it. I have no idea how I figured out what my future with him could have been like if we continued to be together. Somehow I must have known.Like Lily in this story I would find it incredibly hard to do a eulogy for my father, in fact I just wouldn’t. I have a relationship with him because he is my father and my children’s grandfather but there will be no tears shed in grief when he passes over one day. Maybe tears for the relationship we could have had. Maybe tears for the moments in my life he has chosen to not be a part of – like my wedding day. #NakedTruthThis was a heart wrenching story. Like Lily I felt torn with indecision on her behalf but I also felt so proud of her. And in the end immense sadness too. The epilogue was bittersweet and was the perfect balm for my burning chest.A fabulous read from Colleen Hoover who never fails to give everything she has to every book she writes.

I would tentatively answer, because I love the fantasy it creates in my head. More often than not, I witness a world that is different from my own. But the most memorable kinds are those that I EXPERIENCE.Within a span of seven hours I became Lily Bloom. I felt every beautiful, every tragic, every nostalgic moment she went through. Colleen Hoover toyed with my emotions. There was even an instance that I was inches away from heaving. Even my body refused to accept the events unfolding in my second life. I waited for a few days from release of this book before I started it, because I wanted to clear my head from any presumptions. And even if I'd say the wait was worth it, I still didn't escape Hoover’s propensity for breaking hearts. As I moved along, I had to stop and ask myself, am I that weak? Is it even remotely right to feel this way? Colleen made me question my beliefs and my own level of resoluteness.Honestly, I'm not even certain if I want to experience it all over again. But there's a pressing need that's pushing me to re-read and dissect the characters. They are multi-faceted and they have very distinct voices and flaws. The twists are just icings on the cake. The real deal are the characters, most especially Lily Bloom. She's a strong, authentic, and compelling protagonist. Ryle will blind you while Atlas will puzzle you. But again ultimately, It Ends With Us is all about Lily Bloom. This is her flight!The irony of it all is that even though my heart was not fully mended after finishing, it still felt like I'm closing a chapter in my life. It is a given that every romance should draw that element of fantasy, but I realized that I will always yearn for the REALITY that comes to fruition as a story unfolds. The TRUTH that pulls me and is more captivating than the butterflies and feels. And largely, the powerful message that augments my understanding of things I don't normally experience. It Ends With Us was thought provoking and honest.

When Lily was a teenager, while all the other kids made fun of Atlas Corrigan, who wore old clothes and smelled funny, Lily decided to become his friend. When she realized he was homeless, Lily made sure he had food, clothes, and even a place to shower. She didn’t do it for accolades but because she couldn’t stand to see someone suffer.It Ends With Us is Hoover’s darkest work yet. It deals with a very difficult subject matter that could be a trigger for some people. With her usual writing skills, Hoover creates a harrowing story of love and heartache that will leave you crying and cheering for Lily. Anyone who loves an excellent work of fiction with unforgettable characters and story should read this book.",Hoover’s Best work to date!,Verified Purchase,,116,3058960,137,Public

So here I was awake and reading all day while my travel companions napped. Then when I went to see Rock of Ages I took a nap... seriously, a book kept me wide awake all day, but a play with loud 80s music put me to sleep! In fairness, I love Rock of Ages but I have seen the show twice. But still...It ends With Us is everything I love about Colleen's writing. There are amazing characters, heartbreakingly amazing characters. Characters that we love even when they are doing dumb things, because they are human like you and I, then she weaves them together in unexpected ways.It Ends With Us is a specific story about the human spirit. It touches each of us because we've all been in Lily's shoes, whether her smart shoes or her not so smart shoes. We've all been the victim or the judge at some point.The balance that Colleen put into these characters is truly amazing. I often love characters that I know I shouldn't love, it's the fun of reading fiction. But Colleen actually brings this to a new level, when through Lily we get the chance to question ourselves and what would we do. And not just once, but throughout the whole story.In the end we get resilient characters, ones that I know will be ok in the long run, once they sort out their shit, because they're not bad people.

We meet Lily when she's 15, living at home, and struggling to deal with her dad's abuse against her mother.  Lily feels powerless to stop it and turns inward to her oh-so-fun journal entries to Ellen DeGeneres.  I absolutely loved these!  It expressed so much of Lily's inner thoughts, both in a humorous and emotional way.  She befriends Atlas, the 18-year old who's squatting in the abandoned house behind hers.  It was endearing to see Lily want to take care of Atlas, and the budding friendship between them.  My only complaint is that I needed more... more time for Lily and Atlas to be together, more deep feelings to emerge.  We fast forward 8 years... Lily starts a new relationship with Ryle.  He was a hard nut to crack for me, especially after I was so Team Atlas.  But Ryle was brutally honest, smart, driven, and I oh-so-loved ""naked truths.""  If only we all did that.  I really wasn't expecting the rift to occur between Lily and Ryle and couldn't figure out how Atlas was going to play a role in Lily's present, although her past always seems to linger.  I adored Allysa, who made such a wonderfully fun and warm supporting character.  Did I love the ending?  Not so much... again I needed more.  But this book constantly pulled at my emotions, and pulled me in so many different directions.  It also had me trying to put myself in Lily's shoes. Was she making the right decisions?  Could I have made those decisions?  That's what makes a great book, in my opinion.","Powerful, beautiful, flawless writing of love and loss",Verified Purchase,,1454,8485,1261,Public

I do this quite a bit, honestly, and it almost always pays off. But with this book especially, I think going in blind is the way to go. If that’s not your reading style, I’ll give you just a bit of background.Lily hasn’t lived the easiest life. After graduating from college she moved to Boston where she opened her own business. Things were finally looking up for her. All of her hard work had paid off. She runs into a local neurosurgeon and immediately feels a connection with him. Ryle, especially wearing his adorable scrubs, is easy on the eyes and such a charmer. He’s also a player and only wants one-night-stands. He refuses to get into a relationship for several reasons, one of them being he just doesn’t have the time outside of being a doctor to be in a real relationship. The sparks start flying and Lily realizes she’s quite interested in Ryle… that is, until a blast from her past, Atlas, reappears, and brings up allllll kinds of confusing feelings.Becca: Yes! I 100% agree with Lisa, if you can go into this one blind then I recommend that you do! It was absolutely incredible to experience each moment and have no idea what was going to happen next!I don’t want to say too much and spoil the story for anyone. I will say that this book does span a large part of Lily’s life. We see her as a teen and also as an adult, it was very well done and I enjoyed the blend of past and present.THE CHARACTERS:Becca: Oh these characters… where do I begin?! I absolutely loved Lily! She had been through so much in her life, yet she persevered and followed her dreams. She was strong and fought for what she believed in. I loved learning about her past and being with her in the present. I felt as though I knew her, I understood and empathized with very thought and every emotion.When Lily met Ryle, I fell for him as instantaneously as she did. He was strong, confident, funny and of course sexy in scrubs ;) Their relationship was a whirlwind that wrapped them up so quickly and I was in it with them! When things got tough for them, I felt every moment as harshly as they did.When Atlas (the blast from Lily’s past) appears it throws this whole story in a different direction. Of course, we meet him with young Lily and then again later in the book. Atlas has this smooth, quiet confidence about him. He comes from absolutely nothing and makes something out of himself. I admired and respected him and I fell for him big time!I know some of you are probably sniffing out a love triangle and freaking out. In my opinion, that is NOT what this is. Some may call it a love triangle on a technical basis, but it really is not and I urge you not to skip this one for that reason because that term is to cliched for what this book actually is.Also the secondary characters in this book, Lily’s parents and Ryle’s sister and her husband are truly imperative in this story. They are just perfect and add so much to the story.I do not think that there is another Author out there who can make me fall in love with characters quite so hard. CoHo develops her characters so well that I feel as though I know them! I had so many feels for these characters that my heart couldn’t handle it! In the past I have loved many CoHo characters (and I still do) but none made me feel what these characters did and none made me feel quite so much that I was a part of their story. Trust me when I say these are characters that you want to meet.Lisa: That’s so, so true, Becca! I agree that CoHo has an amazing ability to make us fall in love with ALL characters, even the not-so-easy-to-love ones.I’m honestly not sure I would categorize this as a love triangle. I know others have, but I disagree. (view spoiler)My favorite characters in this story were, as Becca mentioned, the secondary characters. Specifically Ryle’s sister and her husband, who are wonderful additions to this beautiful story. I also enjoyed the family dynamics and how everyone had each others’ backs when it was most important.TO SUM UP:Lisa: WOW! Just… wow! This has got to be the BEST book Colleen Hoover has written to date. The stark honesty and impacting nature of this story will punch you in the feels. Hard. I’ve never experienced an abuse story to quite this level. I was blown away by this story and left a babbling ball of nerves and tears. A book hasn’t touched me this deeply in quite some time. I also learned quite a bit from this story. We’re always so quick to judge in instances of abuse… but there’s so much more to the story than you see with the naked eye. Don’t judge. Don’t assume facts that aren’t true. And, most importantly, don’t ever think it can’t happen to you or someone you know. Such a strong story that is sure to impact every reader that opens the cover in one way or another. I’m leave completely blown away by this story, as well as hopeful, which is such a wonderful thing. Colleen, you’ve done it AGAIN!Becca: I know some of you may think that I always say this and yes I am a true CoHo fan, but this is by far her best work ever. It Ends With Us is so raw and full of emotions, but most of all it is honest. I cried… A LOT! And I am not talking a few tears or a quiet wimper… I am talking ugly crying that I couldn’t contain. The message it delivers is a powerful one and I know that this is a book that will stay with me forever. Please make sure that once you are done you read the Author note at the end, it will give you an even better view of this book afterward.Colleen Hoover, you slay me with your words. You break my heart and then put the pieces back together. You are an amazing writer and I believe you are a gift for readers like myself.

Colleen rarely takes things in the direction that I am expecting.This book was leaps and bounds beyond what I was expecting. It was emotional and beautiful and I think that everyone should read it; men, women, people who aren’t into romance novels. This book opened my eyes to a different side of the store.

Maybe I have yet to completely process it and when I do I am sure it will be worthy of the 5 stars. Maybe it is because it made me laugh, love, hurt and then it made me angry. So angry I wanted to throttle Colleen for putting Lily through everything. I did not cry but I did feel. It brought back a lot of memories. No, I did not watch my Mom being abused at the hands of my father but yes, my Dad did hit my sister & I. Did he love us, yes. Was he sorry, probably not because that was how he was raised and he thought it was how you taught your children. It ended with me. I made sure to never spank my children, to always walk away when my anger came to the surface and just like Lily I made sure to break the cycle so maybe that is why I feel this was a 5 star book. Maybe it goes even deeper than that. Colleen managed to address a very sensitive subject, showing many different sides of it, and even though she makes you understand why someone would stay she also makes you understand why it is so important to leave. She wrote about how it effects more than just two people, it has long lasting effects on everyone and it changes everything forever.All that being said, I needed more. I needed more interaction with Atlas. What became of him after Lily's birthday. How come they did not keep in touch? I needed more Ryle. I needed to know if he healed, how he was doing, what changed or did anything change? I get that this is Lily's story but I am not sure it was finished yet. Maybe we need an Atlas novella, or a Ryle novella, maybe we need a sequel, I'm not sure but I just don't feel like the story was complete. It was all wrapped up in a tidy little ending but it wasn't finished.Like I said, it has only been three days since I read It Ends With Us so I am still a little unsure how I feel about it. I love Colleen's books. I love how she writes. I love her characters. I loved the characters in this story, all of them. They are normal people. They are your friends, family, loved ones and they have faults. They have fears, they love and are loved. This story was beautifully written but I am still processing and I think that is why this is a 5 star book! Three days later and I am still thinking about it, about the characters, about their journey, about their loves and lives and that is a sign that a story is worthy of 5 stars. When you cannot just get over it, you won't forget, and you feel. Colleen did everything right. She wrote the story that Lily needed written and as a reader it is my right to need more, to want more. The fact that I feel lost shows that everything was just the way it needed to be so yes, this story deserves a 5 star rating and so does Colleen!",A story that needed to be told and needs to be read!!!,Verified Purchase,,145,414225,276,Public

That's the first word that came to mind once I reached the end of this book. Just.....WOW!First off let me just say that this is a strong, emotion filled, gut-wrenching, story with a great ending. Now I understand all the 'trigger' posts. I avoided a lot of the posts because I didn't want any spoilers, I'm glad I did. I completely understand some readers needing to be warned but I for one am happy I didn't know what was coming. Granted it made me want to throw this book out of the 30,000 mile up window I was sitting next to but nevertheless it was a fantastic read and I believe it should be read by everyone.  Thank the Heavens I was sitting on a plane next to my amazing husband when I read the second half and ending of this story because that was the only thing stopping me from bawling my ever loving eyes out. This was a story that needed to be told.The story begins in your typical fashion, girl meets boy, girl likes boy, boy doesn't want a relationship, but they end up in one anyway BUT what is not typical is Lily's backstory read through as journal posts to Ellen DeGeneres. That was a cute touch since I love Ellen. Journal entries about her first love, a boy who was homeless living in an abandoned house next to hers. A boy that never really leaves her mind, ever.Her journal posts would be what you would think a fifteen year old girl would write about mostly, a new crush and such but it also contains deep emotions about her currently lifestyle with her parents. This is where the 'triggers' come in. To spare any spoilers I won't say anything other than there's violence.Later Lily meets a handsome neurosurgeon on a rooftop in Boston. Instant chemistry at it's finest. However, boy doesn't want a relationship so they both go their own way until the fates cause them to cross paths again and finally the boy succumbs to the fact that he can't let the girl go.When they say 'if something seems too good to be true it probably is' it's usually 9 times out of 10 true. Ryle isn't exactly everything Lily would have hoped for even though she wants him to be desperately.Lily finds herself torn in more ways than one. This story really explores a woman's thought process through so many traumatic situations. Lily is strong in some many ways but conflicted in others. She's just like any other woman out there, which may be another reason I adore her.This story has many twists, heart breaking, gut wrenching, twists yet it is still a love story with a great ending that I think every woman in the world should read especially those battling through difficult relationships.Sometimes it's better to walk away than to live with something that isn't right.","If you are on the fence about this book, GO DOWNLOAD NOW!",Verified Purchase,,52,14499729,36,Public

I knew, going into it, that it was hard for her to write, and that something about cow poo happened. That's it. I didn't even read the back of the book.

I feel like I preface every Colleen Hoover review with that simple word yet it’s generally the best way I can describe how I feel immediately following my “CoHoma” (aka the Colleen Hoover induced haze/shock that immediately follows reading one of her books). This was super complex and deeply personal. I cried a lot of ugly tears…mostly toward the latter part of the book, but definitely not surprising because her books always get to me somehow. I don’t know this woman, I’ve never met her, I know her the way most readers do, through her words and let me tell you if you follow anything about her, you’ll know just how kind and generous she seems. Reading this book made me feel as though I knew a deeper part of her and it may sound weird, but I saw some of the best in her through this one book. She manages to make you question everything you ever think you knew by simply making her characters so human. You fall in love with them, you take journeys with them, your heart is sometimes broken by their actions, but in the end you have a better understanding of not only them, but yourself. This is what It Ends With Us does to the reader, it allows you to not only engage in a wonderfully complex journey, but it also makes you do some soul searching.I’ve followed her work since Slammed and have been an avid fan ever since, I go through the same process with every release…asking questions like, “is this my new Colleen favorite?” and then grunting or sighing because I know rating or ranking any of her work is pointless because everything she writes is golden. There has never been a bad Colleen Hoover book and I’m convinced there never will be. Her books are generally very poignant, thought provoking, usually witty and always ; her characters are perfectly flawed, they have depth and their stories generally shock you into a “CoHoma” (this is my new word and I’m sticking to it because her books are spellbinding). It Ends With Us is different in that it pushes limits, makes you question yourself and what decisions you would make if you were any of these characters. This isn’t very different from most of her books because she always shocks me, but her voice and the plot twists combined are completely unparalleled. This was a tough read in so many ways for me because it was so relatable. For many who pick this book up you might have been through something similar or chances are you know someone that has. You may have even judged, commented or witnessed something similar, regardless of the how, I’m betting that you will relate in some way. When you realize how easily black and white can turn to grey it is then that you will understand what it truly means to unravel the mystery that is a Colleen Hoover read. She finds a way to make even the most difficult situations real and creates a challenge for the reader by daring them to confront ugly truths or in this case naked truths.Lily is an incredibly strong character that will both inspire and transform you. I’m afraid to say this was Colleen Hoover’s best work yet, but because of how personal it is I have to applaud her for sharing such a difficult yet brilliant story with her readers. There are a handful of books I’ve read with similar storylines and they’ve never gotten to me to this degree. I hate to be so vague, but this story is worth withholding the plot, the summary does not begin to explain what you will go through reading this, but it is worth every second. Although the end seems final and complete (and totally perfect) somehow I hope she somehow is inspired to continue this as a series or at least a novella. I hope you all will take a chance on this one it is probably on my top 5 best reads of all time and might be my favorite book published in 2016. This book is heavy at times, but if you pick up one book this year please please please let it be It Ends With Us. I promise you won’t regret it.","Powerful, Poignant & Complex",Verified Purchase,,94,6265254,90,Public

This book was not what I was expecting, but that's a good thing. A lot of times an author throws a wrench  in and you think ""they just messed up the entire story"". I'll admit, once I figured out what this book was actually about, I was a little upset thinking that's not what I wanted..  I was wrong. First, can I say how much I love the beginning of their love story. I loved the naked truth and everything about the roof top has me swooning. I fell in love with their story.

The story wouldn't of been the same, she needed to do this on her own. I'm happy this wasn't made into a love triangle because this story isn't a love story. It was about finding strength to do what's hard and it came full circle. Towards the end of the book I found myself no longer in my head (iit's easy to judge what people should do when you are on the outside looking in) But actually in Lilys. i found myself missing Rylle and their relationship and, dare I admit, wanting it to work. I know, it sounds crazy and as soon as the thought entered my minf, id throw it out! Yet, my heart wouldn't listen to my head. It wanted the love stoty. It wanted rooftop Ryle. It wanted the happily ever after. It wanted to give Ryle the chance to change. For things to work. I wanted to believe he could be better. My head knew it was wrong, but still those feelings still came. I loved the ending of the book and I really don't think it could of ended any other way. I finished the last sentence with a tear in my eye and a smile on my lips. I'd also like to thank the author for the message in the back. It made the story even more powerf.

This one really takes you on an emotional roller coaster.  The subject matter is not easy and at times became difficult to read.  Lily's journal entries from high school told the story of her intense first love and provided the background for Lily's turbulent feelings about her parents.  When the story opens Lily is encountering a new love; the journal entries begin to appear a bit later.  I will say right off the bat that I was immediately intrigued by the male character who was her first love.  I felt such empathy for him and his situation.  I also felt compassion for Lily because she was caught in an environment that was eating away at her, and she had no control over it nor a way to escape it.  The new love seemed like a decent guy who really cared for Lily.  Initially, their relationship seemed to fit the scenario of ""the non-relationship man who falls in love and settles down when he meets the right woman.""  Yet, as the plot unfolds with all its twists and turns it becomes SO much more than that.  At times, parts of this story were difficult for me to read but the book is definitely a journey well worth taking.  The ending is very touching, brought tears for me.

All the way through the first part, there were nothing but amazing things happening. Love happened. Dreams became realities.

It was so easy to fall for both these characters, because Colleen did such an amazing job of writing them. Lily is this amazing young lady who, despite not having the best childhood under her belt, is still full of life and dreams, and the passion to accomplish them. Ryle is sexy and funny and smart and driven. Together, they have this chemistry that flew off the pages and slapped me right in the face. It’s impossible to deny their attraction.But then there were these little things that started to crop up with Ryle. And even though they started out small, they got bigger and bigger until they were just crazy things that made me simultaneously love him, hate him, and pity him. My emotions were everywhere the farther I got in the book. But, that’s part of what made me love it so much. I didn’t want to put it down. I had to know what was going to happen, how Lily and Ryle were going to do things.I loved the way that Colleen wove Lily and Atlas’s story in using the journal. And the whole Ellen thing was brilliant too!One of the strongest elements of the writing in this book is Lily’s character development. At the beginning of the story, she’s so critical and judgmental of her mom. As the story progresses, and she finds herself in situations like what her mother has endured, she starts to understand why it wasn’t fair to judge her mother in the first place, and just how complicated and emotionally challenging relationships can be. I always saw strength in her, from the very start of the story, but that strength multiplies tenfold by the end of the book, because she’s forced to make some very difficult and painful decisions, all in the name of doing what’s best for her daughter.At the end of this story, I found my heart feeling full once more. Happy endings aren't always perfect ones, and It Ends with Us is a beautiful example of a story that has an imperfect yet satisfying conclusion.Five stars to this beautiful novel.",A gut wrenching and beautiful story!,Verified Purchase,,170,303287,320,Public

And based on posts and pre-release reviews, I expected this one to be very emotional and deep, as have all of her books been.  This one, though, especially after reading the book and then reading her note to readers, was beyond just emotional and deep.  It seeped into crevices of your being you didn't realize were there, and stirred up everything within you.  I have never experienced what Lily experienced, so I have nothing with which to compare.  But we've all had difficult life-changing decisions to come at us from time to time.  Everything leading up to Lily's biggest life-changing decision was ""I've mortgaged a piece of my heart to this book"" wonderful.  Funny, heart-warming, squishy romantic, heart-shuddering.  Lily's background with Atlas, her unique meeting Ryle, it was all such a nice, interesting read.  When it gets into the meat and the heart of things, it became cold like a hard cold stone in your heart, with your mind teeter-tottering back and forth with what you want Lily to do, how you want her to respond.  Reading Ms Hoover's note to readers was not so much icing on the cake as it was an ""aha"" moment that locked every piece of the book tightly into place in your mind and your heart.  I appreciate Ms Hoover's being able to share this story with us, her adoring reader fans.  I have so much admiration and respect for Ms Hoover for her talent, ability and humility, but for sharing that amazing talent with us in the creation of some amazing characters who are more like our friends.","This is the book that took her over the top, into the clouds of our hearts forever!",Verified Purchase,,314,135775,406,Public

I will say that I think a few of the characters are undeveloped, but the best moments of the story are the journal entries written by Lily.  When not reading about her past, the timeline skips a little too quickly for my taste, jumping over huge events and speeding through the developing relationships among the characters.

It most definitely should end with them. It Ends with Us is a bit different from CoHo’s other stories with more mature characters. There are quite a few things that are similar too, though: the amazing writing, the character-driven story, and my tears…It Ends With Us is a very strong and necessary story. It deals with some pretty heavy subject matters, and I have actually already used it as an example of something important with a young woman I know… Lily Bloom is a very strong woman, and she has built so many walls around herself and her heart that she might have been completely impenetrable, but she wasn’t. The story itself starts with some chance encounters, and it has one part of the action happening in the present, and another part in the past, where Lily reads through her old journals to try to make peace with her past and the people in it.Having empathy and understanding for other people and their problems is something I think is really important. And It Ends With Us truly made me walk a few miles in someone else’s shoes, and it definitely put some things in perspective for me. I had some pre-conceived notions about some kinds of relationships, and I really don’t think I do anymore – so kudos to CoHo for managing to really make me see things from a different point of view.Most of the story in It Ends With Us is from Lily’s point of view, and as I said above, there are parts set in the present and other parts set in the past. There is definitely a lot of heartache, but I didn’t feel completely overwhelmed by sadness until the end. The range of emotions I felt was complete, though, and I think this is one of CoHo’s strong suits. She manages to so fully make me believe in her characters, that seem so real because they’re flawed, that I immediately want their life to be the best it can be.

I glanced at the reviews, but once I saw a few people saying to just jump in blind, I did just that, and I am so happy I did. I began this book not having ANY idea about what it was about. After a few chapters, I started to get bored. Lily Bloom, had a troubled home life when she was younger, but now everything seemed ok. I anticipated that she was going to have to choose between her current prince charming and her childhood love (I had already chosen who I liked best and was worried Lily would not agree). Then all of a sudden at around the 50% mark, IT. ALL. GOT. FLIP. TURNED. UPSIDE. DOWN. I was shocked and I have no  doubt it was because I was lulled into a false sense of security and I'm wondering if Colleen did it on purpose, or if I'm just the most oblivious person on the planet.

In the simplest of terms, this book destroyed me. I went in knowing very little about the plot and theme. I think that was a good thing, but probably contributed to why I was so destroyed by it. I wasn’t expecting an emotionally heavy book, but that is what this is.I’m not sure I’ve felt this much anxiety while reading a book before. I read it fast. When I’d force myself to take a break and put it down, my hands, arms, and shoulders were actually sore from me being so tense. That should indicate just how attached and emotionally invested I get to characters and their stories.The description on Goodreads, as well as the one on the back on the book are quite deceiving. They make it out like it is a love triangle. I wouldn’t classify it as such. Lily’s relationships with Ryle and Atlas happen separately from each other. I’m not giving anything away here when I say that Atlas does come back into Lily’s life unexpectedly, but it doesn’t quite happen in the way one might think or expect. It certainly doesn’t progress the way I thought it might. So no, this isn’t a love triangle.Like I said above, I didn’t know a lot about this book when I decided to read it. I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding it’s release, but that’s about it. I’m not going to say much more that is specific to the plot, except that it is not a “light read.” It deals with emotionally heavy topics. If you’re one to look for ‘trigger warnings’ you may want to look at other reviews for those warnings. I don’t want to say much for those who don’t want to know.This book did have sweet moments, funny moments, lovely moments, but it was also heartbreaking, sad, and at times really tough to read. Thinking more on it, one reason why this book destroyed me so much is because I found myself thinking like Lily. Making excuses, saying ‘if only.’ If I reacted like this to characters in a book, what would I do if I was in Lily’s position in real life? That scared me.Lastly, I’m not sure I’d personally categorize this as a romance. Yes, it is about love and relationships at the core. Yes there’s some sex, but it is definitely not your typical romance book. That said, I would say this definition I read about romance novels does apply to it:“Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally-satisfying and optimistic ending.”(It just might not end in the way you expect it to.)Colleen Hoover wrote a novel that affected me in a way I didn’t expect. The message that you will find within these pages is deeply important. It had me evaluating myself, my thoughts, and what my “limit” would be. I think it’ll make you think about things in a different light as well.",Totally unexpected,Verified Purchase,,52,1422733,57,Public

From the beginning I knew this book was going to be emotional. And I was right. It’s not a CoHo book if you aren’t shedding some tears at some point. From the synopsis I knew there was going to be two guys in the picture. But from the beginning, I knew who I was rooting for. Then something else happened that made me question it, and then it kept repeating until I knew who I wanted her to pick by the end. The book was definitely hard to read at some points. But one thing that I can say with absolute certainty is that Lily is one heck of a strong character. The choices that she made were admirable, especially as we got closer to the end of the book. She stood by her decisions, and it was interesting seeing her thought process when certain things were happening. Her history with Atlas was heartbreaking and emotional. But after reading more about what they both went through and what they had accomplished when they met again was a bittersweet moment. It is really hard writing this review without giving too much away. There are so many things that I want to talk about but I won’t because this is one of those books that you have to go in blind.

I read one chapter (I'd actually been interrupted while reading it by a woman talking to me about the effect this book had on her) and I had to close the book after that single chapter.

It's a blessing and a curse. I'll say up front that It Ends With Us isn't my favorite Colleen Hoover book, but she pulled out all the feels from me and I ended up crying. Actual tears. It's not easy to make me cry, but Colleen Hoover has done it more than once.It Ends With Us starts out on a roof top where Lily meets Ryle (I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO PRONOUNCE HIS NAME which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine). The two have both had traumatic days for different reasons and begin to talk. Because they're complete strangers they find it easy and refreshing to be completely honest with each other in what they call ""naked truths."" I liked that these two had a connection one night but then didn't see each other again for quite some time. Ryle helps give Lily the inspiration and motivation she needed to leave the job she had at a marketing firm to start her own business--a floral shop.As part of the overall story, Lily finds and re-reads some journals that she wrote back when she was fifteen years old. I didn't love that the journal entries were written in the form of letters to Ellen Degeneres. I mean that made them unique, but also a little annoying to me. Ellen is hilarious so I can kind of understand the need to try to bring in some humor to the weightiness of the story, but that didn't quite translate as Ellen herself wasn't really present. It also served as a flashback to give Lily's backstory and setup for events to come. I'm not always a fan of flashbacks and I found myself sighing (not in a good way) when these sections came up at first, but the further into the book I got the more I wanted to know how her journals would end.It Ends With Us is a good bit different from all of Colleen Hoover's other books. In the most obvious way I can't really discuss due to spoiling, but what is the same is that I really did feel everything that Lily feels. I felt her excitement with a new relationship, the nostalgia from her past, the hurt and frustration from being let down, the confusion and battle of head versus heart. It Ends With Us is a story of gray areas and how quickly you can find yourself in the exact position you thought you of all people would never be in. And if you read the author's note at the end (read only after finishing the book) then you'll see how deeply personal It Ends With Us was for Colleen Hoover. This was a story that needed to be told.I laughed, I cried. I shook my head. I predicted. Even though It Ends With Us wasn't my favorite Colleen Hoover book, I still have to give it 5 Stars because she put me through the entire course of emotions. Any time a book can actually make me cry it deserves those 5 Stars. Have you read It Ends With Us? What did you think?

I too don't understand our didn't understand why people would stay in this but you helped me to see and understand more.I grew up in an emotionally abusive home where you always felt worthless and scared to hear what you would get called next. Not the same as physical abuse but just as emotionally scarring. It's a vicious cycle as it's what you grow up with and expect. Changing those expectations is hard and not allowing that behavior in your life is harder. I still get scared when people yell and I freeze when people yell at me. Fight or flight kicks in and I shut down. I'm not going to shut down anymore. I'm going to FIGHT thank you to authors like you and Tarryn for giving us hope and love that we will be understood and supported which is something we may not find in other places. <3","Amazing, thought provoking, emotional wreck of a novel",Verified Purchase,,118,617148,236,Public

He was a great man. Even after reading his actions my heart still bleeds for him. He was such a complex person with justifications for his faults. But as I've learned in my own life, it doesn't matter the reason when our happiness and wellbeing and that of our children are at stake. As mothers we're responsible for raising our children in a loving and safe environment.

Everything about the story itself, as well as the characters, is very powerfully eye opening!  If there has ever been a question in your mind as to how domestically abusive relationships get as far as they do, or why exactly women stay with their abusers then you absolutely have to read this book! It Ends With Us is absolutely capable of pulling emotions out of you that you didn't even know was possible. Colleen Hoover has mastered the art of developing a personality in such detail that you can't help but to relate on the most personal of levels.Everything about us humans is uncovered, leaving our otherwise hidden fragile underbellies exposed for the world to see what were capable of.  The beautiful, the nasty, the love, the hate, and even overwhelming confusion isn't merely portrayed in this book, but its felt. On. Every. Level. It's an outstanding love story within a love story within a love story.Lily, the main character, (written in first person) is no stranger to domestic violence. She grew up in an abusive home. Not so much toward herself, but to her mother.  She watched first hand as her mother was beaten regularly by her father. As an adult Lily is independent and determined to live her life exactly opposite of her mother.The men who weave themselves into her life (and her heart) are strong-willed powerful men. Both of them have overcame their own childhood struggles. They've grown into driven, successful beings, and their interactions with Lily are both unique and equally authentic. Lily feels her love AND other emotions, on a level that's so intense it becomes borderline overwhelming. Talk about a page turner!This is hands down the best book I have read in at least a year or two. Not only will I recommend it, but I will nag all of my friends until they have all read it, because if I don't have someone to talk to about it then I might die.

That didn't happen for me here - I knew she would leave Ryle and I knew she would go back to Atlas. A surprise would have been finding someone completely new.

Always. So when the pre-sale for this book opened up with nothing more than a title and author I blindly pre-ordered expecting nothing short of magic. I was not disappointed. This book is like nothing she has ever written ever before. Ever. Yes- ever. I may have mentioned a few times that I love going into books blind (at least as much as possible- sometimes this doesn't work in my favor lol see my post from Friday) and with this one I didn't even read the blurb on the back. It was a beautiful and amazing surprise. CoHo is always so good at ripping out your heart and making you wonder what the heck you just read and then she puts you back together again so you're willing to read the next book she comes out with and this book is no exception. Although I feel like instead of ripping out my heart she just gouged it and left it to bleed out slow and messy. I seriously want to just go on and on about what happened and how I felt but I don't believe in spoilers so I won't. Just know your heart will feel this one and it will feel it deep and for a long time. The magical unicorn of writing that is Colleen Hoover continues on the tradition of putting work out there that not only makes a reader feel but makes them WANT to feel. The characters are alive and real and I for one have maybe bumped Maybe Someday down to my number 2 favorite CoHo book. I feel like there is nothing else I can say other than buy this book. Do it right now. Drop everything you're doing and go buy it.My Recommendation:At this point in today's post I feel like I've made my self very clear but if not- 10 stars out of 5.

During my reading of the novel, despite feeling compelled to finish the book, at times it felt like I was reading a fanfiction off of the famous site Wattpad. Not to mention how one of the plot twist in the book is terribly similar to one of that from the popular medical drama Grey's Anatomy. One of the main love interest seems as though he is based off of Derek Shepard? Dreamy blue eyes? A neurosurgeon? I mean could she have been more obvious about it? The relationships are all based on sex and college hookup culture as well as unrealistic.

She's written so many amazing book but not in the same plot as this one.  This is close to many women's and men's heart because of the fact that it discusses what happens in real life.  Just like what she said, this is by no means a book about how an abusive person is supposed to be.  This is a book about how a person made a decision to end what an unfortunate thing she's dealing with.""Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles, rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet.""Most of us judge too easily when we hear or witness a person being abused.  It's easy for us to say that why can't they just leave or report it to the authorities, but we are not the one dealing with that problem.  For people in abusive relationship, some of them becomes to the person who abuses them and in most cases, they don't have any means to support themselves and no other choice but to stay with the person who is abusing them.With this book, Lily showed that she doesn't want to continue the cycle anymore and made the decision base on what her daughter will go through.  Not necessarily that Emerson will follow the same path, but by removing that situation around her helps her in not having to deal with a situation that Lily went through.  Ryle loves her and she's his world but that love will not solve all the problems in the world especially if it involves hitting someone.  Lily made a conscious thought of making her life and her daughter's life better by staying away from an awful situation.I do hope that anyone who reads this book who are in the same situation to think about what Lily did, even if not to follow what she did to be away from a relationship that hurts her.  At least the readers will be able to think that yes, every single one of us can stop the cycle and make it better for ourselves and the people around us.",Brilliant,Verified Purchase,,73,1979764,149,Public

I just dive in and start reading. So once I figured out that book was about domestic abuse I was even more interested. This is by far one of my favorite books by Hoover. I myself was in an abusive marriage years ago. And I can say leaving for me was one of the hardest things I've done. I had a two year old daughter to keep safe. It all came to a head when we had a very large fight and I ended up in the ER with a bruised back. That was my limit. Lucky for me I had my mom and grandma to fall back on.Being abused by someone you love is one of the worst things to experience and leaving them is a very hard choice. I really loved that this book covered so much of what these women and men go through.This book will fill your heart with love and then blow it all to hell. Just to have you fall in love again.  Lily and Ryle go through so much. And I felt for them though each page I read.  Both characters were so head strong and the story was so heart ripping!I was almost at the end of this one and thought I was going to get out of crying. Ya I was so wrong. As the last few pages concluded I could feel the tears start to stream down my face. Ya I'm a sap lol. I would have to say that out of all the stories I've read by Hoover that this one is flawless.'What determines a person's character aren't the mistakes we make.

I absolutely loved that she wrote to Ellen instead of ""Diary"" or ""Journal"".  The way we got to see her first love with Atlas through the journal while she was developing a relationship with Ryle was perfect.  I got to fall in love with them both right along with her.  I could feel how torn she was when things started to go badly.  I also grew similar to Lily so being able to relate to what she was seeing and hearing was instant and so powerful.  I don't want to give anything away, it's so much better that way.  When I started this book, I only knew that it was the most personal book that Colleen Hoover had written so far, and that made it that much better to experience the story all on my own.  When I read the last line, I wanted to know more about what happens after the hug, and if they each find love.  So hopefully there will be another story with characters for us to journey with.  Even though I wanted to know more, I still had a smile (and tears!).  I still felt the ending was great.

I also read a couple reviews saying Lily cheated but there was no cheating in the book so I’m not sure what was going on with those reviews lol.I did not get as emotional as I thought I would but I literally felt my heart break several times. I am not sure how to explain the feeling I had. This book was so heartbreaking.I was for sure going to give this book 4 stars but I was waiting on the ending to see if I’ll give it 5... The ending was probably the best ending to any book I have ever read. I didn’t cry much but the last 2 chapters I cried like a baby. I had just finished texting my friend about the book saying I didn’t cry much and I started bawling lol.This was my first Colleen Hoover book and I am looking forward to reading more of her books.,Naked Truth!,Verified Purchase,,1,6320234,13,Public

That was my first thought when I started It Ends With Us. This book was so powerful and it delivered an equally powerful message. It Ends With Us will destroy you and then it will put you back together. I'm actually struggling with what I want to write for this review because I can't even figure out how to put into words how incredible this book was and how much I loved it and how much it made me cry. I also can't stress enough the fact that you want to go into this book blind and this review isn't going to go in-depth about the book at all because it would be hard to do so without spoiling major plot lines.Everyone knows how much I love Colleen Hoover, she is my favorite author. I love her writing style and everything she writes is incredible. I haven't read a single book by her that I don't love. However, It Ends With Us is probably the best thing she has ever written. It is next level and shows just how much she has grown as an author. Throughout this whole book I found myself reacting to every little thing and feeling everything the characters were feeling, which I attributed to her incredible writing.  It also just kicked Maybe Someday out of my favorite book by Colleen spot. (And I really love Maybe Someday.)""There is no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things.""The plot of this book is extremely character driven. To say much of anything about any of the characters would give away pretty much the whole book. I will say that I loved Lily and that she is officially my favorite out all of Colleen's characters in all of her books. She is such a strong character and in the end I was so incredibly proud of her. I cried so much for her and for Ryle and for Atlas and even Lily's mom. I think the only characters I didn't shed one tear over was Marshall and Allysa. (Who I loved too by the way.)I'm a firm believer in there being books out there that help you understand something about yourself you never knew or things that you thought you knew about yourself but were so wrong about. That is the biggest thing I took away from this book. The naked truth that the way I think I would act in a certain situation isn't how I would probably act. It stripped away all of my preconceived notations and rebuilt them into something else.  It made me think.""It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.""It Ends With Us is unforgettable, powerful, shocking, realistic, and the naked truth. It's a story of love, yes, but it's also about the consequences of our actions and making the right choice no matter how hard it is.It's the kind of book where once you pick it up you won't want to put it down for anything and once you're finished it will stick with you forever.This book is the reason why Colleen Hoover is my favorite author and I want to thank her for sharing this story with all of us.

Within the first few pages, I was already highlighting lines or passages on my Kindle. This book deserves more than 5 stars. Lily falls for Ryle. Their personalities are so different but they are drawn together. But, Ryle's past comes forward in their relationship and it is one that Lily is not sure she can handle. Lily's past presents itself, too. Ryle cannot handle that. Ultimately, Lily has to decided what is best for her present and her future. I honestly cannot say anything more because when you read this book, you feel it in your soul.

I read Hopeless without ever hearing of her and loved it. I tried the Slammed Series and loved it, then I got added to the Cohorts and while it’s amazing and beautiful in there its hell.  I read Ugly Love and felt let down, Confess first time I was so p*ssy, Novemeber 9 left me staring at my paper back. I laid it down and walked off, the same with Maybe Someday. I didn’t enjoy any of them. I text my best friend who is also an avid Coho reader and super fan. I cried while texting her, “What is wrong with me? Why can’t I love her books anymore?”We’ve talked this same conversation through dozens of times after every book. I always feel so detached. I know everyone feels everything and somehow I feel nothing. I have to let the hype die down, I have to let it all sink in and then go back and read it. Then I write my reviews because I love them, I feel them. I FEEL EVERYTHING. The hype has ruined every book since I got into the group. It’s no one’s fault but it happens.  Then this book comes along and we have no clue what it’s about. I read no teasers and looked past anything talking about it. I was so excited to read and guys I FELT NOTHING. I believe now my feels is broken. I don’t know why I can’t feel it. Then again this story hits very close to home for me except I never had the good guy in my corner, and I sort of think this one hits my emotions on a level I can’t feel anymore, I turned those off many years ago and I don’t even know if a second read is going to work. Colleen is a great writer with a vivid imagination. She is funny and kind and usually normal-ish, I love her. I love her books. I just can’t seem to like them. Well on a first read anyways. NOT HER FAULT. I’m going ahead and reviewing this book as a 5 star because I know it is, not because I felt it but because all her books have been a 5 star read for me (eventually), it’s not her fault this story line feels as though it could’ve been pulled from the depths of my own personal hell. In my story even Ryle would have been a good guy. I’m glad she wrote this and so many have flourished and healed from it. People need to write fiction about reality to give hopefulness where it’s truly needed. I hope my second read will prove my review correct and even if it doesn’t I know it’s my own messed up non therapy going problem. Continue to write beautiful words Mrs. Hoover-Fred Water and I will continue to read and hope one day I can feel this euphoric feeling everyone else does. It’s a slow process so be patient with me, I’m trying.P.s. I am not bipolar or off my meds (or rocker) it’s just really hard to put into words how reading makes me feel lately. You are amazing, just incase you didn’t figure that out in all that rambling.<< OK I may be off my rocker a tad if I think in 2k reviews you’re actually reading it, but hey it only takes one time.",Continue to write beautiful words Mrs. Hoover-Fred Water,Verified Purchase,,526,81095,423,Public

It’s a book about being strong when you have nothing to keep you from collapsing. And, it’s the type of book you will never forget.

Colleen Hoover brought these characters to life and I have never felt like I actually lived through everything with the characters like I did when reading this one. I also cannot say enough good things about this because it is simply that beautiful. However, I will say that there will be moments when you absolutely HATE everyone in the story.

If you think of your average romance novel, the climax of the story is when the couple finally gets together, but this isn’t an average story by far. It’s a journey more than anything, it’s lifelike and introspective, it’s a process and you don’t really see where it’s headed at all times, until you do.I would recommend this story for anyone, anyone at all.

I didn't want any bias other than me knowing I will love it because, duh! It's by Colleen Hoover. I don't know how she does it but every book is better than the last. I keep telling people that's my favorite book then she writes a new one and surprise I have a new favorite.  Well this book didn't let me down.  I fell in love with all the characters, even when I didn't want to.  She made it so you couldn't help routing for the guy you weren't supposed to.  Wanting the heroine to forgive him when you know she shouldn't.  She made you question why you felt this way.  That not everything is black and white.  That there is good and evil in all of us. Maybe we are all just people who sometimes do bad things.  Don't get me wrong, there is true evil in the world, but my hope is that there is more good.

This is not the classic love story you will expect with the ""normal"" happy ending. I think this story was very well written, very Colleen! I love that no matter what the story is about, she always adds some funny dialogs. All the characters are amazing. There was a point where I hated Colleen because of what she did to Ryle, because she described this character so well that you ended up loving him! The point of this book in my opinion is that! how hard is for a person who loves so much another one, to take such a big decision! How easy it is from us reading the book to love the characters and not understanding Lily's point.

I’ve read all of her books and I’ll read any she puts out. However, Hoover openly admits that her books aren’t meant to be deep or meaningful; they’re simply entertaining. That is, until she wrote New York Times bestseller It Ends With Us.Hoover advises readers to go into the novel blind and with as little information about the plot as possible. I took her advice and am grateful that I did because It Ends With Us is shocking and heartbreaking in the best way possible. That being said, all I’ll say about the storyline is that it’s told through the first person perspective of a headstrong young woman, Lily Bloom, who falls in love with a charming and mysterious neurosurgeon named Ryle.From the very first page, the novel is captivating and intense in typical Colleen Hoover fashion. It starts out flirty and a little provocative and I thought I had this book all figured out early on. But about half way through—note that this is not to say that the first half is just fluff—the story takes a dark and twisted turn that I was not expecting.From there, I was forced to stay up until the early hours of the morning to finish the novel. I cried, laughed, got angry, cried some more. This book made me question my own beliefs and made me see through an entirely different perspective than the one I’d been looking through for most my life, something that isn’t easy to do and something that is the hallmark of a great novel.I should mention that this book is not for the young or faint of heart. It is painfully honest and real and features adult themes and mature subject matter. However, if you’re up for it, It Ends With Us is a story full of well-developed characters, a riveting plot that avoids clichés, and commanding, clever writing. This story is deeply personal to the author and it swiftly became my favorite Hoover novel. If someday I can tell a story half as good—and important—as this one, I’ll be very happy.",I took her advice and am grateful that I did because It Ends With Us is shocking and heartbreaking in the best way possible,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,58552340,,
