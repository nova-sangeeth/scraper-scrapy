Phil in Magnolia,amzn1.account.AGS6HKYNXMJR7UT6XFJGZJUGSGTQ/,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2019",0,,https://www.amazon.com/Aprilaire-210-Filter-Whole-Purifiers/product-reviews/B005AIN8YW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Aprilaire offers four filter versions for my particular home HVAC system. I have now purchased and am in the process of using (for comparison) three of the four styles available (the two 213 rated versions, and the 216), two ordered from Amazon (the 213CBN and 216). (My own home had the model 210 originally installed. My HVAC service company installed the 213 model when service was most recently performed, and I have now decided to upgrade to the 213CBN and 216 models and have purchased them from Amazon).As stated above my personal choice is to use either the 213CBN, or the 216 version. The 216 has the ability to remove significantly more particles of all sizes down to 0.3 μm. The 213CBN includes activated carbon filter material for better removal of odors and VOCs. Both are quite a bit more expensive than either the 210 or 213, and have potentially shorter life (6 mo vs 12 mo). I feel that the added cost is well worthwhile - my home requires only one of these filters, and if I have to replace them somewhat more frequently in order to ensure the best possible filtration for air in my home, I consider that to be money well spent.The key difference between these filters from my point of view is this - any of the filters rated at MERV 13 or greater is going to provide a very high level of filtration, and the MERV 16 rated filter is really superior filtration. According to the EPA paper I reference below, anything above MERV 16 is considered to be a HEPA filter. Residential filters are only required to provide an efficiency of MERV 6 or greater (per ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2007).The filters that I received from purchasing here on Amazon were authentic OEM Aprilaire products in the proper packaging. I purchased from Amazon itself, not one of the third party sellers.Below are more details of the various models available, to help explain the differences:- 210 Clean Air Filter for Aprilaire Whole-Home Air Purifiers, MERV 11, For Dust--- least expensive (MSRP 52.99)--- described by Aprilaire as effective for removing airborne particles including dust, pollen, mold spores, bacteria, and pet dander--- rated MERV 11--- filter life stated by Aprilaire as 'up to 12 months'--- MERV 9-12 typical applications** described as: ""Superior residential, Better commercial buildings, Hospital laboratories""--- MERV 11 particle removal efficiency is not rated for particle sizes 0.3 to 1 μm, 65-80% for 1 to 3 μm, >85% for 3 to 10 μm (see reference below for source of this information)- 213 Healthy Home Air Filter for Aprilaire Whole-Home Air Purifiers, MERV 13, for Most Common Allergens--- slightly more expensive (MSRP 59.99)--- described by Aprilaire as effective for removing common airborne allergens including dust, pollen, mold spores, bacteria, pet dander and dust mites--- rated MERV 13--- filter life stated by Aprilaire as 'up to 12 months'--- MERV 13-16 typical applications include: ""Superior commercial buildings, Hospital inpatient care, General surgery""--- MERV 13 particle removal efficiency is <75% for particle sizes 0.3 to 1 μm, > 90% for 1 to 10 μm (see reference below for source of this information)- 213CBN Odor Reduction Air Filter for Aprilaire Whole-Home Air Purifiers, MERV 13, for Odors and Most Common Allergens--- most expensive (MSRP 94.99)--- described by Aprilaire as effective for removing common airborne allergens + odors, including dust, pollen, mold spores, bacteria, pet dander, dust mites, pet and cooking odors, and VOCs--- rated MERV 13 (plus activated Carbon for odor and VOC reduction)--- filter life stated by Aprilaire as 'up to 6 months'--- MERV 13-16 typical applications include: ""Superior commercial buildings, Hospital inpatient care, General surgery""--- MERV 13 particle removal efficiency is <75% for particle sizes 0.3 to 1 μm, > 90% for 1 to 10 μm (see reference below for source of this information)- 216 Allergy and Asthma Air Filter for Aprilaire Whole-Home Air Purifiers, MERV 16, for Allergy and Asthma Triggers--- most expensive (MSRP 94.99)--- described by Aprilaire as effective for removing up to 99% of allergy and asthma triggers, including dust, pollen, mold spores, bacteria, pet dander, dust mites, viruses, and the airborne particulates associated with tobacco smoke and smog--- rated MERV 16--- filter life stated by Aprilaire as 'up to 6 months'--- MERV 13-16 typical applications include: ""Superior commercial buildings, Hospital inpatient care, General surgery""--- MERV 16 particle removal efficiency is > 95% for particle sizes 0.3 to 10 μm (see reference below for source of this information)** Ref: US EPA publication EPA 402-F-09-002, revised August 2009, ""Residential Air Cleaners, second edition, A Summary of Available Information""(VOC = volatile organic compounds, organic chemicals such as formaldehyde that are released from paint and plastics into the air)",OEM Aprilaire Replacement Filters - Model Differences Explained,"Style: 216 ALLERGY, ASTHMA, & VIRUSSize: Single Pack (1)Verified Purchase",196 people found this helpful

As part of this installation, we now need these new larger accordion style filters. When the installation team showed us the new filter, they told us we would need to replace the filter every quarter. I then asked what the price is and where I could purchase these filters and was told I could purchase them directly from the installer at a rate of around $60. Initially I didn't think much of it... I mean, we just spent a ton of money on a new AC/heating system, so what's $60 at this point. I luckily decided to hold off on purchasing any extra filters at that time.Later that day I checked Amazon and was able to find the exact same filter for far less, thus I've purchased a couple filters directly from Amazon.The filter is easy to switch out and does a great job. To be honest, I was actually quite surprised at how easy and how quickly I was able to make the switch. I've also discovered that there is no need to replace the air filter every 4 months (every quarter). In fact, we waited an entire year before replacing our filter and the air filter still looked in great shape. We also have a yellow lab dog and two kids, so I think you'll be in good shape delaying replacement unless you're doing a lot of construction work in your house.Lastly and most importantly, we've noticed a decrease in dust and allergens in our house and have been breathing much better since the switch to our new system.I definitely recommend this air filter and think you'll be hard-pressed to find this filter for cheaper than what you can find it on Amazon.If you found my review helpful, please let me know below.

Consider these important points Aprilaire may not tell you about the Aprilaire 216 modelI don't see anyone discussing the last two hereAprilaire 216 Specific problems1.  Problem: Clogging.  Replace these often.  Mine is 70% clogged after six weeks of Spring/Summer and totally clogged after twelve.2.  Problem: Water condensation.  Humid outside?  A/C running all the time in that Summer heat wave?  Look out for water buildup on the wall of the coil section of your unit (above the flame usually).  My HVAC technician was standing there and pointed out water droplets forming up on the surface of my new Carrier central air system where the coil is located.  Water was slowly dripping.  ""That water buildup is not normal. It is caused by that filter.  It is not letting air pass by the coils at a rate the unit is designed for"" .  It's harmless but be aware"".  I put a towel down.3. Problem?  Furnace fire hazard.  When you inevitably forget to change the 216 filter it will clog up to a dangerous level. In Winter, when the furnace is running longer, the air can't get through the heat exchanger fast enough.  Too much heat can lead to a house fire. Lookup the anatomy of a forced air furnace.  One of the components is the ""heat exchanger"". The flames push their heat into the heat exchanger.  The exchanger gets extremely hot.  The only reason it doesn't start a dangerous situation (like a fire) is the giant blower nearby ""forces"" the air throughout your home.  With that 216 filter, inevitably neglected and clogged, you might as well not have a fan.  This alone is probably why my HVAC manual does not mention the Apriiaire 216 even though it is designed to accept this series.I use the Aprilaire 216 filter in the Spring and Summer (putting up with the water buildup)",Three Important Considerations,"Style: 216 ALLERGY, ASTHMA, & VIRUSSize: Value Pack (2)Verified Purchase",16 people found this helpful

The builder provided a #210 MERV-11 filter. In January 2020, when a family member was having health issues that might have been triggered by allergens, I switched to the #216 MERV-16 filter. Although we did not perceive a difference in air quality, I liked knowing that the filter was removing more particles from the air. I changed them every 4 months, and things seemed fine.Then, when the polar vortex hit us in an Austin, TX suburb last week, our system struggled to keep up, unable to maintain our heating set point. I thought that the furnace was not sized for the severe cold weather we were experiencing. Then I realized that the furnace was cutting off every 60 to 90 minutes. After cutting off, the t-stat would still be calling for heat, but the furnace would not run again until I restarted it by flipping the breaker. For 4 nights, I set an hourly alarm to wake up and see if the furnace needed to restart.When I was finally able to reach our HVAC company, they first asked if our filter was dirty. When I told them that I had just replaced our allergen-catching filter in January, they immediately told me to try removing the filter. Everything functioned normally with no filter or with a MERV-11 filter. With the 16, air flow was impeded, and the air coming off the heating element was hot enough to trigger a safety shutoff after 60-90 minutes.Now I am stuck with an extra unopened package of 2 #216 filters, costing $144, which I received on 12/20/2020.

The individual boxes with the filters in them were also only cardboard.  Problem is they were left on my house's stoop by UPS.  Which isn't the seller's fault, however they should probably have thought of that possibility when they decided not to cover the filters with any plastic.  It rained before I got home to get the package off the stoop.  Rain and Cardboard do not mix.  The water had penetrated all the way down to the filter since there was no plastic lining covering the filters.  They only got slightly wet and seemed to have dried fine so no harm/no foul.

One for the main portion of the house and another for the master suite.  Each of the units is equipped with a single Aprilaire filter system in the return air duct and located in our attic.  We have had two sets of filters fail in the past 12 months.  The failure mechanism seems to be the glue which holds the filter media to the top rail.  The glue gives way at some point in the filters life-cycle and the filter collapses and falls to the bottom.  The failure results in a total loss of filtration to the coil which over time will decrease the efficiency of the system as the coil becomes dirty with no upstream filter.  This product seems to be well constructed and uses what otherwise appear to be quality materials, which is what I expect for the cost.The first time we experienced this issue we reported the problem to the supplier.  They acknowledged there were a number of reported failures of this type and changes to the manufacturing process had been made to eliminate this issue.  To the suppliers credit we were even provided with a replacement filter at no charge.  As no process is without some issues we accepted the explanation and very much appreciated the replacement filter.  Good customer service is difficult to come by and the supplier did what they could to remedy the situation.Roll the clock forward several months and we are experiencing the same problem with the reportedly modified design.  What now?  Are others experiencing similar problems and what are we to do with the expensive systems that don't work?",Aprilaire 213 Replacement Filter Glue Failure,Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

They told me the problem I had with these Aprilaire filters is very common. Terrible product and a 100% waste of hard-earned money!  I would have posted this earlier, but just now remembered where I had purchased them.",Terrible product and a 100% waste of hard-earned money,Style: 213 HEALTHY HOMESize: Single Pack (1)Verified Purchase,12 people found this helpful
