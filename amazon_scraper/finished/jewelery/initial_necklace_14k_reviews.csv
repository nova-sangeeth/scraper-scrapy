I bought it for my 7-year-old daughter as a gift, thinking that with nearly 5 out of 5 stars and 2000+ reviews it  was a no-brainer. Well, the item came and it's unacceptably tiny - even for a 7-year-old. It's the cheapest of costume jewelry and I'm ashamed. I could have gotten something at the corner discount store for $5 that would have been so much nicer. No one would GUESS they were ordering something like this unless they looked at ALL the pictures. They need to put the pics with people wearing the item as the first picture to avoid disappointing customers, as a necklace this size is just something you would never encounter. There should also be a more descriptive product title, e.g. ""miniature heart necklace."" Now reading these reviews I can that on top of the tiny size I see many, many people complaining that the necklace either breaks or discolors terrible in the first couple of weeks. This is dishonest.
