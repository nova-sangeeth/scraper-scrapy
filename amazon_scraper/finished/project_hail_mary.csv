That's cool, I'm sure the author spent a lot of time thinking about these things, because it shows in the writing. Endlessly describing a problem, then figuring out the solution. It helps that the protagonist is apparently a bit super-human in his knowledge, especially for everything needed exactly fitting within the nice confines of the plot.Will I finish it? I'm trying, really I am. But midway through, the plot seems to be stuck with endless communication sessions with an alien and I've virtually lost interest as to whether they figure it out or not.

The movie was incredible in that they actually followed the book closer than 99% of other films based on books. It remains my favorite movie of the last 15 years or so as well. I don't know anyone (personally) that loves either of them as much as I do.With that said, I was REALLY looking forward to Artemis. It was good...but, it was certainly not in the same caliber as The Martian was (at least not for me). I enjoyed it a lot, however and appreciated how author Andy Weir chose to go in a completely different direction and not just rehash another similar story, which I am certain would have been great as well.As a result, I was cautious regarding Project Hail Mary. It sounded a little too close to The Martian, but yet, also different in that the circumstances simply could not be more opposite and the stakes so much higher. I'm trying to figure out the best way to summarize without giving too much away from this utterly compelling novel. As I read several reviews, I noticed a recurring theme: SCIENCE. Lots and LOTS of science. Holy cow, they were right. Many years ago I read Apollo 13 and Jim Lovell and his co-writer, try as they might, simply could not dumb down Orbital Mechanics anywhere near enough for me to have even a minor clue as to what they were attempting to say...I just skipped 90% of it and hoped that the sentences written afterwards, would help to make sense of what I had just skimmed over. I'm a lot of things, but a math wizard is definitely not one of them. Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) had an amazing talent for dumbing-down the science of what he was trying to explain in ways that genuinely made sense (most of the time). Not everyone has this talent, and I would say Andy Weir falls squarely in between. He's certainly better than Jim Lovell, but not quite as good as Crichton. But then again, outside of a science textbook, I haven't really read anything with quite as MUCH science as Project Hail Mary. So maybe he's just as good, but he just puts more science into his books than Crichton, maybe that's it...? Either way, be prepared for a lot of astonishingly interesting science within the pages of this novel...and I DO mean a LOT. I don't say this to make you wary or steer you away...on the contrary, Andy Weir has a special talent for making hard science truly entertaining.The book opens with an absolutely amazing and frightening premise: an astronaut awakes from an induced coma to find the only other two people on board have died at some point along their journey...but it gets worse. He has no idea who he is, or why he's on the ship, and oh yeah, they look to be a long way from home. A really, REALLY long way from home. In fact, the sun he sees isn't actually OUR sun at all. He's managed to leave our solar system entirely. And he has no idea why.((Minor Spoilers)) The book goes through some clever flash-backs, which set the stage for why the mission happens, and slowly, carefully explains how they managed to get so far away from earth in such a short amount of time. Basically, earth's sun seems to be dying. At the rate of decay, we have maybe 19 years left before the gradual cooling has catastrophic consequences resulting in the death of billions (best guess). Why the sun is dimming is quite the conundrum in the first place. Turns out it really isn't dying, it's being killed by an outside source...which turns out to be easily the greatest find in history. It's alien life, and they are using the sun for food, essentially. It's alien life, but not intelligent life. But still, wow! ALIENS, right???After this monumental discovery, and some tremendous research done by the most improbable scientist, the investigation into what is happening and why and what to do about it expands exponentially to other nations in order to pool all the resources possible to hopefully save the sun, and by extension, the human race as well. They learn. A LOT. A plan is put together, and with the help of the newly discovered microscopic alien life, which can also double as a power source (along with a few other nifty surprises), they begin to create one last, Hail Mary that could very well be the last chance we might have to save earth. It's audacious. It's dangerous, and it is absolutely critical that it succeed.As our astronaut's memory slowly unravels, so does his identity: Ryland Grace. He's a teacher on earth. Just a science teacher. Not even a college professor. He's amazingly smart, though. But he's no astronaut...and certainly not one who would volunteer to go on a one-way mission to another solar system to ""try"" and save humanity. Yet here he is. Alone. light years from earth, trying to solve the biggest riddle in all of human history. Ryland accepts his situation, such as it is, with relative indifference (for the most part). It doesn't matter HOW he got here. He's here now and he may as well use that time to be as productive as possible, right? Along the way, he unravels even more information regarding the microscopic alien life which is slowly dimming our sun during some additional flashbacks. The aliens, dubbed, ""Astrophage"" are quite the galactic plague as it turns out. Stars all over the galaxy are also losing their light, all due to the little buggers. All that is, except one particular star named, Tau Ceti. Now why would that one star be unaffected by Astrophage, when every single star around it has been affected to some degree. The plan is to go there and figure it out and send the information back, hopefully in time to save the sun before the damage to earth is beyond repair.There is an incredible amount of stuff going on. The story switches from Tau Ceti to flashbacks of how the whole mission was planned and implemented (which is VERY entertaining, especially Director Stratt, who may actually be my favorite character in the entire novel). Weir is becoming quite adept at building tension, and abruptly switching the story from Tau Ceti back to earth and building more of the backstory then switching back to Tau Ceti. Keeping it all in check and most importantly, interesting all while mixing in a healthy dose of science, which I am to understand is pretty much all genuine, is quite the juggling act. I have long known science can be astronomically entertaining (see what I did there?) when done right...but unfortunately very few people in a position to teach science actually know the best way to create that interest in others. I can say without reservation, Andy Weir definitely knows how to do it...at least in written form.There is so much I want to say more regarding this truly phenomenal story, but I simply cannot without ruining a lot of the fun and surprises revealed along the way...and it is killing me to keep it locked in. Though I labeled a spoiler warning earlier, I don't think it gave away any more than what the author himself has revealed in interviews he has done regarding the book, and what you can glean from reading the summary here and just a couple other reviews. Tying all of that science together is truly astonishing to me. The creativity to put it into a novel that is remarkably exciting to read is nothing more than incredible talent. Kudo's to Andy Weir for not just hitting a home run, Project Hail Mary is a Grand Slam all the way. I truly did not want this story to end. By the way, I enjoyed the ending quite a bit. I don't know if everyone will. But it was fine for me. I think the ending screams ""sequel"" at some point too. A lot was left open-ended (IMO) and I wouldn't mind reading a follow-up to this. It doesn't HAVE to happen, but there are a lot of ways where the story could go if Andy chose to do it. Just sayin'.Just run out and buy this book.","Astonishing, Fun, Entertaining, Fantastic",Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,10670,1776,3515,Public

In other words, lightning DOES strike the same place twice.But you don't need to search the web for this information.  If you want proof that lightning strikes twice, just read Andy Weir's newest book, Project Hail Mary, and you'll see that Weir has created a giant sci-fi bestseller, in the same electric path as The Martian.Ryland Grace has a puzzle on his hands.  He wakes up without a clue as to where he is, but he seems to be alone except for a computer AI that was keeping him alive. Unfortunately it didn't seem to be doing the same for two others in his ... wherever he is ... as he notes the decayed corpses in their creches on the ... well, it's a ship.  A space ship. And bit by bit Grace puts the pieces of the puzzle together.An alien microbe has been discovered. Ryland Grace is brought on to the science team to learn more about the life form because Grace, currently a middle school science teacher, wrote papers about the notation that there does not need to be water to create life.  Only in a biozone such as Earth's would water be needed, but other building blocks could be used in other systems.The science community as a whole mocked Grace, which is why he left and went on to teach kids, but now, he may be the best suited to understand this new life form. And as he remembers more and more, he also remembers that this life form is feeding on the energy output of the sun, which is decreasing the energy that gets to Earth, which spells disaster - as in the end of all life as currently known - on Earth if something isn't done.Scientists discover that Sol isn't the only star that is losing its energy output - likely due to the alien consumption, but that there is one star, in the center of all the known stars losing their energy, that remains constant with its output.  In which case, the answer to the survival for Earth is likely found there, at Tau Ceti.The world's best scientific minds come together (by force and coercion) to create a ship that can get to Tau Ceti in twelve years (using the alien microbe as fuel) with shuttle pods to bring back answers to how to save the planet, but for the crew, it's a one-way trip.Knowing why he's there is only the first puzzle for Grace.  Now he has to figure out how to save Earth.  There's a very small window of time for him to discover the way to save the human race and get the answers sent back.  Take too long and the shuttles will return to a dead planet.This book is amazing.Author Andy Weir brings us back to the magic that made The Martian so successful - an abandoned scientist trying to survive.  But Ryland Grace's story is more complicated because he's not just trying to survive, but also help humanity survive.There's lots and lots of science - which is part of Weir's writing signature - and there's also a really wonderful story.It's hard for me to tell you just what I liked about this book because anything I write will be a spoiler and a huge part of the joy in this book is making the discoveries with Ryland Grace.Grace is our main character, but through the liberal use of flashbacks, we have a full cast of characters - at least one quite important to the story. Everyone is unique and individual which makes it easy to read, but just as with The Martian, where Mark Watney's personality carries the story, Ryland Grace here is the smart-mouth, sometimes funny, obsessed scientist infusing his personal tastes into his discoveries. He's also quite smart - which is good since he will need his intellect to save all of humanity.This is a page-turner. I did not want to put this book down. Neither did my 21 year old son who picked up my copy after I was well into it and finished it before I did. And days later he's still talking about how much he liked it and quoting sections of it to me at the dinner table.I hope Ballantine Books will do a very large print run because this is going to be huge seller and you definitely don't want to miss out on the biggest thing to come out in 2021.Looking for a good book?

The best way I can describe it is that Andy Weir watched the film adaptation of his own first book and thought ""Wow! I should write a book like that!""As many other reviewers have mentioned, this book has a lot of the same building blocks that made The Martian so much fun: lone astronaut incredibly far from Earth, detailed scientific problem-solving, and light, cheesy humor.  It's a nice blend.  Weir also does a great job of writing the crisis moments as page-turners where the book is hard to put down.That being said, the book isn't perfect.  I would rank it a fairly distant second to The Martian but ahead of Artemis.  Without going into spoilers, the setting for the book overall feels significantly more contrived than in either of Weir's previous books.  It was fairly easy to imagine Mark Watney on Mars in 10-20 years, so everything in The Martian felt very realistic and grounded.  Here, not so much.  The main character in Project Hail Mary also feels generally less likeable and less human than Watney did.  There were chunks of the book where I genuinely did not care whether the mission succeeded - I just was not as invested as I was in Mark Watney getting home from Mars.All in all, this book is worth a read if you like Andy Weir's other work.  It's probably worth a read anyway - it's a very good book.

If you are going to use antimatter as a power source you have at least three challenges: 1)Where do you get the antimatter; 2)How do you store it; 3)How do you use it?  Two out of three are explained by obviously incorrect mechanisms and the third is pretty implausible. 1)Antineutrino/Neutrino production supposedly occurs via pair production in thermal proton collisions.  I suppose this channel is conceivable, but it would proceed via a vitual Z boson, which is a neutral particle about 90 times the mass of the proton that interacts only weakly.  ""Weakly"" is the key word here.  The crosssection for such an interaction would be fantastically tiny.  I don't know whether it would take the age of the universe to observe production of a singly such pair, but I suspect it would be something like that.  2)Storing the neutrinos is supposedly accomplished via a miraculous cell membrane opaque to neutrinos.  The miracle is how such a membrane would be evolved, since there is no substance in the known universe that would give the cell the slightest start in this direction. 3)This is the worst -- the neutrinos and antineutrinos supposedly annihilate into photons. I guess the author thought this was likely since charged antiparticles like positrons annihilate into photons.  This is because they are charged.  Neutral neutrinos do not couple at all to photons. Period. Full stop. I don't really know what a confined bunch of thermal energy neutrinos would do, but I think probably nothing since the only decays available via the weak coupling are into products far more massive than the available energies. I'm not positive about that, but one thing for sure -- they are not going to annihilate into photons.There were other lapses of scientific plausibility, such as a casual disregard for momentum conservation when the super-cells blast out photons, for some reason in only one direction, and then left passively on the plate to be scraped off by a mechanical arm. And a few other, but the particle physics impossibilities are by far the worst.As an adventure story it's reasonably well written, although it goes on far too long with one crisis after another being solved by combining human and alien technology.

The main storyline and the flashbacks (or the moments in which Ryland gets his memory back) are well spaced out. None feel too overpowering. Every character was explained so well that I could easily imagine them and why they made the decisions they did. His entire journey is just... I'm not sure I have the right words... unbelievable. I couldn't put the book and just had to know how his story evolves. There were moments where I just sad there crying or where I was overly excited and happy because I could feel exactly what he was going through.

So were the parts about publishing/academia and how the main character (a middle school teacher) was suddenly promoted to be an astronaut -- just pure fantasy.  I also had issues with some of the humor - it seemed hokey/jokey, esp. when naming planets/natural phenomenon, or naming devices.But the main con was the over-over explanations of the science, which made me feel like I was reading a textbook at times or listening to someone really really dull over explain; this needed serious editing, because it really talked down to the reader, and, not only that, but much of the knowledge was broad, but not deep.So this was more like mind candy and not really a deep read.",Too much explaining,Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,224,37,1581707,Public

Watney’s an engineer, and every problem presents itself as an engineering challenge. Now Weir has come out with a new novel, Project Hail Mary, and it’s much the same. A biologist-turned-middle-school-teacher named Ryland Grace is alone light-years from Earth on a suicide mission to save the human species. But his first job is to save himself. And the challenges he faces demand solutions that only clever engineering and a knowledge of science can solve.This book has a lot going for it. It’s suspenseful. Even hard to put town at times. Laugh-out-loud funny on occasion. Weir takes great care to base events on known physical, chemical, and biological properties. And the portrayal of alien life-forms is intriguing and seems plausible. But in the end it’s science fiction only an engineer could love. Again and again, for page after tedious page, Ryland Grace tackles engineering problems to address a succession of threats and emergencies that come out of the woodwork (as it were). Grace—or, rather, Andy Weir—is devilishly clever, but it gets old fast.Here’s what happensRyland Grace is happily enjoying the adulation of his middle-school science students. Years earlier, a paper he had written as a rising young biologist challenged the accepted wisdom that all life requires water. The reaction among exobiologists was fast and furious, and Grace was driven from his research position at a university. Now, that same paper has forced him back into the public eye. A microscopic alien life-form called “Astrophage” is gobbling up the sun’s energy, and Grace has come to the attention of the extraordinary woman leading the international to save humanity from it. That effort is a Moon Shot to the power of ten or a hundred, and Eva Stratt commands all the Earth’s resources to address the threat. Including Ryland Grace, whether he likes it or not.In case you haven’t guessed, Andy Weir is a lot stronger on science and engineering than he is on international politics. The friendly global effort he posits is preposterous. It’s inconceivable to me that an existential threat, no matter how imminent, would induce the Americans, the Chinese, and the Russians to band together in a united effort engaging all their military and economic resources. Not going to happen.Not to belabor the tale, Grace assists Stratt in a breakneck campaign to construct an interstellar spaceship and train the crew of three selected to take it to the Tau Ceti system. There, Earth scientists have concluded, lies the origin of the Astrophage. Then a whole sequence of things go wrong, and Grace himself ends up on the starship Hail Mary—alone. Because his two crewmates have died en route. And to make matters worse, he wakes from a coma with amnesia. It takes him a long, long time to figure out where he is and what happened to take him there. The upshot is, Ryland Grace is “all that stands between humanity and extinction.” And then the really big surprises start coming. . .About the authorComputer programmer Andy Weir (1972-) self-published The Martian in 2011 and created such a stir that Crown Publishing Group picked it up and turned it into a bestseller. The book is often cited as one of the best science fiction novels of recent years. He grew up in Milpitas, California, and attended (but did not graduate from) the University of California, San Diego. He has written four novels and a slew of short stories, comics, graphic novels, and other materials.","Devilishly clever, but it gets old fast",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,12455,1497,221,Public

His second novel, Artemis, was not quite as revered. Although I personally loved it, it had a lot of similarities as The Martian. The main character just seemed to be a gender bent version of Mark.Project Hail Mary is different, and is my favorite Andy Weir book to date. Firstly, I must say there is not a single swear word in the entire book. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it was disappointing, but it was an obvious choice.The first part of the novel may be a bit slow. You are disjointed and have no idea what is going on, because the main character, Ryland, is disjointed and has no idea of what is going on. He has lost his memory and he seems to be alone in space.The novel is a combination of real time events as well as memory flash backs. It makes for a very thrilling narrative. Then pops in my favorite character ever of any book - Rocky. I won’t tell you much about him because it would spoil everything. But I love him. I will buy action figures of him. . .

The main reason I'm writing this now is because I know there were some readers turned off by excessive cursing in The Martian as well as Artemis. Weir must have decided that his legacy may well be in the classroom (kind of like Ender's Game) and has toned it down. I think regardless of his reasons, it is an excellent choice. I think I've run into two F words at 50% in. They're not completely gratuitous, but classroom editions could delete them easily.

And if the book was just that, it would be excellent. It's well paced. The central problem is introduced quickly. The ""out of the frying pan into the fire"" moments are not just brought up and tossed-away but usually lead to an understanding or technique that is revisited later. It is a page-turner. Each separate incident is intriguing while constantly driving the main story forward.But (here come the spoilers)The stakes are large here. Not just the survival of the Grace, but the survival of the human race. He must travel to a distant star to find the reason that that star is not being eaten alive by a single-celled organism that is eating the earth.What differentiates this book from The Martian is the relationship that develops between Grace and Rocky. . .a hard-shelled -- arthropod (?) -- from an alien world who is at the distant star making an effort to solve the same problem for ITS home world.There is a sequence (again, a similarity to the Martian) where they must learn to communicate. Even though Rocky is not anthropomorphic, you develop a sense of its personality and the norms of its race.We learn that Rocky's entire crew has died during the journey to the star, and furthermore that one of the practices of its race is to watch each other sleep. When Rocky asks Grace to watch it sleep, it's emotional and heartbreaking and the entire relationship between the two characters grows and strengthens from there.Watching their friendship develop while their scientific skill sets mesh together to solve problem gives the book a weight that the Martian just didn't have and I don't think many sci-fi authors are capable of pulling off.  That this came from an author who so far has shown more willingness to write about chemical reactions than interpersonal interactions is especially enheartening.The last chapter was just. So.

This is a well-written story about a quest to save Earth as well as a planet in a neighboring galaxy, both of which are endangered by the same threat.  Author Andy Weir has come up with a plausible scenario that only a fertile and imaginative mind could conjur without sounding ridiculous.His newest novel is crammed with science and ingenuity, taking the reader on an intestellar journey that could easily have been over written and turned into a pure math and science tome.  But Mr. Weir avoids this while still periodically challenging your memories of science and math probably left far behind in your high school years.

He does so in a good way, adding subtle humor and sarcasm as needed to lighten the mood during unexpected (and serious) challenges, and all the while allowing his characters to learn more about themselves and their true capabilities.

The creativity in this story is exceptional. It is hard to find new ideas in SF that don’t come across as re-dos of old ideas. A lot of science-related research was clearly done in the development of the story. I am a fan of hard science fiction and this is a prime example of it. Bravo!!From a literary standpoint, this is a dual-timeline novel. The main story line forms one timeline, with the secondary timeline consisting mostly of backstory. Further, the first-person protagonist is the main character in both timelines. A challenge with this approach is that the author builds up suspense in the main timeline and then pulls us over to the secondary timeline where there is often little or no suspense. The suspense vanishes, only to return later on. A possible solution to this would have been to suppress details in the secondary timeline. This would have shortened the book, which I think would be a good idea. I read the Kindle version and, when I thought it a bit long, I checked the length of the hardcopy book: 496 pages. In my opinion at least 100 pages could be removed from the hardcopy. In general, detail is included in a novel to make it appear more believable. Detail in the backstory could have been brushed over.There is a hint of the “Hero’s Journey” storyline in this story. It has a twist that didn’t set well with me.

Project Hail Mary is not The Martian Redux, nor is it another telling of Artemis. It starts with a mystery that wrapped inside another mystery, and then it becomes a story of friendship and courage that takes an unexpected turn.The Sun's output has mysteriously diminished, threatening Earth's ecosphere as a whole. In Michael Crichton-like fashion, our hero comes to the problem because of some tangentially related research he'd done in the past, research that made him a pariah who escapes to teaching middle-school science. It's something he's quite good at, and it makes him an unlikely hero in our save-the-world story. He's still his own man, and throughout his saga, he stays true to himself.  There's no magical transition from ordinary man to superhero, and that makes him all the more realistic.Some might quibble with the plot-science used in the book, but at the same time, it is a novel that doesn't need to beg for suspension of disbelief. The devices Weir uses are believable enough, and if he got this or that a little wrong, so what -- it's not glaring enough to be irritating.Bottom line, as the onion of a story gets peeled, there are times it will make you want to cry for the characters, make you cheer for them and make you want them to succeed.

What a ride! I didn’t think Weir could possibly top THE MARTIAN but PROJECT HAIL MARY is at least as good and maybe better.

The novel employs a time-shifting strategy, with one set of scenes from the past chronicling the lead-up to the launch and the alternates taking place in the “present”, perhaps several decades from now.As with the MARTIAN, there are plenty of twists and turns, and unexpected reveals from start to finish. One of these quite unexpectedly adds a new layer to the plot reminiscent of a “buddy road trip movie”.  The writing is excellent.  The prose is filled with great science including some new physics and biology, and more than a bit of intentional humor. In parts it gets a little “mathy” (but it’s Weir after all) but the nearly 500 page novel flies by in no time.

However, readers’ reviews of this book were so enthusiastic and I really enjoyed the movie The Martian, so I started reading the sample and it quickly captured and held my interest. The book is a real page turner and I finished it in record time for me. It is just as much a novel of suspense as it is of science fiction. The work is very imaginative and it really puts the “science” in science fiction. The first person narrator faces one problem after another but overcomes all of them with human ingenuity, similar to the plot of The Martian. Thus the book is an optimistic paen to the saving power of reason. But, without being preachy, intrusive or contrived, the author also touches on how self sacrifice is necessary for the survival of our species, any species ... indeed, that evolution itself begets altruism. So why not 5 stars? Well this is not Asimov, Bradbury or Heinlein. It is light easy reading and more like a great burger than a fine steak. The dialogue is often fairly stilted. The narrator’s internal dialogues ( thoughts) often read like an over-excited teen-ager uttering gosh golly gee whiz hackneyed phrases. That can be endearing, but it can also be schlocky. Most of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes — the tough as nails female leader, the vodka swilling Russian, and so on. Those passages are real eye-rollers.

In fact, as of right now it’s my favorite book I’ve read this year. I honestly don’t think my review will do this book justice, but I will try my best.My suggestion is to go into this book as blind as possible. Try to avoid spoilers or reviews that give too much of the plot away if you can, because there are some fascinating developments that happen in this book that I am SO glad I didn’t know about until it was revealed to me as I read along. All I knew about this book going into it was the blurb, that it’s written by Andy Weir, and that some of the advanced readers were giving this book 5 stars but that was it. I didn’t read in depth on it beforehand, I just jumped right in and I am glad I did.Those of you who loved The Martian like me (it’s one of my favorite sci-fi books!) will love Project Hail Mary too, and I love both equally now. Project Hail Mary has a lot of similar elements to The Martian, yet it is still it’s own very unique story. Both books are science focused, take place in space, have some witty lines and writing, and revolve around a solitary astronaut/scientist, but from there onward the stories and concepts are very different.However, Project Hail Mary is just as expertly plotted and executed as The Martian with a main character you are rooting for from beginning to end. At times it is a wild ride and it is so compulsively readable. Project Hail Mary kept me up way past my bedtime two nights in a row because at times I just could NOT put this book down. There is a lot of cool exploration into a lot of different concepts and I actually learned quite a bit from reading this book.I thoroughly enjoyed how everything came together and the ending was SO SATISFYING! I’m not even going to talk about my favorite character because I don’t want to spoil anything, but let’s just say I appreciated that character so much (once you read the book you’ll know who I’m talking about).If I didn’t have a huge TBR stack staring at me, and if I hadn’t already promised to immediately lend my copy to my boyfriend, I would actually consider rereading this book again because I miss it already. Thankfully I had preordered my own copy so I can reread it again in the future once I've lent it out to people.Also I just found out that they’re going to turn this book into a movie. If it’s the same people who did the film version of The Martian then we’re going to be in for a treat because The Martian film is one of my favorite book to film adaptations. Let’s cross our fingers for an epic Project Hail Mary film.If you asked me whether or not I like the Martian or Project Hail Mary more, I would honestly respond that I enjoy both equally which makes me happy. It’s not often that I have two favorite books from the same author.Overall I recommend this to everyone!

I think what separates Project Hail Mary from Weir’s other novels is the mystery surrounding the problem that the character(s) seek to solve; it was a good mix of suspense and mystery compared to the other novels that relied on mainly suspense. My favorite aspect of Project Hail Mary was the relationship Ryland forms with Rocky, which can be hilarious at times.My only very minor issue with the novel is that it certainly relies a bit more on lots of chemistry (all very relevant, course) and some of the orbital mechanics that is used isn’t explained as well as the other scientific fields are in this novel or as well as orbital mechanics are explained in Weir’s other novels.All in all, I’d say it is Weir’s more adventurous literary endeavors (covering topics from language formation to civilization building to evolution to physics) and is certainly welcome, at least by me. I highly recommend it to any science fiction fan, plain science enthusiast, or anyone who was a fan of The Martian (maybe not Artemis).

Yes, it really is that good and deserves to be in that pantheon. This book really does have everything: apocalyptic excitement, physics, microbiology, space travel, very memorable characters, and plenty of fascinating sci-fi problems that need to be solved. The Martian was an exquisite book because of the plot and accuracy of the physics portrayed. Hail Mary does this too, but adds microbiology now as well. I'm fairly well-versed in both, and I found it all exciting and plausible. There is so much here, and also plot twists that keep the blood pressure up. I cried once or twice during the book, and that doesn't really happen to me. That's how attached you become to the characters. You will never forget them. I can't recommend this book enough.

Everything about it was exciting and it really lit the fire for me to read more often—not a thing I can say about many books.The only bad thing I can say is that there seems to be a lot of deus ex machina, where some problems which I thought would be a bigger deal sort of just get solved in a few pages.  This especially happens when the main character is suddenly able to remember convenient things at convenient times.  Or how, in the later parts, the main character is basically able to 3D print any object of the strongest material (un)known to man, in no time at all and with no effort.  It can just become a little unrealistic.

The movie was incredible in that they actually followed the book closer than 99% of other films based on books. It remains my favorite movie of the last 15 years or so as well. I don't know anyone (personally) that loves either of them as much as I do.With that said, I was REALLY looking forward to Artemis. It was good...but, it was certainly not in the same caliber as The Martian was (at least not for me). I enjoyed it a lot, however and appreciated how author Andy Weir chose to go in a completely different direction and not just rehash another similar story, which I am certain would have been great as well.As a result, I was cautious regarding Project Hail Mary. It sounded a little too close to The Martian, but yet, also different in that the circumstances simply could not be more opposite and the stakes so much higher. I'm trying to figure out the best way to summarize without giving too much away from this utterly compelling novel. As I read several reviews, I noticed a recurring theme: SCIENCE. Lots and LOTS of science. Holy cow, they were right. Many years ago I read Apollo 13 and Jim Lovell and his co-writer, try as they might, simply could not dumb down Orbital Mechanics anywhere near enough for me to have even a minor clue as to what they were attempting to say...I just skipped 90% of it and hoped that the sentences written afterwards, would help to make sense of what I had just skimmed over. I'm a lot of things, but a math wizard is definitely not one of them. Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) had an amazing talent for dumbing-down the science of what he was trying to explain in ways that genuinely made sense (most of the time). Not everyone has this talent, and I would say Andy Weir falls squarely in between. He's certainly better than Jim Lovell, but not quite as good as Crichton. But then again, outside of a science textbook, I haven't really read anything with quite as MUCH science as Project Hail Mary. So maybe he's just as good, but he just puts more science into his books than Crichton, maybe that's it...? Either way, be prepared for a lot of astonishingly interesting science within the pages of this novel...and I DO mean a LOT. I don't say this to make you wary or steer you away...on the contrary, Andy Weir has a special talent for making hard science truly entertaining.The book opens with an absolutely amazing and frightening premise: an astronaut awakes from an induced coma to find the only other two people on board have died at some point along their journey...but it gets worse. He has no idea who he is, or why he's on the ship, and oh yeah, they look to be a long way from home. A really, REALLY long way from home. In fact, the sun he sees isn't actually OUR sun at all. He's managed to leave our solar system entirely. And he has no idea why.((Minor Spoilers)) The book goes through some clever flash-backs, which set the stage for why the mission happens, and slowly, carefully explains how they managed to get so far away from earth in such a short amount of time. Basically, earth's sun seems to be dying. At the rate of decay, we have maybe 19 years left before the gradual cooling has catastrophic consequences resulting in the death of billions (best guess). Why the sun is dimming is quite the conundrum in the first place. Turns out it really isn't dying, it's being killed by an outside source...which turns out to be easily the greatest find in history. It's alien life, and they are using the sun for food, essentially. It's alien life, but not intelligent life. But still, wow! ALIENS, right???After this monumental discovery, and some tremendous research done by the most improbable scientist, the investigation into what is happening and why and what to do about it expands exponentially to other nations in order to pool all the resources possible to hopefully save the sun, and by extension, the human race as well. They learn. A LOT. A plan is put together, and with the help of the newly discovered microscopic alien life, which can also double as a power source (along with a few other nifty surprises), they begin to create one last, Hail Mary that could very well be the last chance we might have to save earth. It's audacious. It's dangerous, and it is absolutely critical that it succeed.As our astronaut's memory slowly unravels, so does his identity: Ryland Grace. He's a teacher on earth. Just a science teacher. Not even a college professor. He's amazingly smart, though. But he's no astronaut...and certainly not one who would volunteer to go on a one-way mission to another solar system to ""try"" and save humanity. Yet here he is. Alone. light years from earth, trying to solve the biggest riddle in all of human history. Ryland accepts his situation, such as it is, with relative indifference (for the most part). It doesn't matter HOW he got here. He's here now and he may as well use that time to be as productive as possible, right? Along the way, he unravels even more information regarding the microscopic alien life which is slowly dimming our sun during some additional flashbacks. The aliens, dubbed, ""Astrophage"" are quite the galactic plague as it turns out. Stars all over the galaxy are also losing their light, all due to the little buggers. All that is, except one particular star named, Tau Ceti. Now why would that one star be unaffected by Astrophage, when every single star around it has been affected to some degree. The plan is to go there and figure it out and send the information back, hopefully in time to save the sun before the damage to earth is beyond repair.There is an incredible amount of stuff going on. The story switches from Tau Ceti to flashbacks of how the whole mission was planned and implemented (which is VERY entertaining, especially Director Stratt, who may actually be my favorite character in the entire novel). Weir is becoming quite adept at building tension, and abruptly switching the story from Tau Ceti back to earth and building more of the backstory then switching back to Tau Ceti. Keeping it all in check and most importantly, interesting all while mixing in a healthy dose of science, which I am to understand is pretty much all genuine, is quite the juggling act. I have long known science can be astronomically entertaining (see what I did there?) when done right...but unfortunately very few people in a position to teach science actually know the best way to create that interest in others. I can say without reservation, Andy Weir definitely knows how to do it...at least in written form.There is so much I want to say more regarding this truly phenomenal story, but I simply cannot without ruining a lot of the fun and surprises revealed along the way...and it is killing me to keep it locked in. Though I labeled a spoiler warning earlier, I don't think it gave away any more than what the author himself has revealed in interviews he has done regarding the book, and what you can glean from reading the summary here and just a couple other reviews. Tying all of that science together is truly astonishing to me. The creativity to put it into a novel that is remarkably exciting to read is nothing more than incredible talent. Kudo's to Andy Weir for not just hitting a home run, Project Hail Mary is a Grand Slam all the way. I truly did not want this story to end. By the way, I enjoyed the ending quite a bit. I don't know if everyone will. But it was fine for me. I think the ending screams ""sequel"" at some point too. A lot was left open-ended (IMO) and I wouldn't mind reading a follow-up to this. It doesn't HAVE to happen, but there are a lot of ways where the story could go if Andy chose to do it. Just sayin'.Just run out and buy this book.","Astonishing, Fun, Entertaining, Fantastic",Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful,10670,1776,10803870,Public

In other words, lightning DOES strike the same place twice.But you don't need to search the web for this information.  If you want proof that lightning strikes twice, just read Andy Weir's newest book, Project Hail Mary, and you'll see that Weir has created a giant sci-fi bestseller, in the same electric path as The Martian.Ryland Grace has a puzzle on his hands.  He wakes up without a clue as to where he is, but he seems to be alone except for a computer AI that was keeping him alive. Unfortunately it didn't seem to be doing the same for two others in his ... wherever he is ... as he notes the decayed corpses in their creches on the ... well, it's a ship.  A space ship. And bit by bit Grace puts the pieces of the puzzle together.An alien microbe has been discovered. Ryland Grace is brought on to the science team to learn more about the life form because Grace, currently a middle school science teacher, wrote papers about the notation that there does not need to be water to create life.  Only in a biozone such as Earth's would water be needed, but other building blocks could be used in other systems.The science community as a whole mocked Grace, which is why he left and went on to teach kids, but now, he may be the best suited to understand this new life form. And as he remembers more and more, he also remembers that this life form is feeding on the energy output of the sun, which is decreasing the energy that gets to Earth, which spells disaster - as in the end of all life as currently known - on Earth if something isn't done.Scientists discover that Sol isn't the only star that is losing its energy output - likely due to the alien consumption, but that there is one star, in the center of all the known stars losing their energy, that remains constant with its output.  In which case, the answer to the survival for Earth is likely found there, at Tau Ceti.The world's best scientific minds come together (by force and coercion) to create a ship that can get to Tau Ceti in twelve years (using the alien microbe as fuel) with shuttle pods to bring back answers to how to save the planet, but for the crew, it's a one-way trip.Knowing why he's there is only the first puzzle for Grace.  Now he has to figure out how to save Earth.  There's a very small window of time for him to discover the way to save the human race and get the answers sent back.  Take too long and the shuttles will return to a dead planet.This book is amazing.Author Andy Weir brings us back to the magic that made The Martian so successful - an abandoned scientist trying to survive.  But Ryland Grace's story is more complicated because he's not just trying to survive, but also help humanity survive.There's lots and lots of science - which is part of Weir's writing signature - and there's also a really wonderful story.It's hard for me to tell you just what I liked about this book because anything I write will be a spoiler and a huge part of the joy in this book is making the discoveries with Ryland Grace.Grace is our main character, but through the liberal use of flashbacks, we have a full cast of characters - at least one quite important to the story. Everyone is unique and individual which makes it easy to read, but just as with The Martian, where Mark Watney's personality carries the story, Ryland Grace here is the smart-mouth, sometimes funny, obsessed scientist infusing his personal tastes into his discoveries. He's also quite smart - which is good since he will need his intellect to save all of humanity.This is a page-turner. I did not want to put this book down. Neither did my 21 year old son who picked up my copy after I was well into it and finished it before I did. And days later he's still talking about how much he liked it and quoting sections of it to me at the dinner table.I hope Ballantine Books will do a very large print run because this is going to be huge seller and you definitely don't want to miss out on the biggest thing to come out in 2021.Looking for a good book?

The best way I can describe it is that Andy Weir watched the film adaptation of his own first book and thought ""Wow! I should write a book like that!""As many other reviewers have mentioned, this book has a lot of the same building blocks that made The Martian so much fun: lone astronaut incredibly far from Earth, detailed scientific problem-solving, and light, cheesy humor.  It's a nice blend.  Weir also does a great job of writing the crisis moments as page-turners where the book is hard to put down.That being said, the book isn't perfect.  I would rank it a fairly distant second to The Martian but ahead of Artemis.  Without going into spoilers, the setting for the book overall feels significantly more contrived than in either of Weir's previous books.  It was fairly easy to imagine Mark Watney on Mars in 10-20 years, so everything in The Martian felt very realistic and grounded.  Here, not so much.  The main character in Project Hail Mary also feels generally less likeable and less human than Watney did.  There were chunks of the book where I genuinely did not care whether the mission succeeded - I just was not as invested as I was in Mark Watney getting home from Mars.All in all, this book is worth a read if you like Andy Weir's other work.

If you are going to use antimatter as a power source you have at least three challenges: 1)Where do you get the antimatter; 2)How do you store it; 3)How do you use it?  Two out of three are explained by obviously incorrect mechanisms and the third is pretty implausible. 1)Antineutrino/Neutrino production supposedly occurs via pair production in thermal proton collisions.  I suppose this channel is conceivable, but it would proceed via a vitual Z boson, which is a neutral particle about 90 times the mass of the proton that interacts only weakly.  ""Weakly"" is the key word here.  The crosssection for such an interaction would be fantastically tiny.  I don't know whether it would take the age of the universe to observe production of a singly such pair, but I suspect it would be something like that.  2)Storing the neutrinos is supposedly accomplished via a miraculous cell membrane opaque to neutrinos.  The miracle is how such a membrane would be evolved, since there is no substance in the known universe that would give the cell the slightest start in this direction. 3)This is the worst -- the neutrinos and antineutrinos supposedly annihilate into photons. I guess the author thought this was likely since charged antiparticles like positrons annihilate into photons.  This is because they are charged.  Neutral neutrinos do not couple at all to photons. Period. Full stop. I don't really know what a confined bunch of thermal energy neutrinos would do, but I think probably nothing since the only decays available via the weak coupling are into products far more massive than the available energies. I'm not positive about that, but one thing for sure -- they are not going to annihilate into photons.There were other lapses of scientific plausibility, such as a casual disregard for momentum conservation when the super-cells blast out photons, for some reason in only one direction, and then left passively on the plate to be scraped off by a mechanical arm. And a few other, but the particle physics impossibilities are by far the worst.As an adventure story it's reasonably well written, although it goes on far too long with one crisis after another being solved by combining human and alien technology.

Mr. Weir explains his protagonist's predicaments and solutions sufficiently to the ""uneducated.""  That said, if you do have a strong science background, you will appreciate even more the depth of the author's knowledge of science in general.

It makes it feel more real. Andy Weir explained a lot of the concepts. Some just went over my head and others, surprisingly, made sense. Surprisingly, because I was never great in science classes.The story itself is phenomenal. The main storyline and the flashbacks (or the moments in which Ryland gets his memory back) are well spaced out. None feel too overpowering. Every character was explained so well that I could easily imagine them and why they made the decisions they did. His entire journey is just... I'm not sure I have the right words... unbelievable. I couldn't put the book and just had to know how his story evolves. There were moments where I just sad there crying or where I was overly excited and happy because I could feel exactly what he was going through.

I also had issues with some of the humor - it seemed hokey/jokey, esp. when naming planets/natural phenomenon, or naming devices.But the main con was the over-over explanations of the science, which made me feel like I was reading a textbook at times or listening to someone really really dull over explain; this needed serious editing, because it really talked down to the reader, and, not only that, but much of the knowledge was broad, but not deep.So this was more like mind candy and not really a deep read.",Too much explaining,Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,224,37,789101,Public

Watney’s an engineer, and every problem presents itself as an engineering challenge. Now Weir has come out with a new novel, Project Hail Mary, and it’s much the same. A biologist-turned-middle-school-teacher named Ryland Grace is alone light-years from Earth on a suicide mission to save the human species. But his first job is to save himself. And the challenges he faces demand solutions that only clever engineering and a knowledge of science can solve.This book has a lot going for it. It’s suspenseful. Even hard to put town at times. Laugh-out-loud funny on occasion. Weir takes great care to base events on known physical, chemical, and biological properties. And the portrayal of alien life-forms is intriguing and seems plausible. But in the end it’s science fiction only an engineer could love. Again and again, for page after tedious page, Ryland Grace tackles engineering problems to address a succession of threats and emergencies that come out of the woodwork (as it were). Grace—or, rather, Andy Weir—is devilishly clever, but it gets old fast.Here’s what happensRyland Grace is happily enjoying the adulation of his middle-school science students. Years earlier, a paper he had written as a rising young biologist challenged the accepted wisdom that all life requires water. The reaction among exobiologists was fast and furious, and Grace was driven from his research position at a university. Now, that same paper has forced him back into the public eye. A microscopic alien life-form called “Astrophage” is gobbling up the sun’s energy, and Grace has come to the attention of the extraordinary woman leading the international to save humanity from it. That effort is a Moon Shot to the power of ten or a hundred, and Eva Stratt commands all the Earth’s resources to address the threat. Including Ryland Grace, whether he likes it or not.In case you haven’t guessed, Andy Weir is a lot stronger on science and engineering than he is on international politics. The friendly global effort he posits is preposterous. It’s inconceivable to me that an existential threat, no matter how imminent, would induce the Americans, the Chinese, and the Russians to band together in a united effort engaging all their military and economic resources. Not going to happen.Not to belabor the tale, Grace assists Stratt in a breakneck campaign to construct an interstellar spaceship and train the crew of three selected to take it to the Tau Ceti system. There, Earth scientists have concluded, lies the origin of the Astrophage. Then a whole sequence of things go wrong, and Grace himself ends up on the starship Hail Mary—alone. Because his two crewmates have died en route. And to make matters worse, he wakes from a coma with amnesia. It takes him a long, long time to figure out where he is and what happened to take him there. The upshot is, Ryland Grace is “all that stands between humanity and extinction.” And then the really big surprises start coming. . .About the authorComputer programmer Andy Weir (1972-) self-published The Martian in 2011 and created such a stir that Crown Publishing Group picked it up and turned it into a bestseller. The book is often cited as one of the best science fiction novels of recent years. He grew up in Milpitas, California, and attended (but did not graduate from) the University of California, San Diego. He has written four novels and a slew of short stories, comics, graphic novels, and other materials.","Devilishly clever, but it gets old fast",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,12455,1497,7901013,Public

His second novel, Artemis, was not quite as revered. Although I personally loved it, it had a lot of similarities as The Martian. The main character just seemed to be a gender bent version of Mark.Project Hail Mary is different, and is my favorite Andy Weir book to date. Firstly, I must say there is not a single swear word in the entire book. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it was disappointing, but it was an obvious choice.The first part of the novel may be a bit slow. You are disjointed and have no idea what is going on, because the main character, Ryland, is disjointed and has no idea of what is going on. He has lost his memory and he seems to be alone in space.The novel is a combination of real time events as well as memory flash backs. It makes for a very thrilling narrative. Then pops in my favorite character ever of any book - Rocky. I won’t tell you much about him because it would spoil everything. But I love him. I will buy action figures of him. . .

The main reason I'm writing this now is because I know there were some readers turned off by excessive cursing in The Martian as well as Artemis.

He must travel to a distant star to find the reason that that star is not being eaten alive by a single-celled organism that is eating the earth.What differentiates this book from The Martian is the relationship that develops between Grace and Rocky. . .a hard-shelled -- arthropod (?) -- from an alien world who is at the distant star making an effort to solve the same problem for ITS home world.There is a sequence (again, a similarity to the Martian) where they must learn to communicate. Even though Rocky is not anthropomorphic, you develop a sense of its personality and the norms of its race.We learn that Rocky's entire crew has died during the journey to the star, and furthermore that one of the practices of its race is to watch each other sleep. When Rocky asks Grace to watch it sleep, it's emotional and heartbreaking and the entire relationship between the two characters grows and strengthens from there.Watching their friendship develop while their scientific skill sets mesh together to solve problem gives the book a weight that the Martian just didn't have and I don't think many sci-fi authors are capable of pulling off.  That this came from an author who so far has shown more willingness to write about chemical reactions than interpersonal interactions is especially enheartening.The last chapter was just. So. Perfect. Right down the last paragraph.Just so well done. One of my favorite books I've read in so long.",Superb. Flavors of the Martian but so much better.

I usually borrow books from our local library or use Prime Reading .  I also haunt thrift stores and  our used book stores.  I was really looking forward to reading Andy Weir's new book and after reading the reviews I just could not wait and I  purchased it.  Yes, I paid retail for this book!  And I'm glad I did not wait for my library hold to become available.Ryland Grace is a surprising character.  We learn more about him as he is remembering his past.  I thought his amnesia was going to be a gimmick, but Andy Weir skillfully uses it to measure out information about Ryland Grace.  Discovering what happened and why he is on this mission along side following his progress on the Hail Mary kept me reading and ignoring everything else.  Eeverytime my husband came over to talk to me I told him I was reading Andy Weir's new book and the sooner I finished, the sooner he could read it.Without giving away the unexpected happenings in the book, it is hard to explain how much fun it is when  just as I think I have the next bit figured out, boom, wow, thing explode in new directions.  So many times in other books the author drops too many or to obvious hints and I'm not surprised at what happens.  Andy Weir keeps veering around in ways I did not see coming.I love science fiction, but so much gets lumped in with fantasy that finding hard science novels is hard.  I enjoyed the science in Project Hail Mary and the way that it is explained so I can follow along without getting bogged down and having to reread the explanations.  It is fun be reminded of how much science I used to know without having to use Bing to find answers.Yeah, spend the money and head off on an adventure you'll never forget.

This is a well-written story about a quest to save Earth as well as a planet in a neighboring galaxy, both of which are endangered by the same threat.  Author Andy Weir has come up with a plausible scenario that only a fertile and imaginative mind could conjur without sounding ridiculous.His newest novel is crammed with science and ingenuity, taking the reader on an intestellar journey that could easily have been over written and turned into a pure math and science tome.  But Mr. Weir avoids this while still periodically challenging your memories of science and math probably left far behind in your high school years.  And that is a good thing because this could have ended up being a very dry novel.The author extolls the virtue of hard work and the ethical tests of 'never giving up'.  He does so in a good way, adding subtle humor and sarcasm as needed to lighten the mood during unexpected (and serious) challenges, and all the while allowing his characters to learn more about themselves and their true capabilities.  The old addage of ""what man can think of man can create"" comes to play here.This is the story of the human spirit rising to the challenge facing all of mankind by using imperfect people to  conquer devestating situations.  It is a true story of hope against all odds.  And it's well worth your reading.","No Sex, Violence Or Rock & Roll",Verified Purchase,,15435,1719,10031292,Public

The creativity in this story is exceptional. It is hard to find new ideas in SF that don’t come across as re-dos of old ideas. A lot of science-related research was clearly done in the development of the story. I am a fan of hard science fiction and this is a prime example of it. Bravo!!From a literary standpoint, this is a dual-timeline novel. The main story line forms one timeline, with the secondary timeline consisting mostly of backstory. Further, the first-person protagonist is the main character in both timelines. A challenge with this approach is that the author builds up suspense in the main timeline and then pulls us over to the secondary timeline where there is often little or no suspense. The suspense vanishes, only to return later on. A possible solution to this would have been to suppress details in the secondary timeline. This would have shortened the book, which I think would be a good idea. I read the Kindle version and, when I thought it a bit long, I checked the length of the hardcopy book: 496 pages. In my opinion at least 100 pages could be removed from the hardcopy. In general, detail is included in a novel to make it appear more believable. Detail in the backstory could have been brushed over.There is a hint of the “Hero’s Journey” storyline in this story. It has a twist that didn’t set well with me.

Project Hail Mary is not The Martian Redux, nor is it another telling of Artemis. It starts with a mystery that wrapped inside another mystery, and then it becomes a story of friendship and courage that takes an unexpected turn.The Sun's output has mysteriously diminished, threatening Earth's ecosphere as a whole. In Michael Crichton-like fashion, our hero comes to the problem because of some tangentially related research he'd done in the past, research that made him a pariah who escapes to teaching middle-school science. It's something he's quite good at, and it makes him an unlikely hero in our save-the-world story. He's still his own man, and throughout his saga, he stays true to himself.  There's no magical transition from ordinary man to superhero, and that makes him all the more realistic.Some might quibble with the plot-science used in the book, but at the same time, it is a novel that doesn't need to beg for suspension of disbelief. The devices Weir uses are believable enough, and if he got this or that a little wrong, so what -- it's not glaring enough to be irritating.Bottom line, as the onion of a story gets peeled, there are times it will make you want to cry for the characters, make you cheer for them and make you want them to succeed.

What a ride! I didn’t think Weir could possibly top THE MARTIAN but PROJECT HAIL MARY is at least as good and maybe better. It’s got a great plot that starts out seeming somewhat familiar (i.e., last ditch attempt by a united Earth to quickly send up an experimental interstellar space ship to try to fix a “the end of the world as we know it” scenario) but rapidly diverges into something totally original.  The novel employs a time-shifting strategy, with one set of scenes from the past chronicling the lead-up to the launch and the alternates taking place in the “present”, perhaps several decades from now.As with the MARTIAN, there are plenty of twists and turns, and unexpected reveals from start to finish. One of these quite unexpectedly adds a new layer to the plot reminiscent of a “buddy road trip movie”.  The writing is excellent.  The prose is filled with great science including some new physics and biology, and more than a bit of intentional humor. In parts it gets a little “mathy” (but it’s Weir after all) but the nearly 500 page novel flies by in no time.

The author takes more scientific liberties this time around with miracle materials that shouldn't exist and improbable interstellar microbes that have features only present in earth life. However these do not detract from the compelling narrative playing out on the pages. The author has previously demonstrated willingness to bend scientific fact for storytelling and I wholeheartedly agree as I would much rather read a compelling story with some scientific inaccuracies rather than a boring one that was completely correct scientifically.5/5 stars,Compelling and near believable narrative,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,20,12,83723545,Public

However, readers’ reviews of this book were so enthusiastic and I really enjoyed the movie The Martian, so I started reading the sample and it quickly captured and held my interest. The book is a real page turner and I finished it in record time for me. It is just as much a novel of suspense as it is of science fiction. The work is very imaginative and it really puts the “science” in science fiction. The first person narrator faces one problem after another but overcomes all of them with human ingenuity, similar to the plot of The Martian. Thus the book is an optimistic paen to the saving power of reason. But, without being preachy, intrusive or contrived, the author also touches on how self sacrifice is necessary for the survival of our species, any species ... indeed, that evolution itself begets altruism. So why not 5 stars? Well this is not Asimov, Bradbury or Heinlein. It is light easy reading and more like a great burger than a fine steak. The dialogue is often fairly stilted. The narrator’s internal dialogues ( thoughts) often read like an over-excited teen-ager uttering gosh golly gee whiz hackneyed phrases. That can be endearing, but it can also be schlocky. Most of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes — the tough as nails female leader, the vodka swilling Russian, and so on. Those passages are real eye-rollers.

In fact, as of right now it’s my favorite book I’ve read this year. I honestly don’t think my review will do this book justice, but I will try my best.My suggestion is to go into this book as blind as possible. Try to avoid spoilers or reviews that give too much of the plot away if you can, because there are some fascinating developments that happen in this book that I am SO glad I didn’t know about until it was revealed to me as I read along. All I knew about this book going into it was the blurb, that it’s written by Andy Weir, and that some of the advanced readers were giving this book 5 stars but that was it. I didn’t read in depth on it beforehand, I just jumped right in and I am glad I did.Those of you who loved The Martian like me (it’s one of my favorite sci-fi books!) will love Project Hail Mary too, and I love both equally now. Project Hail Mary has a lot of similar elements to The Martian, yet it is still it’s own very unique story. Both books are science focused, take place in space, have some witty lines and writing, and revolve around a solitary astronaut/scientist, but from there onward the stories and concepts are very different.However, Project Hail Mary is just as expertly plotted and executed as The Martian with a main character you are rooting for from beginning to end. At times it is a wild ride and it is so compulsively readable. Project Hail Mary kept me up way past my bedtime two nights in a row because at times I just could NOT put this book down. There is a lot of cool exploration into a lot of different concepts and I actually learned quite a bit from reading this book.I thoroughly enjoyed how everything came together and the ending was SO SATISFYING! I’m not even going to talk about my favorite character because I don’t want to spoil anything, but let’s just say I appreciated that character so much (once you read the book you’ll know who I’m talking about).If I didn’t have a huge TBR stack staring at me, and if I hadn’t already promised to immediately lend my copy to my boyfriend, I would actually consider rereading this book again because I miss it already. Thankfully I had preordered my own copy so I can reread it again in the future once I've lent it out to people.Also I just found out that they’re going to turn this book into a movie. If it’s the same people who did the film version of The Martian then we’re going to be in for a treat because The Martian film is one of my favorite book to film adaptations. Let’s cross our fingers for an epic Project Hail Mary film.If you asked me whether or not I like the Martian or Project Hail Mary more, I would honestly respond that I enjoy both equally which makes me happy. It’s not often that I have two favorite books from the same author.Overall I recommend this to everyone!

I think what separates Project Hail Mary from Weir’s other novels is the mystery surrounding the problem that the character(s) seek to solve; it was a good mix of suspense and mystery compared to the other novels that relied on mainly suspense. My favorite aspect of Project Hail Mary was the relationship Ryland forms with Rocky, which can be hilarious at times.My only very minor issue with the novel is that it certainly relies a bit more on lots of chemistry (all very relevant, course) and some of the orbital mechanics that is used isn’t explained as well as the other scientific fields are in this novel or as well as orbital mechanics are explained in Weir’s other novels.All in all, I’d say it is Weir’s more adventurous literary endeavors (covering topics from language formation to civilization building to evolution to physics) and is certainly welcome, at least by me. I highly recommend it to any science fiction fan, plain science enthusiast, or anyone who was a fan of The Martian (maybe not Artemis).

The Martian was an exquisite book because of the plot and accuracy of the physics portrayed. Hail Mary does this too, but adds microbiology now as well. I'm fairly well-versed in both, and I found it all exciting and plausible. There is so much here, and also plot twists that keep the blood pressure up.

This is the best sci fi book I’ve read in a long time, since Stephenson’s Seveneves, since Weir’s first book, The Martian.Weir’s second book was enjoyable, but kinda forgettable.This one is a blast, just like The Martian: lots of science and science problems to work out (may be a little tedious  though for non-science people, but then why would they be reading sci fi in the first place?).Great use of flashbacks and a severely interesting premise, then add to that a surprise friend.The ending might be hokey, but satisfies in a classic sci fi way. And you can see a movie definitely coming pretty quick.The content reminded me in general of Arthur C. Clarke.A good, comfortable sci fi romp.",Great Classic Sci Fi !,Verified Purchase,,195,7,21890922,Public
