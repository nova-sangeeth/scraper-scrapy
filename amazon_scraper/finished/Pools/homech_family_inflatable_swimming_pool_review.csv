Some things to note:(Update: putting it in the grass caused mildew on the bottom of the pool and it smells horrible! Keep it on a deck or some ventilated surface to keep this from happening!)1. We put thick landscaping fabric under it to protect from nail heads on the deck to avoid rips (update: the mildew came back when we did this, guess we will have to risk the nail heads!)2. Got a cover for it from Intex to keep rainwater/leaves/bugs from getting in (rain makes it cloudy)3. Got some liquid chlorine from a local pool store (they told us how much to use) and pool test strips to make sure there’s enough/not too much chlorine to keep the water safe and from getting slimy...which happened a few days after having water in it before we covered it and started using chlorine.4. Got a pool net to get the leaves/grass/bugs out after kids swim in it5.

We had three months of use and would wish I had bought it two months sooner. Just deflated it and put away just over a month ago. During the covid summer, this pool was a huge plus to have. I really wish I had bought it sooner than I did. It set up easy. We put a tarp with yoga mats under it on our cement patio, tarp down first, then the matts. They really were very cushy for sitting on when in the pool. We don't have kids, but it certainly would of made a softer landing for anyone slipping. The first photo shows it dry, and that is a large golden retriever behind it. It is not deep enough for the dog or adults to swim in, but young children would be able to splash about. Four adults can sit quite comfortably in the pool, resting agains the corners. One man about six feet, the other 5.8, us gals 5.5 and we had plenty room to spare. The second photo is filled, takes about 300 gallons of water. I recommend getting the chorine tablets and the holder that floats to extend time between clean out. (I removed the holder in the morning before we would use that day, as it did get strong in that small of space) Also buy some water test strips. I was able to go a month before a complete drain and clean, though I would drain about a third of the water around two weeks, refill with some fresh. I bought a sump pump so we could water the garden with the water we drained. Third photo shows the other tarp we bought to cover it, we used bungee cords to attach to bottom tarp. Forth is just showing the size of pool and the tiny box it came in! Along with our average size Labs, for a visual reference. Fifth is of a floating wine glass, plastic. Worked great btw. Fifth and sixth are the inflatable pool short length chairs. Neat bonus, face them towards each other and one person can use as a lounge.

They are providing a new pool that we can continue to enjoy this hot summer.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  So out of the box it felt heavy, which is good for an inflatable pool. Inflating is alright with a pump, but the valve opening is a little small for my pump so I've got to press and hold it rather than just stick the head of the pump in.It held up pretty good for first couple times. At this point I've had it for 11 days and it's been inflated and filled 5 or 6 different times (need to move it so grass doesn't die). It's now developed some kind of slow leak in the bottom third to where I need to try and inflate it every 4 or 5 hours otherwise the pool lists to one side and water runs out. But because it's the bottom, the pressure from the water makes it near impossible to reinflate without draining.It seems every inflatable pool has this issue after some amount of time, no matter what I do to try and prevent it. So it felt more durable out of the box, but isn't proving to be so.","Nice out of the box, has some flaws, great customer service",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,,,,1971439,85,69,Public

The pool arrived about a week early just in time for the 100 degree heat we were expecting!!! We have a tiny patio so it fits snug but is wonderful!!!! The only hard part was blowing it up. I used the battery operated pump I use for our inflatable air bed that we have for company. The pump works great it’s the 3 holes on the pool that are super hard to open and close. I still haven’t mastered filling it up with air without losing a lot of the air I’ve just put in the pool due to the complexity of trying to close the air plugs. So my only warning would be to buy lots of batteries if using a battery pump to inflate it. I did try my manual raft pump as well but that was even worse. Otherwise I highly recommend this pool.

The pool cover makes all the difference, so the pool water doesn't overflow during rain storms, dilute the chlorine treated pool water, it limits floating debris, leaves, bugs, etc. We chose to setup the pool on top of a tarp to add protection to the bottom of the pool. We left the tarp larger on all sides than the dimensions of the pool so that we can easily fold or gather in the sides when mowing the lawn which allows for the lawn to be mowed uniformly and prevent wet grass splatter sticking to the sides of the pool. This was a great purchase. We plan to set it up next year even if we join the community pool, so we always have access to a pool when we want it. Highly recommend!!!!!

Even a bike pump will take a lot of time and effort. You can get the electric ones cheap, and you will never question the wisdom of the purchase.Storage: Not too difficult, just be sure to clean it and let it dry before laying it flat and rolling so that extra air can escape before you fold and store it.If  you have ever camped before, you are already familiar with the folding and rolling actions to store your gear.We put ours in an old suitcase for the off-season, being concerned that a family of mice may want to enjoy the pool too, since we store it in our shed.So... would I recommend this pool?YESYESYES!!!",What a great time with my grandson!,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,,,912390,91,53,Public

Then, 3 micro-tears developed on the top of the pool, for no apparent reason. I was able to patch them using AirSeal and Bestway vinyl patches. I did contact the company my email, because the pool has a short warranty period. I was refunded $30 by Homech, (the real price of the pool!) and they offered me extra patches. The joy I get from the pool is immense, but it does seem a bit more fragile at the seams than I expected. No kids or pets are swimming, just one 100 pound adult. I keep the pool chlorinated, vacuumed, and covered when not in use. I take good care of it. The company did respond promptly to my email, and refunded some of my money. The pool is a little expensive; I feel all of these blow-up pool prices are ""inflated"" at the moment. These are $30 kiddie pools at places like Target and Walmart, which are selling now for $130 online, because big box stores are sold out. So, bearing that in mind, it's still been sheer heaven to swim in this pool during the hot, quarantine summer. I'd give 5 stars if it were just a little more durable.

I got the 120"" version, and it is bigger than I expected, which is GREAT! I was really worried that I was going to find it was not big enough to really spread out, but I was wrong. My husband (6') can lie crosswise (narrowest point) from head to toe without going over the side. It is perfect for 2 adults to lounge or float in. The sides are the perfect height to rest your arms on (my energetic dachshund can even get in and out on her own). I would suggest that you only try to relax against the corners, as the sides (at least for an adult) will squash down if you try this. For perspective, last summer we purchased on of those round, 10"" Intex pools (with the inflatable ring). While it was super deep, it really wasn't big enough (diameter) to use that depth for any real purpose other than to float, and the pool itself was a major pain to deal with. It collected algae even with the utmost care and chlorine application, and killed the grass underneath it. THIS pool is easy enough to handle that you can tear it down periodically to avoid algae build up, don't have to deal with chemicals so you can drain it right into the grass, and move it to different spots to avoid grass damage. It also gives you the same ability to float or sit, which is what we only really did in the other pool anyway.Inflating: I purchased an inexpensive hand held Intex pump that worked great, but I also 'lightly' inflated because I was worried that if I overinflated, it would blow a seam once the heat started up in the middle of the day. This meant that one side sort of 'slouched', so keep an eye on when and how you inflate to avoid this.Fill level: This feels like a really deep baja shelf, which I love.Durability: here's an anecdote... my Doxie tried digging into it while I was filling, but got bored because it didn't react at all (no tears or anything)Size: pretty much perfect. While I would LOVE a real pool to dive around in and be more active, that isn't an option (renting). I would posit that unless you get a semi-permanent $$$$ above ground pool, you will probably still not get that with anything else out there (outside of an 'in-ground' pool anyway). This makes me 'feel' like I'm at a resort (BYO drinks and music), and I only miss the actual swimming part. At least I am cool and outside in the sunshine (and I can bring my dog!) - See pictures for scale. These were taken right after I started filling, so the water is only a few inches deep.Draining: Drain plugs are understandably difficult to open (as it should be). Practice before you put water in so you know what you are getting into.Best of all worlds for maintenance, comfort, and having access to a pool.PS: sorry the pictures are sideways... they are not sideways on my computer, and I can't figure out how to rotate them here (there doesn't seem to be an option to fix).",Portable Baja Shelf,Verified Purchase,59 people found this helpful,,,,294441,255,40,Public

I suspect the valves unless there are pinholes that were there when it was shipped.  Otherwise it seems fairly sturdy. I'll keep it and keep reinflating it because it's 90°+ and an imperfect pool is better than none.If you buy this pool you'll need an air pump and a tarp to cover it.

Because it's rather large dumping the water every night will turn the surrounding ground into a swamp. So consider treatment as with a larger pool.

I found the best spot to place the pool, filled the pool to the 2nd rib and left it for a day, the next day the pool was sagging as you can see in the picture.  I don't think it is damage to pool. I will know more after we refill the pool next week after moving the location of the pool a bit to see if the sagging will continue in a new location. Overall my 9 year old is in love with this and I can't lie I enjoyed sitting in the pool after putting up a pop-up canopy in the hot sun!",First inflatable Pool,Verified Purchase,,,,,3419794,25,35,Public

The pool does become a bit misshapen when filled with water. Ours is more hourglass-shaped than triangular, and we had to drain and move it three times because the ground beneath it wasn't *perfectly* level, which caused even more misshapenness. (The ground looked level, but apparently it wasn't.) The sizing is a few inches smaller though than described...there's no way a whole family (parents and more than two kids) could comfortably fit in the pool. I like that there are three inflatable chambers--much sturdier that way. Ours did not come with any instructions or a pump, but luckily setup was pretty intuitive and I had a pump from an old air bed that I was able to use.

My kids are younger (5 and 7) so they still had a lot of fun in it. Adults can only sit on the pool.  The first time I used it, the air leaked out of the top level over the course of a few days, but it might be because I didn't close the valve tightly enough or because my kids were leaning on the top level.  It isn't too difficult to add more air before you go in for the day.I had read some reviews that said it is difficult to drain the water from the pool. I agree. The plastic seal kept closing when I was trying to drain the water.  I had to hold up the bottom of the pool to allow the water to drain.  This was extremely difficult because the pool was so heavy with the water in it. You have to deflate the air from the pool to effectively drain the pool.  Once you deflate the air, it drains very quickly and easily.  I suggest deflating it one level at a time otherwise the water gushes out and floods rather than soaking slowly into your grass.Overall, it is a great pool, but if they change the design of the drains (so that there are more drain holes or perhaps one on each side of the pool) it would be perfect.

I thought I had hit the drain, so I tried again and the water came out.  There was a very tiny hole in the seam.  The enclosed patch did not hold even 6 hours.  Bought patches for a pool fro.

The inflatable chamber will not loose air after removing the air pump which is nice that you’re not having to rush to plug it before the air escapes. There are two drain values to easy drainage. The pool comes with a repair kit. My son has already poked a hole in the top layer with his dinosaur. (He was throwing it in the pool and it’s a solid, hard Dino toy, so I don’t blame the pool, but just FYI to be careful). The pool is big enough for his to splash in and float. Can’t really learn how to “swim” in this pool. I would recommend a cover to keep out grass, bugs and leaves between uses.

I have 4 that are 4-9 yrs old that like to get in the pool. Was big enough for them to splash and play around in. We wanted something big 8 enough for my husband (he's over 6ft) to fit in as well. We've only used it once and he didn't get in but I'm sure when with him in the kids would still have plenty of room to play. It was easy to inflate with a pump we purchased separately and easy to drain after finishing - my husband just opened the plug. So far it's been sturdy, my kids were leaving and bouncing all over the edges and there were no issues. When full of water the sides bowed out a little but didn't affect anything. It stayed inflated with no problem.",Good sized and sturdy pool,Verified Purchase,,,,,1963754,15,16,Public

Not to say it's worse than the next product - I think all of these inflatable pools are overpriced.On the upside, the material is definitely some kind of upgraded plastic. It has a somewhat fabric texture. It's heavy enough to have some confidence in. It's easy to roll/unroll, and inflate. It's long enough for a grown adult to lay down, but (as a kiddie pool) it's not intended to be deep. From a parental perspective, the pool is big enough for a small child to have a great afternoon with one friend (under 5 or so).Because it's not a real pool, per se, you have to let out the water constantly or it will become unsanitary. This pool is for single-day use, then drain, clean, dry, store until next time. There is no pump - there are no safe chemicals you can buy for it. You can't filter the water. I think the right price range vis a vis their likely cost to produce, market, and ship would have been about $50!

When my average height 12 year old sits in the full pool, the water hits to his neck, so it gets plenty deep enough for ""swimming"" and fun water play. Would definitely recommend. Oh! Also, it shipped and arrived sooner than the listing stated!","Fun for all ages, durable!",Verified Purchase,,,,,16709415,0,15,Public

Well, this particular pool from this company has been going strong for two weeks now without any issues. To be fair, we limited sharp-edged toys like Legos from going into the pool.

This pool is extremely easy to inflate, is very sturdy whether partially or fully filled, and is large enough for our family of five (three kids under eight and two adults) to lounge in during the heat of the day. We couldn't be more happy with the quality of this pool!",Fantastic Pool That Will Last,Verified Purchase,,,,,18630922,1,3,Public

I am an adult woman, with no children, and I purchased this pool for myself. I did not jump into the pool. I used it to lay back and float. I set up the pool on my concrete pad, which functions as my driveway. I made sure to sweep the area, so that nothing would be on the ground to poke a hole in the pool. I also purchased the same size of turf grass to place on my concrete pad so that the pool would not be touching the concrete directly. I filled up the pool just about half way to ensure that the pool was not over full. I did everything I could think of and was advised to, according the instruction manual, however, despite all my efforts the pool sprung one hole and very quickly others appeared. I think there are at least 5 holes in the pool now. For the amount of money that I spent on this pool, $110, it was a total let down to use the pool so few times and have it fail so completely.
