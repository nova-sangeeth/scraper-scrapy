I wanted it because I had a 10 month old who I knew would want to play in the massive snowstorm that was coming. We'd had a little snow before and he was frustrated when I wouldn't let him play outside for more than a couple of minutes. None of the stores had swimming pool stuff in the dead of winter (for obvious reasons), so I was glad to find this on Amazon. I inflated it, scooped some snow inside, and let him play in our living room to his heart's content. Since then I've used it as a bathtub and even bought some swim diapers and used it as a swimming pool (imagine that!) once it got hot outside.

Sure, you could assume the pool was just turned to cover that for the photos the company took. But it is impossible to turn this pool in any direction without it showing. If the distance around the pool is 9 feet, then 7 of those feet are covered in writing from top to bottom of the middle ring. This was photoshopped out to mislead people into thinking they were buying something that looked nothing like what they'd actually get. And that's the part that annoys me. I understand warnings have to be put on things like this. That's fine. But I've never seen a pool so ridiculously covered like this one.

Nope. Shone though. Tried yellow vinyl from my Cricut. That didn't work either.So if you didn't care about this stuff then I'm sure the pool would work fine for you.

My expectations were mid-grade to start with but this has just been disappointing. The pool does NOT fully inflate like the advertised pictures in the listing. We tried a bike pump first, then went to Big5 to purchase an INTEX brand pump because we thought that was the issue. Nope. Just a poorly manufactured product.

She loves bath time and splashing water, so I wanted something to set up outside so she could splash without me having to mop up afterwards. I picked this pool because of the quilted bottom to it. The inflatable quilting on the bottom gives a bit of cushioning on our concrete patio, but is not so squishy that  The pool fits nicely in one corner of the patio and was relatively fast to fill with the garden hose (maybe 3-4 minutes). As a bonus, the hot water that has been sitting in the hose mixes with the cold fresh water and you end up with a slightly cool pool rather than a really cold pool. I liked that I could pour the water out when we were done without breaking my back or feeling super wasteful. It is a bit smaller than I was thinking; my friend's have a tall one year old, and the water would only be about knee deep on her. This will probably be a ""one summer and done"" item for us due to the size, but it's holding its air well in our garage when we're not using it, and hasn't needed re-inflating after a month, so I consider that perfectly acceptable.A word of warning - I would not plan on blowing this up with your lungs. It took me three different manual air pumps to find one that worked well with it. Our bike pumps didn't work with the valve system, but the pump we have for blowing up camping air mattresses worked great.
