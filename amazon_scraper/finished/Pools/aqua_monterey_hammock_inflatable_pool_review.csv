They're just the same except color.I removed one star because of the price... these are pretty pricey.  I paid several dollars less for similar ones (different colors / pattern) at a local chain store and I found absolutely no difference in quality between these and those.  They''re even the same brand and in the same box.But if you decide to purchase these for the convenience of having them delivered to your door, here's my review...I purchased these for a six-day long vacation because I needed floats that would be lightweight and pack up fairly small.  These are perfect for that.  They pack smaller and weigh MUCH less than full-length inflatable floats.I was surprised at the quality and durability... they were excellent about holding air with very little to no leakage.  They're also easy & quick to inflate.I used them in pools and also at the beach in the protected waters near the shore.  (I am NOT advising anyone to do that... I am just telling you what *I* did.)  I weigh about 165 and they held me up well.  I never worried about tipping or going under.  I'm confident that they'll hold up ~ 200 lbs. with no trouble.  Maybe more.I think this is my favorite type of float because I could sit / recline on them but my midsection was slightly submerged.  It's much easier to keep cool that way!  Also, I find that they are easier to get on and off of than the usual full-length floats.  That's just me, though.  Your mileage may vary. :)Anyway...Reviews have helped me make LOTS of great choices, warned me about not-so-great ones and probably saved me from wasting money!

Of course I bought it. The Walmart version has cuter colors, but the mesh part is scratchy. The float I bought here is very soft.  My opinion, it’s worth the extra $3.

I had previously purchased many of the discount store floats over the years with little to no joy for my wife.  She would always complain that they were uncomfortable, too small, stuck to her, etc.... She was never happy (unless she had a cookie sheet of loaded nachos in front of her).  You see...My wife is a fairly large woman by most livestock comparisons.  We cant go to a county fair without someone putting a bid on her.....THAT big.Well I got this float and after blowing it up, I was a little skeptical.  I thought no way was this going to keep her afloat.  I even purchased the box with the guy on it, because the woman on the other box was about 1/10th her size.  To my surprise she got on and started bobbing around the pool like a tugboat trudging through rough seas.  In my mind there was no way this would last.  5...10...20...30 mins and that float was still.....FLOATING!  2 hours later, when it was time for dinner, my wife was finally willing to get out of the pool.  She came charging out of the water like an Orca coming on shore to ravage a seal and this float didn't skip a beat.It is sturdy, durable, and still going strong after several weeks.

I can't begin to express how glad I am I bought this. It is the most versatile pool float I've seen. I brought it for a massive pool party. Technically I don't think we were supposed to bring floats, but it folds up really discretely and fits easily in a luggage and I was able to pull it off. It was the perfect item because it doesn't take up much space in the pool either, you can position yourself to use it as a float or chair so if you are in packed pool it isn't really obvious and gives everyone else plenty of room to swim. It was lightweight, supported me just fine, and could be blown up after just a few blows (once you figure it out - there are two valves on top of each other for each float - the one on the bottom with the bigger hole is the one you want to use). Not sure what the poster who left the review about the blue markings is talking about, the color never rubbed off on me in any way. I loved laying in this thing and sitting in it. I love that there are so many options once it's in the water. I floated all day and didn't have to exert much effort and just got to relax. This float far exceeded my expectations.

I have 2 others that are great, but they are heavier than what I want to add to my luggage and mostly my husband doesn't stay in the water, so I decided to either just bring 1 this trip or maybe find something a little less ""deluxe"" and heavy. I settled on this one, thinking it would be a perfect choice. Only 2 pounds to pack and it could hold both of us if need be. Well, when I opened the box, I was surprised to note that it has a maximum weight limit of 250lbs. I see in the description that it does actually state that, but while I was debating size and color etc, I did not read the full details on the one I picked. Shame on me, but you should be aware. While this should be adequate for a single float, who are you going to put on this double one??? We are not that big. By my calculations, that would either be fine for 2 small women, your kids or a MAXIMUM 150lb man with a women 100lbs or less. Well... like I said, we are not that big, but 150lbs for a guy is pretty small and most women weigh over 100lbs. So unless you are a very small couple of any sex, you might want to reconsider this as a 2 person float. Maybe it would be good for a single 250lb person who needs the width, but I know, this was not what I was looking for. I will take it with us for this trip and report back, if for some reason it was great for more than that weight limit. I have my doubts. You have been warned.  - I am giving it one star, not for any other reason, than selling a 2 person float with a 250lb weight limit is as dumb as saying a small package of food has 72 servings at 15 calories each.

It takes relatively little time to blow up and deflate both ends. I am a 6'1"", 270lb guy and honestly this thing held me up perfectly. I prefer the laid out position and the chair position (meaning turning it sideways and using both ends as arm rests). I did try the saddle position but I have a feeling that getting into that position in 4-5 foot water could cause a lot of stress on the netting material (which I believe is the first place this will fail).

Over the years we have tried many floaties. These are by far the best in terms of practicality, design and usefulness. I could give a million reasons but I’ll just give the highlights. First off, they are made excellent! Nice and thick materials that shouldn’t get holes on 3.2 seconds. Gotta love that! Second, super easy to inflate! You don't need a pump. Just a few breaths and you’re done. No passing out in 95 degree sun blowing things up or fighting with a pump -sign me up! Third, easy to use! We have a family of seven and everyone fights over the two I purchased for a test run. Guess that means I meed five more! Fourth, they stay IN the pool on ridiculously windy days! Gone are the days of chasing a 6’ unicorn, flamingo, duck, peacock, swan and lord knows what else a half a mile down the fields behind our home! There’s a visual for you! So frustrating running after things that blow out because they sit high on top of the water. Fifth, storage! I havent heard hubby lose his marbles over all the crap in “his garage” since these came two weeks ago. He is not a fan of the floaties. He threatens their lives with box cutters for taking up so much space. He must have childhood floatie trauma or something. Sixth, they pack like a dream! Took them to a relatives last weekend and only needed one pool supply bag...not seventeen. Proof there is a god for those of us who despise packing! Seventh, everyone fits. Reading reviews where people complain they “dont fit” is comical. Everyone fits. Our family is all shapes and sizes and are just fine on the regular size ones. People who need to complain about the size need to learn how to use them. Unless you are 9’ tall and wide these will fit just fine. I will say they are comfortable and love that you are in the eater but able to relax and have neck support. I could float for hours! Staring at the pool and seeing these floaties while working at home is the only struggle for me because I want to be in the pool NOT working-haha!

The negative reviews had me a little hesitant to order these, but I'm glad I did. We bought the navy and white striped ones on 5-5-19 and used them at a resort in Mexico.1. They must've replaced the valves based on feedback, because the ones we received had the usual valves on inflatables. Pull out the stopper, squeeze the sides, and blow in. No problem. Deflating was easy, too.2. I opened them up and inflated them at home as soon as we received them to make sure they had no defects. Both were fine. I recommend doing this.3. There is a slight smell, but airing them out helps. It didn't bother me, but it bothered my husband a little. The thickness of the material was nicer than I had expected based on the reviews.I am actually dealing with an injury right now that makes it difficult to walk. Possibly a pinched nerve or sciatica issue. (Still getting a diagnosis on it.) Sitting upright in this hammock by straddling it in the pool with an air pillow in front of me and behind me was fantastic. It took the weight off my hip and back and it was soooo nice. I did not want to leave the pool.It was also comfortable to recline in it with my head on one pillow and knees propped up on the second air pillow. Experiment with how much air you put in each pillow and see what works best for you. You may only want to inflate them two thirds of the way or something.I found that the best way to get on it in my injured condition was to stand on the steps of the pool and put the long mesh part between my legs with a pillow in front of me and behind me and then walk down the steps into the pool. Getting onto it once in the pool would be easy enough for fit and able bodied people, but if you have any concerns about mobility, just walk into the pool with it.I cannot think of anything negative about these. They deflate and fold down as small as a shirt or pair of jeans in your suitcase. Easy.My husband is 5'8"" and 160 pounds and I'm 5'4"" and 128.

The deluxe water hammock is the perfect solution.I was pleasantly surprised to receive this replacement as it looks even nicer and comes with a storage bag the previous one didn’t have. Excellent for packing in a suitcase, lightweight and lays flat. Inflation is a cinch (less than 1 minute to inflate or deflate completely- no pump needed!), the plastic is thick and durable, and the fabric washes nicely and does not fade. Carrying handles are useful for keeping hands free when walking to the pool or beach. It’s so comfortable I can float for literally hours, and this has become one of my can’t-leave-home-without-it travel necessities.Be sure to thoroughly rinse and dry after using in sea or lake water prior to packing in a suitcase. Once home I use a sponge and vinegar/water solution then rinse. If needed, a deep clean can be done by diluting 2 tbsp bleach/1 gallon warm water, agitating with a scrub brush.

I didn't understand that what it is, is essentially two inflatable pillows, connected by a panel of open-weave mesh. I was expecting a standard pool float, where the entire length of the thing is inflatable. But I like this so much better because:• you only have to blow up the 2 pillows, so it's a lot easier to blow up than a standard float• it's super easy to carry because you can just grab the mesh in your hand (or tie it to a backpack, or whatever) and the two pillows just dangle and bounce around• it dries quicker and easier than a big long slab of plastic• it stores easily, even inflated, because ... it's just two inflated pillows and a sheet of mesh• the mesh middle is what makes it so versatile - as the item description says, you can lie back on it, sit on it, use it to support your chest while you lie on your stomach ...The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's a wee bit short. I'm only 5'10"" and I felt like my legs were dangling a bit weirdly, and it would have been fixed by an extra couple inches on the mesh panel. If you're taller than 6-feet, I worry that you won't be comfortable trying to lie back and float on it.

If you like to move and water is your element you will love it.First i thought that it was leaking air,  since i blew it up to the max. And when i got it in the pool, it sort of deflated a bit.The next day when i looked at it it was really hot and it was firm fulled with air, then went to the pool again and deflated a bit. LOL guess what? I forgot about physics class in 7th grade 😂 hot air takes up more space than cold air! So in the cold water pool the same amount of air collapesd and in the heat it got bigger. Duuuhhh. I almost returned it as defected, but didn't want to because I enjoyed it so much I'm glad i waited a day and gave it some time. So if it happens to you, it's not defected, you will see, it will be firmer in the heat without adding more air.Easy to get on, sit in the net first and then lean while you turn to lay down. Love how i can sit on it and have a conversation or just swim with it while not on it, by having it under my arms hugging them.

You can use this in so many different ways whether lounging, sitting or swimming. I like to use it while sit/floating - you can use like a swing/sling (with floats under arms), you can straddle sit (with floats in front and back of you) or you can swim/float on your stomach (with floats under your armpits). You can use it like a floating devise while swimming forwards and backwards with arms stretched in front of your head (like a paddle board), it’s really so versatile!! You can even use it for tanning if you keep your body straight enough and it works your core a little while you balance without putting stress on your neck (especially if you adjust how much air you want in each float). It can be a little challenging to lay flat on your stomach to tan your backside but if you keep one leg straight and the other slightly bent out to your side, and then release some air from the neck float it’s manageable and doesn’t hurt your neck. I like to lay an my back and do leg lifts while floating (with one float under my neck and the other under my knees) and do small sit-ups by bringing my knees forward with the head float supporting my head. There’s no pressure On your spine since your floating by you can feel the burn in your tummy. I also like to use it for stretching my legs/IT band by putting one leg in at a time with the mesh part in the water gathered/resting by your ankle. I use the resistance of the floats to stretch by leaning forward and rotating my leg.My favorite is to just lay with one pillow under my neck and the other below my knees, with my arms straight out, eyes closed- just free floating. It feels so nice because your body stays in the water because of the sling/swing & your neck and head rest comfortably on the neck float. Perfect size for my short legs 5’4. My husband can use it too at 5’10 but I think the larger size would be more comfortable for him to fully stretch and lounge his long legs. If you need more room on the sides and don’t want your arms hanging freely in the water, get the larger one because I read it’s wider and longer. This one has just enough coverage to clear my hips and not too long for my height. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

The floats have an inflatable insert for the pillow, and the rest of the float is made up of foam rods (like really skinny pool noodles) sewn into channels. They are comforable to float on, although you end up more submerged than with some other inflatable floats. (Which was fine with us, it helped us beat the heat.) Since the trip, we have been using the floats in our pool. I can see us using these for a few years, as opposed to fully inflatable floats that get holes in them and have to be repaired or thrown away. You could also use the floats to lie on the beach, but I can't see using them as a yoga mat (as one of the photos on the package shows) - that would be really bumpy and uncomfortable. The only downside I found was with the quality of the stitching. On the first use, the stitching came apart along a seam by the pillow. Once I got the floats home, I noticed that the other one had stitching coming apart along two of the channels.

Took it in the ocean, laid back on it and bounced up and down in the waves. Never toppled over and they were good sized, fairly rough waves. If you lay/sit on it with the inflated ends under your head and feet you'll stay on top of the waves. It's really incredible but I didn't get thrown off or slammed in the back of the head by the waves, just kept bobbing on top of them. I laughed like a little kid in the rocket ship outside the Piggly Wiggly.Wish i had a picture but nobody wanted to go back to the car to get a camera, sorry. I can definitely tell you this chair is a riot, I had more fun on it than I do with my boogie board. It's good, tough vinyl, fairly thick, held up perfectly. Don't know how it would do if it ran up against a rock. In a lake or pool I think it would hold up forever as long as you didn't try to intentionally pop it. I'll probably order another one. Takes up less room in the trunk than my boogie board. This thing is so fun, my favorite Amazon purchase.Update, Jan 2020:Took it to the ocean with me during 2019, the second season I had it, Good Harbor Beach in Gloucester, MA. There's a river that rolls along near the shore then out to the open water, a lot of beach-goers float along in this river out to the ocean instead of going straight into the ocean (you can do either one at GH). I jumped in the river with my floatie, laid across the netting with the ""airbags"" on my right and left sides and was merrily kicking my way to the ocean until some 17 year old life guard started yelling at me. He told me those kinds of floatie devices aren't allowed there and directed me to bring it out of the water. I asked why and first he said 'I don't know' and then he said safety issues. I was disgusted. I had to slosh out of the water and leave it onshore then go in the ocean.Yes, this is relevent to my review. I realized the problem is those gigantic floatie things shaped like a piece of pizza or watermelon or a huge swan, etc, that people have been floating away on. They drift a few days out to deep sea they realize it and have to be rescued by Captain America.  So now Good Harbor Beach is classifying this floatie the same as those monstrous floaties and banning them. It might be the same at ocean beaches across the US. And the Great Lakes.So, maybe check with the beach you plan to go to beforehand and see if they'll allow a floatie like this one. They might not. The water wasn't nearly as fun without my floatie. I'll have to drop a note to the Good Harbor Beach council and see if they'll reconsider their stance bcz this is not like those crazy big floatie things, that are kind of like an air mattress, where you lose all sense of what's going on and float off to China. It's small and you're bobbing around too much to not pay attention or be aware of where you are in the water.",Ingenius design,Color: Orange – HammockVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,83898,561,232,Public

They eventually sprang a leak, but they had over 6 or 7 months of daily use across 2 summer seasons. Honestly, I didn't expect them to last even that long.  I've seen some of the tears and quality issues reported by other users, but we didn't have any problems.  We did treat them pretty gently, and mostly kept the kids from using them for anything other than relaxing. That being said, the deluxe model is definitely more comfortable and seems much studier.  Overall, I would say that both models are ridiculously comfortable to recline on, but if you are on a tight budget or buying for children, get the cheaper model.  If you are looking for a sturdier and more premium experience, the deluxe model is defintely several steps up in quality and durability. Either way, these hammocks transformed our pool experience by making it comfortable for adults to lounge in for longer periods of time.  While the kids play for hours, my wife and I can relax and enjoy ourselves too.","Ridiculously comfortable, deluxe resort model fabric/netting is softer on skin than basic model",Color: Hammock Navy & GreenVerified Purchase,,,2067807,708,22,Public

The leak was on the seam where the net fabric is stitched to the float so I could not patch it. I e-mailed their customer support and did not ask for or demand a replacement. I simply asked if they had a warranty and if what was wrong with my float would be covered. The woman requested a picture, which I sent, and then she said she'd see what they can do. Today, I received a surprise in the mail. They sent me a replacement. That's good customer service for an issue they may have been able to say ""that's normal wear and tear"" or what have you.

Very comfortable to lay on and is perfect in a pool as well as the ocean. This purchase was made for a pregnant woman to be able to lay in multiple positions comfortably and it did achieve this objective. Very compact and easy to transport when either inflated or deflated. Materials appear to be sturdy enough to hold up to normal use, though this user has only used the item for 1 week of daily ocean and pool use as of this writing.A downside preventing a 5 star review is the plug to inflate. The inflation plug has two separate mechanisms built in (one for a pump, the other with your mouth). The mouth doesn't have a check valve when inflating and will deflate quickly before you can close the plug, so it can be very tricky to inflate fully without using a hand pump.",A surprisingly good purchase,Color: Resort Hammock Antigua BlueVerified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,,56516499,7,1,Public

It's too wide to straddle comfortably so you either need to lay on your back or sit in it like a chair with a pillow under each arm. It is comfortable to lay on and keeps you afloat pretty well. Overall not bad for the price.,Does its job,Color: Blue LightVerified Purchase,,,119375,,,

I wanted something easy to inflate and use at the lake.  I love that I can sit and float or lay back.  It’s durable and all my friends stole it to use when I wasn’t.  It has its own bag and deflates and folds up in a snap.  No more dealing with a compressor.,The best float,Color: Resort Hammock Antigua BlueVerified Purchase,,,823638,22,98,Public

In the box, unopened, in my closet. I Still have it at the ready to use and HOPE it is easy to get on to with Chronic pain. I can't use many muscles and need ease... It's already put off from testing THIS season...with a water park a block away!!!!
