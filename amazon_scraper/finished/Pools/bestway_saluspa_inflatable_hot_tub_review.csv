I have been looking at this particular hot tub for two years now and finally ordered it. I've looked at others and have looked at reviews for all and I decided that this was what I wanted to go with. Time will tell on how long it will last but I thought I would get a few initial impressions out there.  It is larger than I expected and fits 2 people easily.  I would not put any more adults in this tub except maybe a third but leg room would become uncomfortable after this.  I am happy with the 104-degree temperature.  It is hot and I feel immediately soothed and relaxed.  I was not expecting it to feel this warm because the reviews said it would not get extremely hot but it is hot enough for my husband and I.  I live in a warmer climate and have it outdoors on a wood platform between it and the cement and it is protected under a balcony.  It has stayed 104 consistently even in chillier temperatures around 42-50 degrees. It has dropped to strangely cold temps here a few days and it still does great and keeps it up.  This is not designed for climates that are consistently under 40 degrees.  Set up was fairly easy and I pulled up some videos on the website by looking up Miami Jet.  I am very happy it has a nice cover and the hot tub inflates itself with the heat pump provided.  I have the chemicals needed and am finding it easy enough to maintain and not entirely difficult to understand.  I ordered a chemical kit that had the necessities.  I have wanted this tub for two years and I am actually happier then I thought I would be.  The bottom is comfortable and thicker than expected.  Its really quite nice and we have had company enjoy it as well.  It surpasses my expectations at this point.  I will continue to update in the following months.Update-  I have had this hot tub for several months now and my husband and I use it daily and sometimes more than one a day on the weekends (morning, afternoon, night)  The bubbles are fantastic and the temp is quite hot.  104 is hot.  I am so happy and thankful we have this.  It is easy to take care of with chemicals and the filters are easy to change.  We take the cover off together usually but its decently easy to take it off by myself and put it back on.  So nice.Update- we have had it for over half of a year and we use it every single day. It’s easy to care for and I use Bromine instead of clorine. I read Bromine withstands heat better.Update- at the 9 month mark the hot tub heater began to leak. This has a full one year warranty and I was assisted with the issue quickly. Iwould buy this tub again. I still use it every single day as does my husband.Update- if you ever get an Eo2 reading you may need to change the impeller. This is easy enough and it is called the active aqua impeller 400 gph. I used this on the old pump that was leaking and fixed it.They do not fix parts on pumps. They send out a new pump if yours breaks under warranty.  I fixed the internal part myself by watching a few YouTube videos. Just a heads up if it's outside of warranty.Update two years now- we moved and brought the hot tub with us. It survived and we are still using it every night. It's even better this time of year when it's cold. We would order again.",Ive looked at this hot tub for two years and compared others and happy I ordered-update,Verified Purchase,952 people found this helpful,,174,,,
Richard Elgar,/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFRL427JRM74H4RLDZPU754DLMTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2015",5,,https://www.amazon.com/SaluSpa-Miami-AirJet-Inflatable-Hot/product-reviews/B00HRT863U/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this for a solid couple of months now, so probably a good time to evaluate it. I'm going to start out by noting that this is the third one that I bought over the summer. The other two had slow, and not so slow punctures, so I returned both of them after a little bit of use, and I've been using this one since the middle of August.I've used it pretty much every night. I've had a visitor use it, and my son has done too. It's a decent size for me and an eight year old, and I guess if you knew the folks, or wanted to, you could get in with 2 others, but you'd be in contact.As you can see from the photos, I decided to create a bit of a platform for it. That's because the small patch of lawn I have is very hilly/ bumpy, and I wanted a more level pool.So the good things you can probably get from the other reviews. I've loved using it, and am now thinking of moving it into my garage for the winter - I enjoy using it, but it will go below freezing soon enough and I know that the pump can't handle that!The things I've learned are hard to find information on but here's what I got.1. I'm still not sure about balancing the chemicals. I used bromine tablets, used something at the start to supposedly produce a bromine reserve, but every time I've measured the chemicals using a test strip, it registers almost no bromine. I don't know what to do about that.2. Probably related to that - despite using bromine, a bromide solution as above, clarifying solution and cleaning the filters regularly, the water still went cloudy and then foamy. The first time it was after about 6 weeks, the second time after 2 weeks. Both times I was tempted to apply a shock treatment, but instead just drained the water to start again. When I refill the pool in the garage I'll try to be more on the chemicals, but it just may be that I need to just change the water every two or three weeks, especially if it's used as much as I use it!3. I don't know if it's connected, but the punctures both appeared after I pumped the hot tub up quite a lot. Maybe it's better if it's not too rigid. Like I say, I don't know if it's connected, but slightly less pressure in the tub now and I haven't had a leak!4. To inflate the tub you use the same pump that you use for bubbles. If you need to inflate it at all later, it's a real pain to disconnect, inflate, and reconnect. I found it way easier to use a plug in inflator - something like   120 Volt AC Portable Electric Air Pump for Mattress Inflatables with Three Nozzles          ,5. I also used hot water from the house to fill the tub up. Personally, I think next time I'll just fill it up from the hose and allow the 2 days for it to heat up (which is how long it took here in eastern WA, even in the summer).6. The final thing I learned was...well actually I didn't learn this. I expected it, and it was true. It is brilliant to just sit in the hot tub looking up at the stars. When I was there with my son we saw the meteor showers this summer, and generally this works well and provides an excellent experience for around 10% or less than the cost of a 'real' hot tub. It's a bit redneck, but I'm OK with that and I haven't regretted buying it for a second!***UPDATE OCTOBER 2016So, I kept the hot tub in my garage, and it has given pretty much flawless service. I started using a non-chlorine shock treatment on a more regular basis, kept an eye on the bromine tablets, and subsequently have been getting a month or more between water changes. Quite happy about that. So happy in fact, that at the end of the season, when the price of the spas went down, I bought another one to keep in reserve. What I did not know at the time was that the model has been updated, and there is one quite significant change.The new hot tub is shallower. I'm 6'3"" so that is not fantastic as far as I'm concerned, although I can deal with it! It's probably going to be better for kids and people who aren't that tall. Another change is that the walls of the hot tub are thinner - not the material, but the distance between the outside and the water. This means that although it's shallower, there's more leg room in the tub, making it more comfortable I guess when you have more than one person in the tub.They've also updated the heater. I only used the basic functions, but it does seem to have a couple of updated features. Another thing I noticed is that the power cord is now thicker. That's probably a good thing! It's still highly recommended...but...the one I received didn't do so well on its test run. One of the connections between the heater and the pool (that goes to a filter) was a little askew, which meant that it was a real PITA to attach. Really quite difficult to get it tight enough that it wouldn't leak. Also, the bottom surface of the one I received wasn't properly glued to the base of the tub, so it kind of filled with air. I spoke to Bestway about this, and they have told me that they will replace the tub. I'll update this review as needed.*** UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2018So it finally died over the summer - in June or July, meaning that I got just under 3 years use out of it, at least every other day, probably more like 3 out of 4 days, meaning that it was used hundreds of times. I don't regret buying it for a second, but I wish I had been able to repair the tiny hole that appeared. It was on a seam so the vinyl patch wouldn't work, and I couldn't make vinyl repair glue work either. So, I started using the one that I mention above that I bought in October 2016 for a very reasonable price (yes, it was sitting in my garage for almost 2 years).The new one is a bit shallower as I mention above, but it seems (although I may be wrong) that the internal dimensions are slightly larger because the walls of the tub are thinner. The new heater seems a little more intuitive, but more importantly, the connections are bit easier to make between the tubes from the heater and the water circulator and the tub itself. My one complaint that I don't think I mentioned above in my review was just how ridiculously hard it was to unscrew and screw back in all the connecting tubes when you change the water (you have to do that otherwise there is no easy way to drain the water). It was really cumbersome, especially in the winter when it was a bit chilly in my unheated garage, and it was way to easy to strip the threads, meaning I needed to use plumbing tape). I hated it, and it always took much longer to do. But no more. The new connections sit slightly further out, and so far it has been remarkably easy to change the water, which I haven't done loads because......yeah, it turns out that using a shock treatment in the tub helps keep the water clearer. And also, cleaning the filters every few days. I should probably even do that every other day. So far what I've been doing is hosing the filters thoroughly, and that seems to get rid of all the accumulated stuff. I will change the filters every 2 months or so in the summer, but probably more frequently in the winter when the snow and cold weather makes it harder to hose those down.I'll add a photo when I get a chance of the new one in the garage. It's still highly recommended in my view!***",Redneck hot tub - UPDATED due to new model,Verified Purchase,"1,020 people found this helpful",,44192,1118,47,Public

After running gloriously for two weeks, it started throwing the dreaded error code E02.  After doing mighty battle with the plucky little hot tub, here is what I learned about diagnosing and fixing E02.  These are roughly in the order of how likely they are to occur.  First, ALWAYS START WITH THE FILTERS.  If your filters are old or dirty, it makes all the other problems worse.  In particular, because the plumbing between the filter and the pump is a low pressure system, it's prone to drawing air INTO the tubes. So, if your filters are dirty, the pump has to pull harder against the filters, causing even lower pressure and drawing even more air in.  Once enough air starts getting in, it can form bubbles that are big enough to interfere with the water flow sensor, which trips E02.=====  Reason #1: Dirty filters  =====To diagnose:- Unscrew filter assembly, open it up and have a look.To fix:- Hose that bad boy down.  Bestway says to do this daily.  If the filter is clogged with goo and algea, I haven't had any luck cleaning it out, you just have to change it.=====  Reason #2: OLD filters  =====To diagnose:- If your filters have been submerged for more than two or three weeks, the paper-based material gets soggy and congeals together, significantly restricting water flow.  You REALLY DO have to replace them every two or three weeks, even if they don't look dirty.- To confirm this is causing problems, remove one filter and run the pump, putting your hand over the return inlet to feel the jet of water.  If the water stops flowing as soon as you reconnect the filter (and you then get E02), it means the filter is the only thing obstructing water flow.To fix:- Replace the filters! Amazon has a pack of 12 for $40.=====  Reason #3: Air leaking in at the connectors near filters  =====To diagnose:- With the pump off, bleed all of the air out of the transparent vinyl ""side hose"" by slowly loosening the connectors on either side (some water will drip out)- Re-tighten connectors- Turn the pump on, and watch for bubbles to gather in the hose, or listen for a faint hissing- Elevate middle of hose gently to cause any bubbles to gather in the middle of the tube where you can see themTo fix:- Tighten the connectors; consider wrapping threads in teflon tape- Be sure to hold filters underwater until all air is purged before screwing them on, otherwise it migrates into the tube===== Reason #4: Air leaking in at pump connectors within the egg  =====To diagnose:- With all other sources of air ruled out, turn the pump on and listen for air going through it (sounds irregular and gurgley, like when you first start a garbage disposal with a big chunk of food).  You can also look for bubbles EXITING the egg through the short transparent bit of hose behind connector C.- Gently twist the ""T"" connector (B) going into the egg by lifting/lowering the side hose.  If the air sounds get worse, one of the two seals inside is broken.  (You really have to baby this connector otherwise, especially when the water is cold and the vinyl is stiff).To fix:- Flip the egg over and remove the bottom panel- Loosen the hose clamps on either side of the short piece of vinyl tub within- Heat both ends of the tube up with a heat gun or blow dryer- Re-seat both ends on the external connector and the pump, and tighten the hose clamps behind the barb on the fitting=====  Reason #5: Side hose is too short, pulling a kink in short hose behind elbow connector  =====To diagnose:- Examine the short tube behind the elbow connector (embedded inside the tub) to see if it's collapsed badly enough to restrict water flow.To fix:- Buy a foot of vinyl tubing (1"" ID, 1.25"" OD) from Home Depot ($2.50)- Cut the side hose in half (voiding your warranty, of course), and splice it back together again with the new hose, but with 2 or 3 inches extra in the middle- To do the splice, heat up the new hose with a heat gun (or blow dryer) and work it over the cut ends of the side hose (I was able to get 5 inches of overlap on either side, making the side hose 2 inches longer total)- Fit two wormscrew hose clamps (<$1 each) over the middle of the overlaps while the vinyl is still warm.  Be careful that they don't have any sharp edges near the tub wall.=====  General thoughts  =====- It's not good to run the pump dry, so when you first turn it on, either let is soak for an hour (to allow water to work its way in through the filters), or unscrew a filter to let water rush in all at once (albeit unfiltered).  If you don't do this, you'll almost certainly get E02 a couple of times before the pump fills up enough to support water flow.- The tub deflates a bit after first inflation, because the warm water works all the wrinkles out- The vinyl side hose and second filter are a design afterthough from Bestway.  The early setup videos and product photos don't show it or mention it.  I believe that's why it causes so many problems, it needs some redesign.  The biggest issue is that moving the side hose around can really torque the T connector going into the egg, loosening one or both of the seals within.- I believe rubbing and brushing the filter when you wash it just packs the gunk into it further, recommend water only.- When installing the tub in a location, don't allow the egg to get squeezed against a wall, which will push on connector C and crush the pump supply tube inside.  Remember that the tub walls expand as you fill it, so allow a couple inches between the egg and any walls or railing.  This was probably my biggest mistake of the whole adventure.- I didn't get to this point (thankfully), but if you get really desperate and give up on the whole thing (after voiding your warranty), the component parts of the spa are in high demand on ebay.  You can part out a Lay-z spa for as much as it's worth, if you're patient and don't mind shipping things.- As with any hot tub, there's a significant cost to operating the thing, almost entirely because of the heater.  Running the pump flat out to keep the tub at 104 degrees cost us about $100/month.  That was in the winter, with an ambient temperature of ~40 degrees.  Electricity is 11.8 cents/kWh for us, so I think the 2kW heater was on about two thirds of the time.  By bringing the temperature down to 102, and turning the heater off completely on days we don't use it (about half the time), the cost dropped to ~$35/month.  I think I'm losing a lot of heat through the slab it's installed on though, despite a foam pad, so I may put it up on a short platform to see if I can decrease cost further (I am very cheap).",How to fix error code E02,Verified Purchase,186 people found this helpful,,1482496,705,26,Public

At this price it's about the price of a 2-3 day hotel stay with a professional spa, but lasts a LOT longer than that.As to the negatives: there is no seat, no ""jets"" that you would imagine in a professional grade tub, no lights and the temp gets to only 104, and takes a while to get there.As to the positives: cost.  As another reviewer pointed out, most people want a lounger, with jets for your neck, back, arms, legs and feet but to get that you're talking $8-10k AT LEAST.  This has an easy set up and easy fill, with easy operation.  I set this up in my basement and with a large dehumidifier can keep the humidity to around 45% which is more than safe.  While it doesn't have ""jets"" that you would picture at a professional jacuzzi it does have a LOT of rolling bubbles and when you lean back against it gives the same effect.  Not the ""flesh pounding"" you'd get with the professional grade but feels like a light massage on your back and neck.  The lid does a GREAT job of not only locking in the heat but the humidity also.  Make sure you keep up on bromine etc just like with all hot tubs and you'll have no problem.  Even with the drawbacks listed above, I would highly recommend it.  Underwater lights are a bit tacky (IMO), and I was on the fence about the bubbles and no jets but they come out and foam up at such a rate it does the job and I'm happy with it.  The temp gets to only 104 but I have found that sufficient.  With professional level spas they can get to 115 and while I have found it feels nice, I can only do 15 minutes and usually get out a bit dizzy.  At 104 it's about right.  The heat penetrates the muscles and when you get out you're not dizzy from the heat and no ""temperature shock"" from leaving it.  I would like to say the temp goes from 104 to 100 within 10 minutes but I have not found an issue with that as the heater will kick on and keep it in that range.One warning I would like to say is that if you have any images of sitting in it with snow falling on your hair etc...forget it.  As with all hot tubs it injects ambient air into the water to create the bubbles and what do you think happens to 104 water when you inject 28 degree air?  That's right, the temperature tanks faster than the heater can heat it up, real quick.While the professional level tubs can hack it, this one can't.  I don't have a problem with that because this runs off a 110 v circuit and professional tubs require 220 or more and come with an electric bill to match.  This tub will add about $8 /wk to your bill while a professional level tub will jack your bill by 20% or more, easy.  Probably close to 30% if it's outside in the winter (I used to own one at a previous house I lived in).All in all, for the price point it outperformed my expectations.  If you're buying it expecting professional grade, you're going to be disappointed.  You won't get the pounding jets, lounger and broiling hot water, but you won't be paying $8-10k with a 30% jack in your electric bill, forever and ever Amen, either.  On the other hand, if you're up for a hot soak after work with a light massage, this is for you.",Perfect for the price,Verified Purchase,"1,238 people found this helpful",,2320121,1476,12,Public

Reduced the air in the hot tub but still looked deformed and the sides had too little of air in it.We used it one time before it popped.........never again lasted just over a year.Spend the extra and buy the better Coleman version. Heavy duty walls and construction.*****UPDATE*****9/14/2018Had the hot tub for the about 5 months now it held air but looks like a bloated marshmallow on the top in spots. The top ring is not even, you will see others with pictures of what I am speaking about. I also found that you will need to watch how full it is with air. It seams to expand in the summer heat and got really tight. Also the side wall are not straight up and down, and have more of a inner curved look. So the top and bottom of the side wall sticks out more. Not sure if this is a defect or how it was made. Our old Coleman Saluspa have flat wall top to bottom.The inside graphics have all warn away no big deal but this adds to how cheap this unit really is made. I really don't think I will try and use this in the garage in the winter this year. For some reason I really don't trust that it will last through the winter. And from what I have read most people that have stored it have had leak issues the following year. So it sounds like a one year kind of hot tub.My original pump from my Coleman Saluspa last just over two year, the o-rings inside started to deteriorate away and started to leak. The old pump was run everyday for the two years in the summer and winter. I have had to use the new pump that came with this unit and so far so good time will tell.So bottom line looks like we are stuck with a wavy topped $300.00 kiddie pool, just waiting for it doom.****Old review*****We previously owned a Coleman Saluspa. And loved the hot tub using it almost daily and year round outside and in the garage in the winter. Iwill ad we live in Chicago and had -10 degree weather this year. In a non-heated garage it worked perfect.But I used an air compressor to blow it up as I could not reach the valve with the filler hose and attach it to the pump.  And overnight the beams inside blew out as I put too much air in it. My bad, so thus is why I purchased this model. I wasn't going to spend another $400 bucks. Though well I'll save some money buy this one cant be that different.Big mistake, as a former owner of the 77"" x 28"" Coleman Saluspa all I can say is this was a huge mistake. And even thought I paid under $300 and bought a Amazon warehouse like new damaged package. Btw it was in perfect no damaged shape never been opened.This hot tub is a disappointment which I will explain.1- the bubble jets only go a little more than half way around the tub. So between the two filters you have no jets just dead space. On the bigger model you have jets all the way around. What is this the no wake zone? I understand this model only has 60 jets compared to the 120 the bigger model has but really?2- The second filter inlet tube runs on the outside of the hot tub? Great design flaw and why you will not be able to use this at all in colder weather. As you will be constantly loosing heat to the exposed tube. The larger model has the tube built into the side wall. I did not run the tube and left the cap on the inlet. You will not be able to do this as I still have my old pump. You can cap the pump inlet but will need to buy a cap. But if you run the hose buy some pipe insulation foam to keep the heat in the tube.3- Just doesn't seam to fill as tight as the bigger model. Looks cheap and flimsy once filled and the security top cover  is not snug like the bigger model and sits loose around the edge. Almost looks like a kiddie pool really when filled shinny and cheap looking. Plus you get no gauge to tell you it is full. Just a filler tube. So you run it for awhile and it just stops filling. Again it looks under filled and cheap.4- No ground cover pad included? Nothing no tarp no bubble pad? The bigger model comes at least with a bubble pad. Buy some foam to put under it and a tarp.5- This will hold two people tops. I am 215 lbs and the wife is 130. If our ten year old comes in we are right on top of each other. So good for one or two comfortably. Any more or if you are bigger buy the next size up.Bottom line spend the extra $100 and buy the 77"" x 28"" model. You will thank me later it is just much better built. if I would have not used the compressor to fill the old Coleman Saluspa I would not be leaving this review.Only plus I will say because this the Bestway model and not the Coleman. You can get an extended warranty on it if you register it within 15 days of purchase. This is not offered on the Coleman. Why is this important just read the reviews on pump issues and you will see why.Also it is still hot water and bubble jets so yes it is relaxing.On the pump I have this new one as a backup and I am using my older pump from my first hot tub as all the connections are the same.","Spend extra and buy the 77"" x 28"" Coleman Saluspa model you'll thank me later.",Verified Purchase,22 people found this helpful,,83762175,169,105,Public

It says 4 person, but really I think its too small for more than 2 people less you're all really friendly!Keep in mind as you read this, that I had to sell my full sized hot tub during a divorce and moved into a rental. I missed my tub terribly and wanted a good alternative. This was the perfect solution!!First off, assembly was a snap. Using the blower as the inflator was a genius touch making it simple to blow up. Once blown up, it can be moved around empty really easily. Its just a mini version of an intex pool, made of the same great materials and bromine safe.The heater runs on 110 house voltage so it must be expected that it is slow to heat water. Compared to a big tub. No worries. Set the heater to 104 and give it a day or so and your ready to go. Make it go faster by emptying your hot water tank into it. Few times! Or, learn to be patient!The top is really important and must be kept properly inflated. When not being used, the top must be kept on to keep the heat in. We have used it for up to two hour in sub freezing temps and only lost 4 degrees, but your mileage may vary. So far its had no problem keeping 102-104 down into the teens outside and my electric bill has gone up $12. Seriously, twelve bucks.The bottom is padded and quite comfy to sit on. My shoulders are under water when seated on my butt. They offer a drunk holder and a pillow for this little gem, I recommend them both.The blower motor must have been updated because its not noisy at all. In fact I cant hear it over the AMPLE bubbles it makes!Overall, this was a fantastic buy! Having a hot tub when I thought I was going to be without was great.

So far I am beyond pleased with my purchase. Btw I live in Houston and I plan on updating this frequently.Review After 3 weeks:As I am a single woman I first unpacked everything in my garage and then made 3 trips with the items to my back patio. I had the hot tub inflated and filling with water in under an hour. I am 5’ 10” and can definitely say this is for 2 people only. The materials seem to be good quality - although I wouldn’t sit on the sides like some people do with the other brands. It heated up to 104 degrees overnight and stayed at that temp for the hour I was in it WITH the air bubbles. I should say I have not run the heater since then, well cause again I live in Texas. Chemicals took about a week to figure out. None come with the hot tub and so far I’ve had to purchase: Chlorine, Shock, pH up and calcium. At a total investment of $350 even if this only lasts me a year I’m beyond happy.",Awesome Hot Tub - Definitely Recommend!,Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,,5445394,6,14,Public

The pumps that come with both are almost identical (except one major difference which I'll explain later) so my review will be mostly based on comparing the two tubs themselves (the inflatable part).  Because I started with the more robust tub I will admit I prefer it by far, so I have rated this one based on what it is supposed to be on it's own merit and value in comparison with the Coleman (that is only about $25 more).The Coleman tub is listed as 2"" taller and 6"" wider than this ""Miami"" model.  Long story short, when sitting in the Coleman with robust textured walls that you can put your full body weight on (sitting on the side wall without pushing it down enough to spill water), I felt like I was sitting in a legit grownup hot tub.  This Miami one's walls are thinner (far less forgiving of being leaned on & def wouldn't sit on), and the plastic is also thinner; it's made of a slick pool-float style plastic.  The tub is noticeably smaller both just observing the physical size and in roominess when inside of it.  In the Miami I almost felt like I was sitting in an over-sized Kiddie Pool.  For a single on a budget the Miami might be fine just to have some way to get a soak, but if you want something that can stand up to rambunctious kids or guests- spring for that extra $25.These tubs provide massage by way of a pump pushing air through a ring of plastic with holes in it that goes around the bottom inside of the tub; it is certainly louder than a traditional hot tub with water jets (the sound of the bubbles breaking at the top of the water is pretty loud- it's not the pump's fault) but the trade off is a more intense massage than you get with water jets.  However, the other disappointing thing about the Miami tub is that the ""bubble ring"" that goes around the bottom inside of the tub doesn't go all the way around, so there's a dead zone around the pump intakes where there is less bubble action and you have to consider that when choosing where to place the filter- unfortunately for me I had no choice but to put it right where I'm inclined to hang out most of the time so it was nearly a deal breaker right there.  The Coleman's ""bubble ring"" is 360'.*Technically* the pump that comes with the Miami is not compatible with the Coleman because of the way the intakes are.  Both tubs have two intakes inside the tub that pull in untreated water to the filter, but the Coleman's hoses are built into the sidewalls and merge down into one port that you screw from the tub into the pump body.  The Miami's pump looks exactly the same (the egg part that sits outside of the tub) except since the Miami's walls are too thin to accommodate the hoses, there's a secondary hose coming off the connection (on the pump side) that runs over to the second intake in the tub around the *outside* of the tub.  Although it's not supported, I was able to use the Miami's pump with my Coleman tub by capping off that second intake (on the pump side) and making sure it was pulling in enough water through the one remaining one as to not cause any issues with the pump/heater/sensors.  Hooked up that way it works just like the original green Coleman pump did so far but I'm sure using this way voids any warranty I might've enjoyed.In short since this one is only $25 or so cheaper than the larger Bestways (and the Coleman branded Bestway), I'd have expected the tub to be of the same quality as the Coleman and just be a bit smaller... but it's very disappointing in that regard.  For the quality of the Miami tub, I would've expected to pay at *least* $50 less than I paid for the Coleman.  I'll keep it in case my Coleman tub becomes irreparable, but in the meantime I'm happy to have a pump back for my big Green Hot Tubbing Machine.Side Note:  If you've never owned a hot tub, remember you *must* keep the cover on it when not in use for the tub to retain heat even with the heater on.  These ""egg"" style pump/filter/heater combos are notorious for burning out early too but since you're not paying for a robust heater/pump I don't feel like that's a reason to bash the purchase... the flimsy tub is though.",Much Less Robust Than the Coleman,Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,,166496,201,35,Public

The first one lasted me 3 summers, this would've been the 4th.  I went to put it up, and the heater/pump still worked, but there was a small hole I couldn't find in the tub part.I live in Michigan and use the spa non-stop from May to Oct.  Here are some tips to get it to last for you:1. Put foam mats under the tub.  This will help the tub last longer and give you a little cushion to sit on.  I used camping mats.2. Only run the heater/pump non-stop until you get it hot.  After that utilize the timer function.  More on that later.3. Run the filters through the dishwasher at least once a week.  One set will last you all summer.4. To keep it clean, use a foot bath/wash, before entering the tub.  Get a small spa size skimmer for the floaties.  To get sand and stuff that has sunk to the bottom, I use a super soaker, suck up the bottom dwellers, then I'll run it thru the skimmer, putting the hot water back in the spa, and catching the sand and stuff in the skimmer net.5. Always keep the top on when not in use.  This keeps it clean and keeps it hot.Here is how I use the timer:There is a button that has 2 timers on it.  When you push it once, the one that looks like a stopwatch will blink first, that is how long you want your heater/pump to run for, push the arrow keys to how many hours you want it running.  Push the button again and the one that looks like a clock is in how many hours you want your heater/pump to turn on.This is what I do after I go in the spa at night, I shut down the heater and set the timer to turn the heater on in 8 hrs, to heat for 2 hrs.  That way it'll be ready and hot for me in the morning before work.  After I get out in the morning, I set the timer to turn the heater on in hrs, to heat for 2 hrs, that way it'll be ready for me when I get home from work.  I might leave it on all evening if we're going from the pool to the spa, and back again.  This way, you're not eating up energy just keeping it hot when it doesn't have to be.When warm out, 60-90 degrees, I only pre-warm it for 2 hrs max, in colder weather, 40-60 degrees I'll pre-warm for 3-4 hrs.You can't ask for much more at this price point.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but I think that is for a REAL picture, and a picture combined with the proper words are priceless.  Just saying.  Anyway, it didn't take too long to get it all figured out and an hour or so after taking the box to the back patio it was filling with water.  A few hours later, my wife and I hopped in and were so pleased with our purchase.  If you figure the cost of the least expensive fiberglass tub at around $3000, you could buy a new one of these each year and still come out ahead.  I expect this to last a few years if taken care of.  We shall see, but for now I am elated at our bargain.  I definitely would recommend this to my friends and family.

When the bubbles are on the heater unit sounds like a shop vac, but once you are inside the tub the bubbles drown out that noise.  The water temperature only goes down about 4-5 degrees depending on how long you stay in. It stay warm for a long time. I also enjoy sitting in it without the bubbles on! Make sure you put the inflatable top inside the cover, it fits inside the cover, they are not two separate pieces. A good seal will keep the water warm. I leave the heater on all the time. I saw a video that recommended that keeping the heater on will save money in the long run...we will see what my utility bill looks like. This tub is well worth it during this difficult pandemic.

I plumbed in a Penn plax 1200 aquarium filter which increases flow and needs cleaning only once a month. The filter needs to be off when the heater is started or it has a fault which requires a good thump on the heater to reset. The seams inside the tub will start to fail after about a year. Careful patching with Tear-aid type B and a heat gun will make a good repair, but requires draining the water to be able to do a good job. I think they are just a little sloppy when they weld the seams at the Chinese factory.As one user has recommended, initial heating with a propane gas water heater and a good submersible pump can give you full temps in a matter of hours after filling with a garden hose.I have found the Tear-aid B type unable to take the temperature/water, and pulls away over time. Am trying Tenacious Tape Flex patches on some 1/2"" tears. Will praise them if they work over time. The manufacturer should be ashamed that they show tub replacements as always ""out of stock"" and don't answer repeated queries about when they can supply.

I preferred it to this black Saluspa because 1) it didn't have the air hose on the side and 2) had a better drain with a tube going to the outside edge of the spa.  My first spa got heavy use and the vinyl finally wore out after about three years.  I could have made it last longer but for the price I was fine with completely replacing it.  The pump was going just fine even after all that use.  So I got this one and after six months the pump started to get loud.  I called Bestway and within days had a new pump.  We'll see how this one lasts.  Overall I'm very happy with these inflatable spas.  We live in a moderate climate: not Minneapolis, but not Phoenix.  During the winter months (average lows in the 20's) I'll run it 10-12 hours to get it to approximately 103 degrees.  In the summer (average highs in the mid 90's), I'll run it just an hour or two to make approximately 99 degrees.

My German Shepard has jumped on it a few times while it was covered and there was no impact or damage, nor did it collapse or even lose air.The bubbles are very strong. I thought they were comparable to the jets of a hot tub. It also is a nice soaking tub.Very low maintenance. I use non-chlorine products 2 to 3 times a week and change the filters every couple of weeks depending on use.I like that it has no seats because it's more comfortable to keep your legs stretched out and the bottom of it has a nice comfy cushion.The temperature of 104 is sufficient for most of the year but I live in a very warm climate.The cons:  It was too cold to use it in the winter once it got below 40 degrees, since the heater doesn't stay on while the bubbles are on. The water would lose it's temperature after about 20 min and drop to around 97-100. If you only want to stay in it for short periods of time, I guess it would be ok.The setup was a little more difficult than expected. The big hub with the control panel needs something placed under it because it didn't fit flat onto the ground. It's a little heavy so I wasn't able to connect it by myself and my boyfriend had to do it for me. When we set it up in the winter, it took about 24 hours to get to max temperature.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The Miami size is perfect for one or two people.

Since it is summer, I'm sure it may help with getting the temp up, from the first day it took 17 hours to get the temp to 104 & thereafter after using it, it would take but a few hours to get it at that temp. Once I put the bubbles on the temp went down 3 or 4 degrees - if I didn't use it, the temp pretty much stayed at or near 104. Very good engineering - and I think the top cover does a great job insulating it. I paid $257 & if this stays good for a year, I won't mind paying that each year for a new one since a ""normal"" size unit runs in the thousands plus factor in the cost of chemicals, heating.

I like to use it in the morning. One morning the outside temperature was 19 degrees and the spa was at 103. The thermostat is a little temperamental. I set it at 102 but it often heats to 103 or 104. The bubbles will cool it down pretty fast. Without running the bubbles it holds a comfortable temperature for 30 minutes to an hour depending on ambient temperature. I added pipe insulation to the clear filter return tube that runs outside the spa. That is key in below 40 degree temperatures. The heater will shut itself off if you don't use it for 3 days, which is not ideal because I travel and like it to be hot. It does have a timer feature so the morning I leave I can set the heater to come on in 48 hours and run for 24 hours, so the water doesn't get so cold before I get home. For the money paid for this it has been well worth it. It is not going to give you a hydro massage but it works well and keeps the water hot.

I’m writing this from inside the hot tub, in my back yard in Providence, RI, in light snow and a temp of 34F - it’s a solid 100F in here (which is what I have it set at because I don’t like really hot water). I set it up a week ago in about 37-38F weather, with it heating up the following day to about 45F...it’s been in the range of 28-40 every day/night since then. When I was setting it up, I added some hot water using a bucket,  but honestly that accounted for maybe 10% with the rest coming from the cold hose water. I did add some extra insulation - the silver almost bubble wrap looking kind around the exterior of the tub and pump. I also put it on top of concrete, plastic bergo tiles, a thick tarp, and then 1.5” foam insulation boards...I also made an extra layer out of the foam insulation boards for the top (placed between the blow up and snap layers). I then have a heavy tarp draped on top of it. It took less than 24hrs to heat up to the set temperature. I’ve used it 6 of the last 7 nights, wide open for 30-75 mins...I’ve never had to get out because it was cold. I can’t yet speak to what my electric bill is gonna look like, and I don’t know what will happen if we get a real cold streak (gut is maybe cooler than I want to use, but no damage from freezing), but so far this seems like it’s a totally viable winter option, even in the cold. I got the insulation ideas from YouTube - there are lots of even fancier ideas too. The supplies cost me about $125. Overall - I’m stoked about this. I suspect I’ll eventually upgrade to a real one to cut down on waste, but this is perfect for the time being and to ensure I’ll actually use it!","Awesome, even in NE winter",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful,,4670489,15,5,Public

Can't get a replacement and apparently the warranty was up a couple months ago. Very sad. Don't want to pay$200 for a liner plus shipping..in other words may as well buy another..

It runs on 110 so you can plug it into a regular household outlet without needing an electrician to hard wire it in. You can drain it easily and 1 person can move it to anywhere in the house or yard you want it as long as you have an outlet. It also has a very thick cushioned interior to sit or lay on which is way more comfy when compared to most other hot tubs that have hard seats and bottoms.

Didn't last long, but it was fun to have in our back deck for as long as it lasted. Water does heat up to 104 degrees, and jets are as nice as can be expected for this type of hot tub.No the bad (the terrible). Exactly 10 months of moderate use after the purchase date, the hot tub started losing air, to the point of not being able to hold it for a day. Keep in mind, my wife and I followed the maintenance instructions highlighted in the service manual to a ""T"". With confidence I called Bestway Usa knowing that they'd probably would take care of the problem, given that there was a 1 year warranty on it, and given that I didn't do any damage to the hot tub, but rather it stopped working the way it was supposed to on its own.During the first conversation, they told me I had a 1 year warranty on it, however the ""liner"" of the hot tub only has 6 moths. That meant that they wouldn't do anything  to help me. So first they send me a new valve (only because I asked for one, otherwise they were ready to sell me a new product). Valve didn't work, my hot tub was still deflating.During second phone call, I tell them new valve doesn't fix the issue. They offer me the option of buying a new liner, since I already had a pump. The cost with shipping was already about 65% of the total I paid for the hot tub to begin with, brand new. But I did enjoy having it while it worked, so I decided to give it another shot, and bought the new liner. They did tell me that they were out of stock of my specific liner, but that they had a compatible version which would fit all my other parts.So I receive the new liner (this time a Coleman instead of a MiamiSpa), and everything works, except it is definitely and noticeably smaller than the first one I had. I could notice is by putting the original lid the first one came with, and it wouldn't fit.Which takes me to my last and final phone call. Even after maintaining the product as instructed, even after calling the manufacturer Best Way within less than 1 year of use, and even after selling me a considerably different product than the one I called them about (which they said was the same size), all I got was a customer service agent (who was trying her best to be nice), but that ultimately hung up on me after I requested to speak to a manager.I hope my experience helps you make a decision on whether you'd like to spend over $300 on this product. If you just want to have fun for a few months with it, for that price, then buy it. But I was the most disappointed with the company's costumer service, who took advantage of my situation to make more money out of me, and wasn't concerned with solving my problem.",Deflated after < 1 yr of purchase.

They are all awesome, and I highly recommend them. The first one I got was the Coleman layzspa, and comparing the Coleman and the Miami, I would say there seems to be more reinforcement in the walls of the Coleman one. It is quite a bit more sturdy. That's not to say the Miami isn't great, it is. So great, we bought one as a gift for an employee and his wife. They are filling it now. I have no doubt they will love it.I think the Coleman and the Palm Springs may be a closer comparison, and when I buy a fourth one, I think I will buy the Palm Springs. I think it, like the Coleman, prolly has more water capacity, and therefore requires more reinforcement on the side walls, making it seem less like an inflatable hot tub. I would pick the palm springs over the Coleman only because of the color. Colman green is great when I'm camping, but I'll keep it on my laterns and stoves rather than a somewhat permenant fixture in my backyard. I have yet to have any kind of problems with any of my hot tubs. As with any outdoor fixture, after a while they get dirty and sun faded, and the beauty of these is that when that happens, I can just get a new one, instead of having an eyesore in my backyard.

Thought it had to be an infomercial or some gimmick. Turns out, this baby is worth every expletive dollar. Time tested, it pays for itself with pleasure. Few items are you ever actually proud of buying. This is one.I purchased this for my family after finishing a college degree that really exhausted us to the limit. I wanted something that was relaxing and rewarding for all of us. I didn't have a lot of cash after being buried in student debt, barely a 3 day vacation saved, and I wanted something that would last. Toys and trips, everything we buy these days seems to get forgotten as we find new interests. Our house had a giant retractable awning that also works particularly good over this tub.So I researched, talked it over with the wife, and ordered it. This thing was easy to unpack and get working. Compared to our 30"" deep Intex pool it was a huge relief. Took a while to heat up but that was expected. My only complaint, and really my only one, is that somewhere in the tub styrofoam was left when it was filled. I did not have any issues getting it unpacked so am not sure where it came from. Had weeks of little particles floating around, but it is no longer an issue at all.The heat warm off cycle is a bit tricky to get at first, if you won't take anything less than 104 degrees, which it'll easily max out at (and is as hot as I would ever want) you've got to check on it like a pet. Unlock the panel, bump up the temp, etc. I understand this is important because there are days I go without wanting to use it.Keeping it clean is a cinch and quite easy once you've done it a few times. My recommendation is skip the ridiculous cleaning tools and pick up a $1 pool squirting toy thing. I got one from our Dollar store during summer. It does a fine job picking up gravel and other particles. It also doubles as a weapon.Have not yet packed it away for the season, but I imagine it will not be very difficult with the drainage plug. I will be sad that day.So.... Worth it? Yup.","Before this hot tub, I could not imagine more value for my money",Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful,,11464021,26,4,Public

This spa is absolutely amazing.  When we sit in it, the water covers my shoulders with wonderful warmth. The bubbles are stronger than I expected - they aren't hard core jets but they are more than adequate. We started with this model as a Black Friday purchase since we'd never seen a spa of this portable style ""live"" so we wanted to not spend too much in case it was a bust.  My husband had it assembled and filling with water within 15 minutes - super simple to assemble. It is very light to carry without water - pretty much could be moved by anyone. Since we've had it, living in he northwest, it has weathered record rainfall, snow, excessive wind and now below freezing temps.  Although it isn't recommended for temperatures such as the 20's and 30's, with a bit of extra insulation it seems to be doing fine.  It doesn't look super spacious when looking at it as it's filling, However, when sitting in it, it's very roomy. Spacious for tow of us, would be fine with three and I think four would be better during hot weather when enjoying a summer evening and not needing to have complete submersion.  We are appreciate that it can use the 110 and doesn't need the 220. We have a 220 but it's not where we'd want to put the tub.

It takes about a day and a half to get to temp but that depends on the ambient temp changes.  I used it all the time and felt it was the best purchase of my life.  Just like any pool product you must keep up with chemical levels and cleaning, change the filters and when storing, make sure it’s fully dried out and kept sealed so that bugs don’t work their way into the channels and cause clogs.  If outdoor temp drops below 50 degrees for extended periods then store it for the season because the motor just can’t keep up with the heating.  I ended up having to give it away when I moved south because I was moving into an apartment and missed it so much I just bought a new one.

It sets up just as easily as the description say it will. It took about 3 minutes to inflate the tube with the built in compressor and then another 90 secs or so to inflate the inflatable part of the two piece cover. Then attaching the pump to the side of the tub was quick (Hint: start with the ""A"" connection it will make the others line up and seat easier).  Then Fill With Water.  It’s only a couple hundred gallons so that won’t take long with your standard hose connection.  I think this whole process took about 30 minutes.  I Tested for Chlorine at this point to which my city has very little so I add some (Hint: Use Chlorine or Bromine that is specifically compounded for Low Volume Bodies of water or Spas). Then I Started the Heater and Filter Pump set it to 104F.  The Rating on the pump is accurate for an environment that doesn't fall below about 50F.  I do see about a 2 degree/hour Rise when I turn on the pump in the morning.  I must admit that I cheated in the initial heating process by removing pots of water from the pool boiling and returning. I was able to gain out 5 degrees per hour by boiling about 4 pot and hour.  I continued off and one till the pool was at about 100F and letting the pool get to the final number.  The Timer Feature is great and allows for small amounts of energy savings but running the tub full time doesn’t cost that much.  I set mine to heat form 14 hours after I get out and on a delay of 10 hours.  That wording will make more sense after you read the manual for the spa.  As of yet I have had no inflation issues with the spa but transfers from hot to cooler and back will cause anything to deflate.  It stays at temperature for at least 30 min when the ambient temp is over 40F.  All in all this is spa cost 10% of a permanent Spa that also has to be professionally installed and still runs at high wattage.

The previous one lasted for almost three years and I figure that's pretty good longevity for an inflatable. Besides I already know that the customer service at Bestway is outstanding. The heater pump took a dump 8 months in with the last tub, still under warranty and they sent out a new pump immediately without hassle.The newly purchased tub is a better design- even easier setup (less components) heats up quicker and seems to hold the heat better too. I did use the top cover material from the old tub to insulate/protect the bottom, so that may be a factor. Also I placed the tub under a covered deck and that way it's not as vulnerable to the elements. The manual says that it's not a good idea to operate the tub in below freezing temperatures but I think having a shelter for it may allow for a little bending of those rules. It just snowed here for the first time this winter; it's been 28°F at night for a week and all seems to be fine. The tub isn't sitting perfectly level either. The cement of the patio is at a slight decline, maybe a couple of inches, but doesn't seem to affect operation or stability.I learned a few good tricks with my 1st tub so apply them to the new one in hopes that I can make it last possibly longer.The filter needs to be taken out and sprayed clean frequently, the more the better. It's important to stay on top of this to insure smooth running/longevity of the heater pump. Avoid getting in the tub with dirty feet or any other risk of adding debris. Have a pool skimmer handy just in case.I really like the little chemical dispenser that adheres to the outflow inside the tub so you dont have to have a floater. I keep a steady supply of 1 bromine tablet cut in half and it keeps the water crystal clear and doesn't smell.Another rule of thumb: its inflatable- therefore important to keep glass, curious animals, children or any sharp objects far away and be gentle getting in/out of the tub. It IS very thick and sturdy but once you have a hole that's when the trouble begins. Even if you can locate and fix the leak it's difficult to keep it fully inflated. The last 6 months of having my last tub my cat suddenly jumped up on the top side to visit me and punctured the most vulnerable part of the vinyl. I was able to fix but as time went on was hand-pump inflating it more and more then just gave up and got a new one.I have been using the new one almost every night for over 2 months now. The ""floor"" is also more attractive, more padded and  more comfortable than the previous. So far, so GREAT!The spa temperature reaches to 104°F and its a perfect thrill to get in every time. The ""jets"" (just bubbles) are fun too, although the temp goes down quickly when they are on. The timer is a really nice feature. I usually sit in the tub around 9pm for about 20 minutes and then when I get out I set the timer for 8 hours. It automatically shuts off early morning and has a chance to ""rest"", the temp goes down to around 93°F, I turn it back on set to 104°F again when I leave for work then when I get home it's ready when I'm ready.Keep in mind that this is NOT a 4 person tub. Two adult lovers snuggling is maybe the limit, but in my opinion it's best to experience solo.All in all it's a good purchase as long as the price threshold doesn't go beyond $500. Selling sites keep fluctuating between $400 and a whopping $900.Considering that you dont pay too much, you have an adequate, low maintenance one to two person spa for minimum $$ per year.

For under $500, it provides a really relaxing experience. The timer works well, but it’s best if you anticipate the weather. Obviously, colder outside air temperature will take longer for the water to warm up. It’s probably not recommended, but we have put in cost of boiling water which helps the temperature rise more quickly. It also means in excess of water so the next time will have to empty out buckets of water. Don’t expect high end temperature feel. I am pretty easily pleased, so 104 is plenty warm for me. If it was offered, I would probably pay a little more for one that went up to 108 or 110°.The set up was pretty easy. They recommend switching out the water fairly often, but so far I have emptied it once and cleaned it really well sense early January. I think switching out the water once every 5-6 weeks with some gentle cleaning and mild chemicals (bromine tablets and ph up/down) is the right frequency with how often we use out tub (3x/week).

It got delivered promptly, within 36 hours. They might want to warn about the weight but I just took everything out of the box and the individual pieces were manageable. Set up is pretty easy AFTER you look for a YouTube video - the pictorial instructions that are included are complete crap. I still have a couple of parts that I have no idea what they do or where they go as they are never shown in the manual other than as an included part, or in the videos I watched. If you think Ikea furniture is difficult, these instructions are not for you. However, once I got everything seemingly in the right place, it turned on nicely and heated up from about 72 degrees for the water temp to 102 within 24 hours. I still need to figure out how to open the filter container - it was shown in one video but I haven’t managed to actually open it that way, so an easier opening mechanism on this would be appreciated. I’m not sure if it unscrews or you just pry it open.Let’s be clear this is more suitable as a hot tub, not a jacuzzi. The bubbles do little more than bubble the water and the air pump feature is so loud that having a conversation with other people might be difficult.","Good value for the cost, more hot tub than jacuzzi",Verified Purchase,,,25913457,30,5,Public

I use the floating frog spa system and I always have good bromine levels with practically no work. The heater and timer function work great and let me tell you, this thing pumps out some bubbles!

Also - the preset temperature control does not mean that the pump will cycle on and off along with the heating element to maintain a constant temperature. In order to maintain 100 degree, say, the pump/filter will stay on 100% of the time, even though the heating element will go off an on as needed. So we notice the constant noise from it. I would just let it turn off and then back on using the timer, but it would go down in temp so fast and then heat back up so slowly that it's not really feasible. I put it on a 1"" cut piece of rigid foam insulation, and cut 2 half-round pieces of rigid foam insulation to sit on the water, under the cover, when not in use. I took an infrared camera to it and can see no heat loss from top with all that but a lot from the sides. Also I plan to put another 2"" of rigid foam insulation under it.All that being said, we like it and are happy with it. We live in Northern California near the coast, and it's been around 50 degrees.

Is this as powerful and as nice as a ‘real’ hot tub? No. However, after 3 months, I have no problems with it. I set it up under the covered part of lanai to keep it out of the elements. I put down garage floor tiles and some bubble wrap underneath it for insulation. At 104* the water almost feels like it’s burning hot and it retains the heat for awhile.

Got this one for $150 less than regular price. Setup was quick and painless. It was about 45 degrees out and the instructions recommend to bring inside and inflate in an environment over 60 degrees. Brought it inside and let it sit for a couple hours to let the plastic warm up. Then inflated it with zero issues. Took 5-10 mins to inflate both the hot tub and cover.After inflation, brought into our garage where we plan to use it for the next couple winter months before moving it outside in the spring. Filled it with our garden hose, which was pretty cold water. Added supplemental hot water from our bath tub as it warned about an error code when filling with too cold of water. Water registered 68 degrees before heating commenced. No issues with any error code. Added bromine tablets to the chemconnect dispenser (no longer a floating device) and started the heat. Took about 18 hours to heat up to 104.Haven't had any issues with it since we set it up 4 days ago. Been checking for leaks but everything looks dry around the outside. It also hasn't turned itself off after 72 hours, which has been widely reported. Not sure if these things (no turn off, no floating chemical dispenser) lead to it being a newer model or what. My family, especially my 7 y/o son, absolutely love it. We go in it every night and it's the highlight of our day. I got some additional chemicals (spa shock oxidizer, clarifier), a scumbug, and skimmer which all work great and should last us a while. So far absolutely love our purchase!

About 25% of the circumference does not produce bubbles, that is a negative.  The big negative, the inflatable tub is cheap thin plastic/vinyl.  The Coleman version is thicker and solid and held up to years of wear, cats walking on it, dogs looking over it when we were in it etc.  This lasted 2 days before the first hole appeared, another hole the next day.  Think of the cheap inflatable rings you use in a pool you can get for $1.00, this is slightly thicker.

I've been debating for a long time whether I should buy one of these or just save up and get a real one.  I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T WAIT ANY LONGER!!!-Packaging: The box came a little beat up, but I can't say who's fault that is.  On the inside, everything was in great condition and was brand new, so I can't fault that.  The kit weighs approximately 60lbs total.-Assembly: It took me about 15 minutes to set it up and start filling it with water.  It comes with everything you need to inflate it and didn't require any tools to put together.  You simply inflate the tub and then inflate the top, then connect the pump/heater unit to the tub.  There are velcro straps around the edges of the lid to keep it on the tub when not in use.-Chemicals: This was my first tub so I was a novice when starting to use the chemicals.  I recommend contacting a local pool or spa supply store for more information in this area.  I shocked the tub to start it up and am using bromine tablets in the floater (in the box with the hot tub)-Use: It's a dream.  It maintains 104 degree temperature during 20-30 minute sessions in the evening when it's 60-70 degrees outside.  I imagine it will cool off a little faster during colder nights, but I think the heater does an excellent job keeping up with use.  The ""Lay-Z-Massage"" system was the biggest surprise to me.  I was expecting some light bubbles, but I was wrong!  The bubbles are strong and create a very nice massaging sensation across the entire spa.  I was very happily impressed with this.-Construction: Its built much like an inflatable pool, but with much more solid construction.  My biggest fear prior to recieving it was air leaking out, but it's just as full now as it was on day one. The pump appears to be solid and well built.-Concerns: None at this point.  Will update if something changes-Summary: I'm upset with myself that I waited so long to buy this.  You can buy 20 of these for the cost of a basic normal hot tub.  If this even holds up for 2 years I would be completely thrilled and will be ready to buy another one!**********************************UPDATE - 8/12/2016**********************************It's been over 2 months since my spa stopped working.  It was under warranty, so I contacted Bestway and asked for service.  They had me cut the power cord off the pump and send them a photo along with some other information.  They told me they had the pump in stock and would send it out right away, but didn't have the liner so I might have to wait for that.  The pump was the major issue anyway so I was thrilled.  I did what they requested 30 minutes after getting off the phone with them. I then waited a month without hearing a word from their service department.  When I called in they apologized and admitted that they had dropped the ball and would send a pump out as well as some complimentary filters for the trouble, unfortunately the pump was no longer in stock.  The representative apologized and told me they would have some new pumps in soon so I should check back in 2 weeks.  That was over a month ago.  Called in today and they're still out of pumps.  They refuse to do anything else and according to their phone representative, not a single person at the company knows when the pump will be in stock.  This is the worst warranty service I've ever received.",I can't believe I waited so long to get this!  This is the best money I've spent in a while.

It was easy enough to set up, but you do HAVE to read everything to make sure you do it correctly. It was a bit tricky for us getting the right chemicals as we had never done this before. There isn't really a good explanation in the manual about what you need. We went to a pool store and told them what we bought and they made suggestions of the chemicals we need. It's a perfect size for 2 people, or even 3. The bubbles are great, tons of them, and it feels wonderful. It's quite noisy with all of the bubbles going on, but not a big deal to us. The only thing I don't like is there aren't any jets between the 2 filters inside of it, and so if someone sits there, they don't get the benefits of it, that's why it's better for 2 people if you want the bubble massage.  Not sure why they didn't put bubble holes in that area, but there must be a reason. I would recommend it.

This is a great hot tub. It comes in a large awkward box that is best handled by 2 people. Setup takes probably 20 minutes, then another 20 minutes or so to fill with a garden hose. It takes about 20-24 hours to heat from 60 degrees to the max temp of 104. You can fit 3 people it it comfortably, 4 is a squeeze. The tub is very comfortable, I actually find it more comfortable than a conventional hot tub since the sides and floor are soft. The massaging air feature is better than I expected, but is slightly loud, but no louder than the jets of a conventional hot tub. The tub is insulated quite well. I have it sitting right on some concrete on the ground, and due to the padded floor insulation the temperature will only drop about 20-25 degrees in a 24 hour period with the tub off in ~50 degree ambient temperatures, and while I'm using it, if I get in when the temp is 104, it will still be at ~100 an hour and a half later. The temp will drop much faster if you use the massaging air.The filtration system works well, but be sure to buy some extra filters with the tub, as they only last a week or two.   Coleman Lay-Z Spa Replacement Cartridges (12)          Also be sure to buy a good test kit.   Poolmaster 22260 5-Way Test Kit with Case - Basic Collection           All I use is muriatic acid, unscented bleach, and a little baking soda and you're good to go.

Hot tub works great. There were a few questions I had before buying it. I searched Amazon reviews and couldn't find the answer. I thought I would post them below.Q: How much electricity does this hot tub use.A: about 12.5 Kilowatts per day that is leaving it at 102 degrees and using it 30 min a day indoors. I just got my electric bill and only saw about a $15 increase. The Power usage is about 1300 watts when heating, 600 Watts for blower.Q: Is the Air cold that is being use to make the jets run?A: Yes but you only notice it when you put your Hands right above the jet's it's cold. At 102 degrees I can use it for 30 min and it drops to about 99. Works great for me.Q: What chemicals do I use?A: I bought chlorine granules on Amazon. Use about 1/2 tablespoon every 3 days. I did buy Spa Down as my water has a High PH. That seems to be working. Also living in MN our water has lots of dissolved minerals in it. I did use Soft Water as we have so much iron in our water and my Alkalinity level is high but I have not had a problem with it. I still may take my water to a spa dealer to have it tested.Couple of things to note:-It does loose air when tub is inflated for a few weeks. I didn't need to add air as the water keeps it up. It was not a problem. Just the sides get a little soft.-The pump will not work if water is too cold. I just filled my tub after being gone for a few weeks. Since it is now -0 in MN our water coming from the city was at 46 degrees. The pump would error out. I had to wait for the water to warm up to room temp then the pump worked fine. The first time I filled it in Oct. the pump worked fine and the water was about about 56 degrees. Just so you know if you get an error.- Temp fluctuation. Remember the heater will not work when the jet's are on. Also it has a 4 degree temp swing. For example if you set it to 102 the temp could be between 100-104. So if you really want 104 you may need to go look at the spa a few hours before you use it and turn off the heater and back on to kick in the heat.I love this spa! It has a few issues.

Everyone that sees it wants one. I'll list below my pros and cons but overall for the money this little hot tub is rad!Pros: easy to install / operate. Bigger than expected. 2 people under 6' fit very comfortably. 4 people would work as well but probably not much room to stretch out. The blower/bubble massage is pretty awesome. Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of jets in most hot tubs anyway; they make me itchy so the bubble massage is great for me. Looks freakin sexy for an inflatable hot tub. Material quality is better than expected. Packaging was well put together and was lighter than expected. About 50lbs.Cons: hose and line connectors seem a little flimsy. Make sure to tighten everything ""hand-tight"" I can see someone easily over wrenching and breaking a connector. 72hr auto-off timer is a slight annoyance. This is a bit nit-picky but the cover is also inflated and it actually floats on top of the water which keeps my floater from moving too much when the top is on. Lastly, it says that it should be kept out of temps below 40°F and here in the midwest that's precisely why/when I wanted a damn hot tub so I will be taking a gamble on what temps this badboy can handle.I'm super happy with this purchase and it seems as if I'm not the only one.Also- I built a level deck and pergola above it for protection since it will be outside.",Badass little hot tub!,Verified Purchase,82 people found this helpful,,3724707,127,59,Public

I take mine to the campgrounds at the park. Plan ahead because it takes about 20 hours to heat water to 104 degree and when your done the water has to drain somewhere. what it does not do is force water for jets. Instead it forces air to create a bubbling action in the water which i like better. The air is not heated and will be noticed only if you sit directly against the tiny ports. If you use the bubbles for to long the water heater can't keep up and the temp slowly drops. if this happens just turn the bubbles off for a while or get out because you have probably been in for to long anyway.If you have a few $grand$ and a place to permanently install a tub this might not be for you, but if like me, you work hard to stretch a dollar, rent a home and love a cold beer in the hot tub after work then you're going to love this thing.",... paid about $300 US dollars for mine and absolutely love it.

We had a little hiccup in the beginning but it was resolved quickly and professionally by best way. I have read other reviews were people say it was a pain to get a part replaced but we had zero issues in that department. After 3 days of use, we kept getting the 02 and 06 error codes and we could not for the life of us figure out why. We thought we had done everything right, so we called the company and they sent us a new filtration system without a problem. We got the new one within 3 days!After replacing the system, we discovered we had not cleaned out or changed the filters. THIS IS A BIG DEAL! If you are going to buy this product, get extra filters immediately to have on hand! The manual tells you to clean them every day and change them every three days. We have gotten away with cleaning them every other day and changing them every 2-3 weeks (depending on how often we use it). Once we started being diligent about this, we didn't get anymore error codes. We kind of felt bad that we had the company replace the whole filtration unit because of our error.

The first chore was hooking up a power usage device.  It cost approximately 11 cents/hr to heat the water. .  The outdoor temperature is currently 57 and so is the outer sidewall.  The water was 100 degrees when the heater was turned off.  During the following 6 hours, with the air temp reaching 50 degrees, the heat loss was a mere 5 degrees or approximately 1 degree per hour.  I can accept losing 5 cents/hr heat loss, based on 10 cents/hr to increase the water temp two degrees.  With an air temp of 51 the outer sidewall was 54.  I was hoping  to keep the outer sidewall within a few degrees of the air temp.  Yes, the pump is too noisy but I have no intentions of utilizing that ""water cooler"".  There are several methods to create a genuine water jet inside the tub.  Photos illustrate a 4 hour process to substantially lessen heat loss.  The top cover now boasts three additional layers;  floating blue bubble blanket, double layer of R1 (1/4"" foam) and 2"" of standard styro. The white styro inserts flush with the top of the tub like a tight lid.  The inflatable top rests on a support (white trellis) which spans the top of the sidewalls.  The side wall wrap is two layers of blue bubble insulation  with a single panel  1/4"" foam sandwiched in between.  Strongly suggest users also enhance the floor padding with memory foam, carpet padding,  convoluted mattress pads or anything you might have available.  There is no need to dwell on the shortcomings of customer service given the fact many reviews address that issue.  The tub only shows one band securing the sidewall wrap.  Several more support bands were added afterwards.  I prefer granular chlorine to tablets.  A few tablespoons lasted two weeks.The manual, DVD, or parts list did not reference the 5 foot clear hose that came with the unit.  The purpose became obvious after the unit was leaking water through the second filter housing. The hose connects the filter to the main housing intake at the Y connection.

You will also need a propane tank, like the ones you would see on a BBQ grillIt would take about 2 to 3 hours to heat to 104F and cost me only about $15 in propane, much more economical!you just have to plan a few hours ahead.Update: The pump: B00NJXE9PW finally gave out.

Waited a little over a month to write out this review..THE BAD:The Lid is shotty at best.First Few weeks the water will smell like plastic!If you are over 6' tall this just barely works to get yourself completely submerged.The LCD ""controller"" has some stupid quirks that are annoying, and if anyone has a fix for this let me know!!1. It will only stay on for 3 days if you don't touch it.2. It doesnt always keep the spa at 104F (max temp) so you need to go check on it about an hour or so prior to when you want to use it and if need be unlock the LCD and put the spa back into HEAT mode (which can be annoying for obvious reasons)3. The LCD will lock itself automatically after 4 minutesThe other thing I don't like is how loud this thing is when you put the bubbles on, it literally sounds as loud as a shop vac! Also another thing about the bubbles is they drastically decrease the temp and the way this unit works you cannot have bubbles and heating simultaneously.THE GOOD:If you time it right and get in there when its actually at 104F it feels exactly the same as a hot tub, it stays hot (if in warming mode, not on bubbles mode) Oddly enough the thing I was most skeptical about was the bubbles, but they work really well. Yes they are not the same as jets on a hot tub, but for 2500$ cheaper its a decent tradeoff.The construction of the tub itself is solid, the pump/heating/bubbles unit doesn't leak at all! Make sure you thread all the nuts on correctly!  and the unit itself is not too loud during normal heading/filtration mode. I use tub in my basement because the noise from the bubbles is loud and don't want to have it outside.So there is definitely some things I would change if I could to improve it, I would make it be able to get just a little hotter, and have more control with the LCD so you could use it with less fuss but overall its a solid hot tub for waaaay cheaper than a real one and lot less of the hassle associated with a typical hot tub!","cheaper alternative to traditional hot tubs, but far from perfect",Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful,,13138036,54,40,Public

After being put on hold about 10 times I was told to send pictures in of the damaged parts.  One of the parts was the air inflated top cover, it has a slow leak, need to add air every few days to keep it firm.  They said they would only replace it if I destroy it by cutting a hole in it.  All this before they would send a replacement part, and not sure when those would arive.  I told them i would be happy to cut it up after the replacement but they will not do that.  They want me to destroy the cover, so that rain and junk can get into the pool.
