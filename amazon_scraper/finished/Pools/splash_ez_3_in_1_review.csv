I am not a happy camper as this was the only gift I sent...  The kid is bummed.... Update! They were wonderful about sending a working pool but didn't have the exact same one in stock. The pool they sent works fine, other than the coupler which doesn't work on any of them, it had to be hooked directly to the pool itself.

They didn't like it at all. This would only be good for a person who has hot/cold water faucet outside to hook the hose up to so that the water temperature could be adjusted. I let the splash pad dry out for over 24 hours and then stored it for about 5 days when we used it again on a day that was over 100 degrees. Same thing, the water was cold and the kids didn't like it, even in that much heat. The real problem was that black mold had built up inside and it was shooting out of the holes as the water pushed it through. Black chunks were floating in the water in the splash pad and getting on the kids' skin, too. There isn't a good way to dry the pad out, since the water is always accumulating in some place around the outer ring. I really wanted to return this item, but once I had returned home from the trip we were on where we took the pad with us, over 1 month had already passed.

So this review is based on this use. I will add on to the review, if the status of the product changes.The product came neatly packed. There was no vinyl repair kit with it, so I assume if something happens, it cannot be repaired. We connected the splash pad to our coil hose, which made the pad to continuously try to twist. Once filled with water, the pad settled. I also put the hose in a place that would hold it without twisting much, so it wouldn't affect the splash pad.It took forever and a day to fill. We connected the hose to the kitchen sink. We do not have an outside water faucet. The water pressure *seemed appropriate*. In goes the water. When it finally filled, there wasnt enough water pressure to make the splash pad sprinklers higher than a couple of inches tall. But that was perfect. My child doesnt like shower like things, so the sprinklers here were fantastically adequate. The bottom of the pad filled with water, enough for some rubber duckies to float around, and get some cups to play and stuff. My child enjoyed this splash pad very much.We had it set on grass. I would say that is the perfect place for it. Concrete might be too hard.To empty it, it was hard to disconnect the valve from the hose, but it finally came off. It took a few minutes to drain it fully.  We hung the pad on a tall, sunny place.2 days later, there was still water in it, dripping from the valve. I dont know how to fully drain it, and I hope it doesnt cause any mold issues, but I will find out soon.Overall, my child enjoyed the time spent in this splash pad, and it was easy to use. I'd say to watch for that water pressure.Update: we have used this a few more times. I have it connected to the sink still, so the water pressure is low, but it has been a nice product. My child enjoys the time in the water, and that is a win. If it breaks after this, I wouldn't make it a negative, because it has been used a few times and it has taken a lot of jumping and walking on it (not on the outer ring, we try and stay off of that). I think it is a great item.",Enjoyable product,Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful,350233,85,95,Public

I wanted a shallow pool for him to get used to water and splash around in.I thought this was an inflatable pool meaning inflate with air then fill with water. This is actually inflated with water. That is both a plus and a minus. It’s a good thing because it can’t pop and if it tears it matters less because it doesn’t need to be air tight. But its also not as good because it means in need to use water from the hose all the time. Water has to be running into it at all times or it “deflates”. Water fills the base through the little holes in the tube that create its water feature. This again is a con for me because I wanted to fill it up with water let it sit in the sun most of the morning so the water would be warm for the baby, but because it requires constant water, the water does not warm up as much. So its not as good for young children that are more temperature sensitive.I did end up figuring out the minimum water setting to keep it inflated and still allow the water inside to warm up some.My baby enjoys going splash-splash in it. Right now he just sits in the pool, but each summer as he gets bigger will -play more and can increase the water pressure to use the water feature.For a less than 1yr old baby not a great choice.

So both ages can play safety and enjoy splashing and sensory play outdoors.Use ONLY with 100% adult supervision, infants and toddlers can drown in less than a couple of inches of water. There was a bit of pooling with the water hose continuously flowing, which was fine for the toddlers but not recommended for the infants. The water hose will have to be turned off at some point and/or start at a lower pressure from the beginning. I did not...I started both at the highest pressure and filled them up with gusto.lolOverall, wonderful fun product that we will enjoy this summer!The images are taken when I tested them, to see how they worked closer to the water hose bit.

I've raised my review from 2 stars to reflect this.  We haven't had the weather to set up the SplashEZ again, but will try again once the weather warms up (presumably next year).The replacement appears to be the same unit, so not sure the design flaw is fixed. We will have to think carefully about where to place this when in use to avoid mud and slipping.  Maybe we can gerry-rig something around the pool to hold the water in so we can turn the hose off...Purchased this for our grandkids to enjoy over a hot weekend.  It was easy to set up and worked great ... until the wading pool was full.  It's design is flawed.  You have to keep the water flowing from the hose to make it work. First the hose fills the rim and then it shoots up the sprinklers.  If you turn the hose off, the rim collapses and the water escapes from the wading pool.  So the area around it becomes saturated with water, making it slippery and muddy, and the water inside the pool never warmed up in the sun.Overall, the boys had fun running through it, but it didn't work for the ""littles"" who aren't walking yet.  A sprinkler  and a wading pool would probably have made more sense for us (and better for our lawn).",GREAT customer service!

Given that the sprinklers are the feature, and kids will tend to want to go in and out of them, the bottom of the pool is way too slippery. I really don't recommend use by the very young unless you're willing to hold their hands whenever they want to stand up and walk in and out. Certainly they'll slip if they run. Older children may do okay and may actually enjoy sliding around but there are better alternatives for that type of water fun.Construction is a bit strange -- the hose attaches on the inside of the pool rather than the outside, which leaves a weird crimp on one side and the hose at an odd angle -- which leads to tears when the hose scrapes the inside.

Our 4 year old loved the SplashEZ as well, and it was fun for the two kids to play together and then run around on the lawn.  Full disclosure here: since this hooks up directly to your hose, the water temp is only as cold/warm as your hose water is...so yeah, most likely the water will be cold.  But overall, this was a great purchase.  it was super easy to put together, and it is portable, so can move wherever your hose can move to. You get great pressure from the sprinklers and actually don't even need to turn the hose pressure on all the way to get the max height.  The height of the sprinklers is also easily adjustable, so you can make it shorter for the little kids, and taller for the bigger ones.  Oh, and our dog loved it as well!

Maybe end of May. We had the pad 2 weeks before taking it out of the box and setting it up. My daughter managed to only use it a handful Of times before it popped a HUGE hole in the side where the water came rushing out! It was within the return period and I initiated a return. I then decided to post a review (listed below).A few days after posting my review but before the replacement pad arrived I received a message from the seller indicating they would send a pad to replace the first one if I would update /adjust my initial review. I assumed this was just part of the return I had already initiated. They also informed me to be sure and not turn the water pressure up too high. That if you turn it down once there is water shooting out of the holes it’s best to lower the pressure to prevent the seams from busting (which is exactly how we made sure to use the future pads).Now, this actually resulted in us ending up with 2 replacement pads vs just one. I guess it ended up being a replacement from the seller as well as the exchange for the busted pad through amazon. So, this current updated review is right at 3 months after having gotten the FIRST pad!The 2nd pad, after using it only 3-4x also developed a hole right in the seam. Now I initially blamed this on my daughter trying to drag too many things into the pad with her (like a plastic chair or rocks from our yard 🤦🏻‍♀️).So we moved onto the 3rd replacement pad. Now, by this point we also had gotten a slide/slip n slide type device that she could also play on so the splash pad didn’t get used as often. I honestly cannot remember the last time it was used until today.I turned the spigot/hose by 2 full turns to begin to fill and once there was water coming out of the holes I adjusted the water to a lower pressure. So she was out there MAYBE 10 minutes, not even that long actually, long enough for me to have changed her into a water diaper and put sunscreen on her, give her some water toys, and when I walked back over I saw a stream of water spraying from the seam. Now, this is significantly smaller than the other 2 holes but it’s obvious this pad isn’t something that lasts. 😫I put a piece of packing tape over it (it’s all I had) so that she could at least play in it this time.Now I know it only costs $20 and that’s a nice feature but I WISH it would last longer. I would be happy to pay more for something that I knew would last. Especially when it is so unbelievably hot in the summer and she wants to be outside and it is only 1 of 2 outdoor toys she really has and the only way she can even be outside for relatively moderate amounts of time. When I can barely use it for 5-10 minutes it really makes it a very disappointing purchase. I did not know how to message the seller from amazon to address this and since it is outside the return window there isn’t anything that amazon is going to do about it.Updated review from below- June-July?The seal did bust but this was due to us turning the water too high. Gradually fill tube and turn down the pressure to prevent it from busting!#1 review: June.We got this maybe 2 weeks ago and set it up last week. My daughter loves being able to run through the water and slips and splashes in the water that pools in the bottom. She was outside w it just now and I looked over and saw water shooting out the side in a much different angle than the sprinkler normally sprays and as I got over to the side to check it the seam burst and all the water flowed out. Initiated a return for a replacement so i guess we’ll see how that one holds up.",Seal busted BUT now believe it was due to the water pressure being too high,Verified Purchase,,3849006,14,9,Public

Extremely polite & professional for starters.  She then went above and beyond to replace our splash pad at no charge!!  Which turned out to be a much better product than the one we received the first time. Honestly, I'm chalking that first one up to a faulty product, which happens from time to time, we understood that.  And we believe Anne took our first review very seriously but also helpful as a small business owner.  This splash pad works WONDERFULLY!  It is damn near perfect to the advertised pictures and videos, albeit with one or 2 holes not shooting correctly, but we'll take it as an overwhelming improvement & guess what, nothing is going to be 100% perfect.  But this second product is a close perfect. And our daughters absolutely love it!!  I had to remove the defected product video to share the new video but believe me, it is an improvement beyond 100%!!Previous Review - June 2, 2020We've had this for a total of 1 hour. Our biggest gripe are the hole spray patterns. While the product pictures indicate water flowing up and inward, ours is quite the opposite.  Most shoot water straight up, sideways or outwards.  I understand there are some manufacturing defects that happen but the video clearly shows it's not just a few holes that do it.  Water pressure was ok once we played musical hoses.  I recommend using a shorter hose as the water pressure is much better compared to a longer one.  Our 75' hose only had water coming out to knee level on a 5'7"" adult.  The 25' hose had it coming out at waist level on the same adult.  Had the hose length not changed that, we would've given 2 stars.
