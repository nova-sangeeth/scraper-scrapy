Let me begin by helping with a few things about how to set this up to work with coleman pools. I have 2 outlets that come out of pool to the pump and 1 going into the pool.  On one of the out to pump you need to take the strainer grey piece out. It has 2 screws unscrew both and then the strainer piece will unscrew, then you can screw the blue end of the intex strainer onto the outlet. Second when you screw the intex strainer onto the pool frame, you need to screward kit onto the vinyl part of the  frame, not the frame itself. Also you need the peg horizontal and screw each one a little at a time, one peg and then the other until it is tight. I need to do a little more fine tuning, but with some help of other's pictures I was able to figure it out. I didn't have to shut one of the inlets off for now to make sure it was working. I live in west texas and have not bought another filter yet as ours still works, but i'm sure we will replace. Our pool always has lots of bugs which keep me very busy cleaning the pool instead of enjoying the pool. I look forward to not having to vacuum as often, although we still have a lot of dirt here.

I have a 3000 gallon Intex 16'x8'x42"" Rectangular Prism Frame Pool and a 2100gph Intex Sand Filter. I was vacuuming, filtering, and skimming with my net constantly and still my water was cloudy despite having good numbers all around. There was always a film of dust, and sunscreen sludge on the surface that no amount of filtering or skimming could remove. Swarms of gnats so small that the skim net couldn't retain them would litter the surface. When I mow the lawn, mountains of dust and tiny clippings would settle over the whole pool and the skimmer could do nothing. I'd have to wait for everything to sink and then vacuum. I would cringe when I mowed the lawn. I would cringe when the kids went in with sunscreen on. I would cringe when I saw the gnats swarming in the evenings. And then I bought the Intex Deluxe Wall Mount Surface Skimmer.I was skeptical. It just didn't look all that effective or reliable. When I opened the box, it was bigger than I expected. Installation was incredibly easy and quick. Within half an hour, the surface sludge was gone and before the day was over, my water was sparkling! I'd be remiss if I didn't say that a bit of care and thought goes into using the skimmer effectively. For starters, with my 2100gph pump, I have to install the white restrictor cap over my second outflow port in order to generate enough suction to operate the skimmer. The skimmer works best when blue sleeve floats about 2 to 3 inches above the white base cylinder that the hose attaches to. You get your best performance in calm water. I've left it in while the kids were swimming and it has been fine. But if the water gets too turbulent, you the sleeve could come out or, worse yet, bottom out and you could suck air into your lines. I also have an air leak at my restricted outflow port that causes air to slowly get sucked in to the line. Because of this, I have to shut the pump off for a few seconds every couple of hours to allow the air to escape back up the line. This may not be your experience, but it is something to watch out for.I frequently skim the layer of sludge off of the surface of the skimmer using a name brand paper towel. If you get too much sludge/oil buildup in the skimmer, it will actually float back up out of the skimmer. When I am finished using the skimmer, I detach the hose from the outflow port and I cover the end of the hose with a (you guessed it) name brand paper towel that has been folded in half. I then detach the skimmer and lift it slowly out of the water. The paper towel filters the water as it runs out of the hose and prevents small debris and sludge from flowing out into the pool.I am obsessed with keeping my pool clean and I was fighting a losing battle until I purchased the Intex Deluxe Wall Mount Surface Skimmer. Now I can't wipe the smile off of my face as I watch it devour mountains of bugs and sunscreen sludge.",THE best $20 I ever spent.

One problem with this pool I bought is this is my first pool in 3 years that doesn't have a built in side skimmer. Well I never realized how fast is gets dirty and how hard and long it actually takes to clean it.In less than a week that I've had my pool up its already filled with junk and a variety of bugs. And living in New Mexico right next to 3 big cotton wood trees doesn't help.So when I was looking on Amazon for a new filter/pump for the pool I saw this for only $15 a jumped on it.It's extremely easy to setup, takes less than 5 minutes, and doesn't need any extra tools to set it up.It hooked onto the metal frame just fine, but I did notice one thing, it seems uneven (horizontally with the water) so one side of the skimmer isn't bringing in water (basically half of the skimmer isn't skimming). It took me about 5 minutes to get it even and to evenly skim the water.It cleaned up the top of the water of the pool in about 15 minutes. So that was pretty nice and I didn't have to sit there and worry about missing any bugs that would big/sting the little kids.However one big problem does occur, as soon as I got in the pool and started to cause some waves, all the bugs and junk caught floating in the skimmer all came out and went all over the pool. About 5 minutes in the pool the whole assembly came off the water and started to suck air into my water lines.So I've now come to the conclusion and do this, connect the skimmer when no one is in the pool and let it run and come out a few minutes before I know the pump is gonna shut off and clear out the basket. If the pool is dirty before were gonna get in I turn my pump on 10 minutes before I get in with the skimmer attached. Before I get in though I make sure to disconnect the skimmer and its connection to the pump and put it outside the pool. When I get out I just reconnect it again.",Works Great If The Water Is Calm,Size: OSVerified Purchase,394 people found this helpful,126153,705,84,Public

I was worried about how well it worked and kept it’s position and even though I do have some issues with it, I don’t regret the purchase. It does raise and lower automatically with the water lever which was one of my concerns and it does hold on to the blowup edge fairly well which was my other concern. See my video review for more details.2020 update. I used this thing all season last year. I had a few issues where I found that I was getting a lot of air in my leaf filter on the sand filter whenever I had this thing attached. I found out this was because when I had the slimmer attached, I would block off the other inlet and this would create a slow flow and I was taking in air from around the seals. You need to make sure you I’ve enough water flow when this is attached but other than that, this thing makes a huge difference in the cleanliness of the pool.

I have been using this skimmer for a good week & have found it has trapped a HUGE amount of debris/bugs that I would have had to net skim out or would have sunk to the bottom of the pool. IMO- for small money- adding this Intex Wall Mount Skimmer is a ""must have"" for the entry level Intex Pools.I have not encountered the mounting issues other reviewers have stated but I do have it mounted to a soft side Intex pool not a hard side. There is a slight learning curve with the use & set-up but once understood it works great. I recommend watching the online Intex Deluxe Skimmer Video to help with the install, use & understanding of  this skimmer. Intex recommends keeping some air under the outer ridge of the blue floating ring but I needed to ""burp"" or keep all the air out from under the ring ridge- I found doing this allows the floating blue skimmer to be at the perfect water surface height- this greatly improved the performance of the skimmer. **I believe I had to burp the air from under the ring ridge because my filter pump is only 1000-gph**. When using a higher more powerful pump the air under the ridge may be needed to keep the blue floating ring from getting pulled (sucked) to far down below the water surface. I'm confident when I upgrade to the better 2500-gph pump the skimmer will work even better. I also highly recommend using a skimmer basket sock with this skimmer to keep pool debris from reaching the pump filter.

We haven't had that problem, and I think the secret is to make sure it's clamped over the top rail where the vinyl liner goes over it.  Clamping it over the liner helps keep it from slipping.The only reason I knocked off one star is because the upper floating portion does indeed move and shift around a ton when anyone is in the water.  If any junk is trapped on the surface inside the floating ""can"", it will likely get knocked back out into the water.  Also it probably helps to have a skimmer sock attached inside.

First of all, this Skimmer will not work if you have slower filter pump or the standard intex pump you get with your pool. You definitely need something faster. Without this Skimmer, I could put my fingers at the intake holes and feel the water being sucked out the pool. As soon as I install this skimmer, there is absolutely no suction of the water at all. I am sure it is sucking the water through its hose, but it has to be VERY VERY VERYYYYYYYYYYYY slow. Also, the instruction says you have to install the skimmer PERPENDICULAR to the surface of the water. If you do that, it won't simply work as I found out PAINFULLY. For this skimmer to work in your intex pool, you need faster pump and slightly tilt the skimmer. So, some of the pool water will always pour into the skimmer's bowl or basket and thus the stuff floating around on top of the water will slip into the skimmer and stay there until you clean the skimmer.",Okay I guess,Size: OSVerified Purchase,2 people found this helpful,87158,720,209,Public

I installed it per the directions and actually capped one of the two inlet holes for the pump to give me maximum suction at the skimmer.Setup was easy, took about 5 minutes.Here’s my issue though. Unless the pool is being used, the skimmer just kind of sits there. The blue interior float stays above the waters surface so nothing can really have a chance to float into the basket, or just goes around it. Without water agitation it barely moves.When I think of a skimmer I think about the cutouts on the side of pools that allow debris into them with a trap door to keep them from coming back out.  This is really nothing like that.Honestly it was a waste of money for me. Maybe some of you have had success, and I really hate to leave negative feedback for a product, but this one just doesn’t earn it’s keep.I have had good luck with other Intex products, this one however needs to be redesigned.******* updateSo, it seems I judged too soon with this skimmer. After upgrading our pump to the 2800gph model and plugging one of the two return lines at the pool wall, this skimmer is working.I had issues keeping it level so I cut some pool noodles and inserted along the frame where it mounts to the pool. I also had issues with the plugged line sucking air through into the lines for some time, but it cleared itself up. I added a mesh sack or filter saver to the basket to catch dine debris. So far it’s working well.

Too deep or too shallow and it won't work. Rain has filled our pool past the point of skimmer usefulness - it just flat-out doesn't work. 3> The screening basket lets too much small debris through, which then either clogs up inside that difficult nozzle OR gunks up your filter - again, requiring you to remove the blasted nozzle to put the cap on the intake and clean the filter. 4> You are supposed to REMOVE the skimmer when you use the pool???

However the answers to the questions were completely inaccurate. Everything is included except the vacuum plate which is pictured on the box and in all of their reading material. The VAC plate is the clear plate that sits on top of the skimmer to allow the hose to connect to the skimmer and for all of the material that the vacuum picks up to have somewhere to go so that you can easily clean it out. However this kid does not come with the VAC plate as pictured. You can buy it directly on Intex's website for $4.95 but to the best of my knowledge and further research it comes in none of the skimmer kits. It only comes with the Intex pool cleaning kit that is about $100. If you are thinking that you can still use the vacuum by simply hooking it up to one of the suction connections inside the pool you cannot. I unscrewed the screen plate on the inside of the pool and screwed on one of the blue adapters which I have now come to realize is only for adding and accessories such as the skimmer. When you add the blue adapter you will need to take off the white end but due to the fact that inside the suction fitting there is a filter screen everything will just back up there instantly and kill the suction. I have looked everywhere on Amazon to try and find the VAC plate and it is nowhere to be found. You can find others but I am uncertain that they will work with this skimmer. At this point I am debating returning it and getting a commercial on the Lashley work with the pool and comes with a vac plate. But then I'm also debating on just buying the backplate directly from Intex.

There are a lot of issues with it--it sort of works, but only sort of.The hose that it comes with to attach the skimmer to the water inlet is too short, and too rigid, so you can't put the skimmer in the middle of one of the straight tubes that makes up one of the walls. The steel frame is roughly octagonal, made of steel tubes that are connected at the ends, and the liner hangs off those tubes. The liner is roughly round, so at the tube connection points the liner pulls away from the frame a few inches. Unfortunately because of the length and rigidity of the hose, the only spot you can place the skimmer is right near one of those connectors, and as a result the skimmer is at an angle from the wall of the pool and doesn't work as efficiently (or sometimes at all).Also, it tends to float up and start sucking air, so I had to put a baseball-sized river rock in the skimmer basket to keep it from floating up.When it does actually work, it's great. I have a tree over the pool that never fully loses its leaves in the fall, but instead sheds leaves throughout the year, and the skimmer helps keep those off the pool. Also, we have a lot of flying ants and small beetles that wind up drowning in the pool, and they're almost too small for the hand net, but the skimmer collects all of them.

Got the pool full of water again and set this thing back up. I'm still very happy with my choice.

The price was also very nice and cheap enough to try for under $20.I have a intex 18’ round aluminum support frame pool with the intex krystal clear cartridge pool pump 1000gph.Right out of the box the skimmer is pretty much ready to go and will install with probably not much hassle.  I have the duo intake filter hook up and chose the intake closest to the pump.  After an easy instal and hookup with all the supplies parts I was left with a skimmer I figured would show signs of life and instant surface cleaning.  Not at all, it had suction and water flow through the hose but not enough to bring any debris into the catch basin.  Reading the instructions again, there is a restrictor cover for the other intake (instructions really don’t explain this but it’s not rocket science),  so I put that plug on the other intake.  Maybe a slight difference in suction and perhaps a little whirlpool in the strainer but not enough to start bringing debris in.So after a day of this I start reading reviews and begin to think my pump isn’t strong enough.  Maybe true but after some YouTube video browsing I come across a gentleman that figured out a tweak to the skimmer allowing it to work as described.  Some simple duct tape across the bottom vents creating more suction through the hose worked perfectly.  He also used some stick on weights to keep the skimmer ring lower in the water but I found the tape fix to be enough to actually create a vortex that was actually pulling stuff on the surface into the basket.I do recommend one of these for your pool and with just some minor tweaking it should work for keeping floating junk out of the pool. Possibly recommend the skimmer socks as I notice hair and small bits making it through the basket and getting clogged on the intake screen.",Works well with some tweaking.,Size: OSVerified Purchase,,1022711,53,22,Public

Through the years I have had 4 different pools at different homes. The first 2 pools I owned were expensive, high quality pools, and both of these had the typical sidewall mounted skimmer. For my third pool and now fourth pool I decided to save some money by installing the less expensive soft sided type pools. On both of my soft sided pools I have installed these Intex Deluxe Wall Mount Surface Skimmers, and I have been very pleased with the performance of this skimmer. From my own experience, I have found that this Intex wall mount skimmer actually performs better than the typical sidewall mounted type skimmer. With the sidewall skimmer, I usually saw much of the floating debris would float past the skimmer before the skimmer could pull it in. This wall mount skimmer is out in the path of the floating debris and therefore captures the debris more reliably.The instructions clearly state that your pump needs to have at least 800 gallons per hour flow rate for this skimmer to perform correctly. This is not a problem for me because I upgraded to the 14"" sand filter which is rated for 2,800 gallons per hour. I have 2 suction hoses on my pool and the skimmer works great even with no restriction on the second hose. If you have 2 suction hoses and a less powerful pump, you will likely need to plug the second hose. This will not cause a problem because the skimmer allows for quite sufficient water flow to the filter.The skimmer kit comes with the fitting and hose to easily connect to the suction fitting. On my pool, I had to remove a small screw from the side of the strainer before I could unscrew it from the pool hose fitting.The only part of this kit I am not completely satisfied with is the mounting clamp. On the plus side, this being the newer model, the clamp does fit the large oval tubing on the newer pool. On the minus side, the plastic clamp is not as rigid as I would prefer, but at this price point I do not expect significantly more. As for longevity; as I stated earlier, I had one of these installed on a previous pool and that one lasted through 4 years of my use and was still usable when I took the pool down and gave it to a friend for their backyard.",Performs Better Than A Sidewall Mounted Skimmer,Size: OSVerified Purchase,,4466846,68,14,Public

Have had a couple months now. Easy to install. A lot of the reviews are right... suction is lackluster without a good pump, even if you’re above the recommended gph, which mine was by far. I have the 2500gph from intex on my 15ft pool, which I believe is their biggest cartridge filter pump. Should be more than enough. Works better (not great still but better) if you close one of the returns (my pool has 2), but should you really have to do that? Even then, the suction wasn’t ideal. The clasps don’t always hold it in place that well, but it works for the most part. It’s nice the blue part floats with the variation in water height, as we get lots of rain here in Florida. Make sure you clean it out when it’s getting filled, especially if you did have to close one of the returns, because it stops the water flow being the only return. There have been times where it sounds like the pump is sucking air. Mine as well take it out while swimming or the smallest waves or splashing and it’ll move or come undone and everything inside comes out. Who wants to remove it every time you swim? And then put it back after? It’s not hard or anything but can be annoying. It doesn’t catch smaller things so a sock may be beneficial for that. All in all, like I said, it’s ok. I get so much better water flow without it and using BOTH returns that I don’t think it’s worth using. With that, I don’t believe it justifies the money, even if it isn’t too expensive. Circulation is key for water quality and I would much rather have good circulation using all of my available returns and just skim things out manually. I feel I’m better off without it.  Also, since it sticks out into the water and is actually bigger than I thought it would be, it catches my floater a lot, which is annoying. I actually think it would be best to get the side wall mounted skimmer. They don’t seem to be too hard to install and you can find them around the same price, as well as getting great reviews.

We have a very large pool, 18'x52' and the skimmer that came with it did not do much at all. It wasn't even in the pool. Which meant that I had to clean it DAILY, at least for an hour every time. Even still, after a couple weeks, in the mornings, we were developing this clear, bubbly looking algae on top that I felt was accumulating from lack of water flow. And the skimmer net I had was not the greatest at picking it out out of the water. Now, with this pool, it had literally been one thing after another since we bought it, so by the time we started seeing this clear algae film every morning, I was ready to burn it down. So I bought this skimmer as a last resort effort. First off, it's  ALOT bigger than I expected.

It works and functions wonderfully and is easy to clean, but it just doesn't seem that sturdy and I'm afraid the arm it mounts to will break within a couple of seasons. I suppose this isn't that big of a deal due to their affordability, but it should be built a little stronger I feel. The biggest drawback for me is the attachment hose. It just sticks on the inlet plate and is unable to rotate at all which means you have to pull it off and unscrew the plate every time you wanna vacuum, (unless you have another inlet of course, I only have the one). You have to wiggle the hose loose, then unscrew the plate every time you want to vacuum or when people swim, and reverse this process once finished, and this is a huge pain, (literally, I'm 50 and have to hang off the side of my deck and put my arm down into the pool to get to the inlet, my old knees don't like it much).So basically it works superbly when installed correctly but I think it needs a few improvements, (sturdier mounting system, rotating inlet plate for the hose for easier install/removal of skimmer).In the end the superb job it does makes it worth the extra hassle, just be aware you'll be working with it allot.

My pool has two vacuum ports, and this takes one of them...It's isn't providing much suction so, it's not the best.  However, when it is working, it's nice to have.  First, I must say I have a 9' x 18' x 52' Intex pool.  It has two suction inlets.Also, just as a top item.  I wish the assembly could better seal so the only way to suck in water was over the blue ring.  The following is a description of that failing to work correctly.In order to get this to work properly, you must restrict the flow of the other.  I have found a custom made plug,  much like the gray one contained in it (only with a few extra holes from leather punch) works best.  HOWEVER, you cannot leave your pool this way, as you will not get proper filtration and will have crap build up at the bottom.  I usually take it off restrictor either each night, or when I think about it and let the pump run normally for a while with no skimmer attached.  You could also just remove the skimmer hose, but it is a giant pain to grab again from outside the pool.It also helps to have this ""skimmer"" in the back corner.  I thought the middle would work initially but it didn't seem to work as well as the back edge.  I am afraid I might be disturbing the proper circulation though.One MAJOR problem, air in the lines as others have stated.ADDITIONALLY, periodically, the suction will no longer pull the basket down and activate the (blue) float ring to dip letting water flow over it.  So instead it basically pulls water in from under the upper lip, or from the very bottom defeating the purpose of the skimmer.  I really don't care for this design, but with some constant TLC, it will clear the leaves and bugs, etc. from your pool.  My pool is next to an oak tree on one side, and a cherry tree on the other (holy moly, lots of cleaning).  Essentially, I have to use whatever I can get to automate the surface.  I also have to frequently vacuum, but it is worse when the skimmer isn't working.  Today, I clean an nights worth of wind blow debris in about an hour (without manual skimming), but I did have to keep resetting the skimmer, and emptying the basket about every 20 minutes.This bring out another point that many have made.  A good wave or wind, maybe a large bee are all good culprits and blowing the debris in the blue ring all over the pool.  One method I use, take hand leaf skimmer (the oval looking one) and depress the blue ring while skimming the top bit of debris.  That cleans a lot of it without much manipulation.  Depending on quick/accurate I am, it usually fairs well.  For the other times, it takes a bit to catch all the stuff I just dumped back into the pool.The mounting arm is pretty flimsy, and quite annoying.  However, keep in mind it is adjustable for a purpose.  If you have the arm too high, the basket will be very close to the top ring and might create to much suction, which will eventually cause it to stop functioning.  If however, it is too low, the suction will not be strong enough to keep the blue ring below the water (ie situation described above where the water is sucked in below the blue ring), eventually causing it to fail.  It takes a balance, and a lot of attention.  I have taken to ,moving mine so it is angled forcing the front of the blue ring to always be slightly in the water (skimmer moved towards side of pool).  The at least delays the suction issue where the blue ring won't dip below the water.  Not great, but we do what we can.Skimmer socks (smaller cloth based filters that fit over the basket, inside the blue ring) will work great for a short while, but then get filled up with junk and blocks the port.  It also makes it harder for a weak pump.  I've tried them on the inside around just the basket, I've tried them around the entire assembly, which works for a bit.  Ultimately, I think I might have figured out a way to keep them working, but alas, pull them off each time.  The crap off Oak Trees can pass right through some of these wide filters, and reduce the suction on your pump.  If you have a filter style, stop and clean it.  One time mine was nearly clogged in under ten minutes (is in, I just replaced the filter with a new one, started the pump, 10 minutes later I had to pull it out and rinse it off again).  I've also had the sand one need a backwash after a short time for similar reasons.Another note as some have stated.  The blue plastic connector port for the side of the inlet WILL NOT work directly with a vacuum hose.  That was an older connector design (probably around 2014 or earlier) that allowed a vacuum hose to be inserted in to the connector.  Now that same area is covered by a plastic grate to prevent large debris.  Apparently as others have said, the only way to get the correct attachment is the cleaning kit.  I've just ordered one, so I'll review it once I have it.All in all, it's definitely a good thing to have, but it IS NOT set and forget.  Sometimes it works great for a week, sometimes I have to screw with it every 10 minutes.  Most of it has to do with the conditions it's operating in.","This is nice when it's working, but it takes a lot of work to (keep) it working.",Size: OSVerified Purchase,,2629044,13,25,Public

I was mowing the lawn the other day and heard this god awful noise. I narrow it down to the pool area.

Install is a little tricky, because, well, all Intex directions are never that great. But you knew that already.TIPS FOR EASY SET POOLS:1.  Unless your pump is anything at least 1200gph, don't bother. It's not going to provide enough suction, even when restricting the other port to increase suction in the skimmer.  Even then, I don't think it's doin much.  Even worse, you run those with a small pump,  it DOES somehow fill up and then restricts (and strains) and already weak system.  2k or more gph and this will be the best $20 you spent all summer.2. Keeping the skimmer level. A lot of Easy Set owners complain that it won't remain level because of the design or because it floats or that the inflatable ring is an issue (And yes, these work best on rigid framed pools).  The issue with Easy Set pools is that the tubing is stiff and therefore pushes up on the skimmer, lifting it out of the water.  You can try flexing the hose all you want but you need to RESHAPE THE HOSE.  Use a heat gun on low or a hair dryer to gently warm the tubing. It's cheap hose so you have to go slow,or you'll melt it fast. It doesn't take much.It needs two turns (going from the inlet to the skimmer): One immediate 90 degree right turn out of the inlet nozzle, optimally with a slight downward anfle. Then another 90 degree turn up directly under the skimmer. The rigidity of the hose will assist on keeping it level.  If you don't do this, the hose will always try to straighten, pushing the skimmer around.  No need to over tighten the clamp on the fragile inflatable ring creating a divot by summer's end.  No need to create exterior supports or tie-downs.Hope this helps someone out there!",Reshape the hose and it will make your Easy Set even easier.,Size: OSVerified Purchase,,3123211,113,96,Public

We never had any problems with our Intex except the motor on pump that came with pool just wasn’t strong enough for that size so we upgraded to larger pump for $100 & it was excellent for years. It didn’t make sense to spend $200-$300 on a new liner when we had that for so long & wanted a bigger pool anyways. So for same price as a liner we bought a new pool a Coleman & OMG what a mistake that was. thanLike the millions of others who have bought a stupid Coleman above ground pool they were faced with same problem. A pool with NO SKIMMER! Why would Coleman sell you everything you need for a pool except the skimmer? Just crazy & stupid. We didn’t notice it until after setting it up & looking for it so it was too late.It’s a huge pool so whoever is in charge of design & final say so at the Coleman pool company thought it was a good idea to sell millions of pools with everything you need EXCEPT the Skimmer should be FIRED! Thank God we found this Intex skimmer bcz it works amazingly wonderful considering it’s just an attachment. Leave it to Intex. We will never buy another above ground pool unless it is an Intex.I highly recommend this skimmer if you’re in same boat as we were. The only downfall to this skimmer is we had a hard time keeping it level so it would float to catch the leaves & stuff in pool so to make it stay down & level we just put the perfect sized rock in the bottom of skimmer & it holds it down & leveled perfectly. Skimmer fills up just like one does when it’s part of pool. If you have same problem just find the best size rock for yours & it will work fine. So glad we found this skimmer otherwise we would’ve torn this pool down this year.,Great skimmer add on for pool,Size: OSVerified Purchase,,479826,130,135,Public

I'll now be upgrading to a larger pool, but wanted to see how easy or difficult this type of pool was to keep clean before I spent more money.I believe this type of skimmer will work the best with metal framed pools rather than the air filled top rail types.Firstly, I got rid of the factory shipped sand filter and installed a larger one along with a full sized pool pump.  They were easy to find on Amazon (I'm not being paid to post this, just FYI).  The smaller factory pumps just don't have the suction needed to keep a pool clean.  I went to Ace Hardware and got some PVC pipe and fittings and fabricated intake lines to replace the original lines so my modifications would work properly with the new pump.  I would recommend that you use a larger pump than what comes with these larger pools, especially if you plan on using this type of skimmer.  That way, the extra suction will allow the skimmer to work optimally.  While I was at it, I installed another intake line to provide myself with a separate line for vacuuming the pool.  That was easy-I added valves to each intake so I can shut those off and open the vacuum line valve, which only allows the suction through that one line, which provides a greater amount of suction when vacuuming.This skimmer comes with everything needed to install.  Installation was super easy and the shipping was fast.  The only real con I can think of is that the plastic mounting  bracket will eventually lose its firmness (due to sun exposure) and make it difficult to keep in place while people are swimming (due to the splashing/waves) .  When that happens, I remove it from the pool so the basket doesn't come out of the skimmer and release the contents into the pool, or so the seal/ring doesn't sink to the bottom.  However, for the price it's really no big deal to replace every few years.  The only real alternative is to buy a side mount skimmer, but you have to cut the pool liner to install that type of skimmer.  I don't feel super comfortable about doing that and this one works just fine anyway.  I've had my pool for about 4 years and I've only replaced the original once, so not too bad overall.Again, I would recommend buying a more powerful pump and a larger sand filter than what typically comes with these types of pools.  I'm no pool guy, but if you look at the intake and return lines, it's pretty simple to go to your hardware store and buy the pipes and fittings to make your pool efficient at cleaning itself using these larger and more powerful items.  In order to keep your pool clean, though, you must have a skimmer and this one does what it's designed to do.",Surface Skimmer,Size: OSVerified Purchase,,8726869,10,8,Public

The surface of the water had so much debris from the kids getting in and out all the time.  I needed a skimmer and Amazon had what I was looking for.  The box came with everything I needed.  It had a few options for attaching the skimmer to the side of the pool, the hose and the attachments.  I was very surprised when all I had to do was remove the plastic screen from my port ""B"" (remove the screw and then unscrew the screen off the connector) and use the provided adapter and simply screw this on the connector and put it back in the port B hole.  I adjusted the skimmer a few inches below the water line and watched the floating part come up and float on the water.  I turned on the pump and nothing happened.....  Now, most of you know that the Bestway pump is a total piece of junk and I have my new pump on its way this week.  So for now, you need to plug up the second port B with the black stopper and clean out the filter from the pump.  Once you do this, and turn it on...  the amount of surface debris collected is incredible.  This thing works so well and I can see stuff just getting sucked up all the time.  I've had to stop the pump three times today and clean out the pump filter so it continues to work well.  Once I get the new pump, I will likely take out the other stopper.

We've had it in now for a week and that was the only time we have had to manually skim it. We love this thing! We were honestly thinking of not having a pool because of all the bugs we have had a problem with in the past but this has changed our minds! I honestly keep looking out our back door and I am constantly amazed at how clean our pool looks vs what it constantly looked like last year. My only worry is how it will hold up to my 4 kids this summer, I did tell them to stay away from it and to leave it alone so we shall see lol but do far so good!.... Also if you look at my pictures there is alot more in the skimmer than it shows because when I pulled it up there were alot of bugs and stuff that were under the sides of the top blue part (still inside the skimmer and as I pulled the skimmer out they went down to the bottom of the skimmer basket as the water went down)",Amazing!!!,Size: OSVerified Purchase,,1795882,28,13,Public

I shut off the pump, closed the gate valves, and disconnected the hose that goes from the bottom of the skimmer to the outlet on the inside of the pool. Remove the adapter on the outlet, and check the opening. I found a lot of hair caught on the cross bars in the outlet. I removed the hair and reconnected the hose. Next, I disconnected the inlet, or suction hose on the inlet side of the pump. I found more hair on the cross bars of the pump inlet. Cleaned those out, reconnected the inlet hose, removed the filter and hosed it out as well( FYI -  I hose out the filter after every day of heavy use with the garden hose. Been using the same filter for a month). Reinstall filter, open gate valves, purge air from filter housing, and restart pump. I recommend the pump upgrade along with the skimmer to anyone. huge difference in filtering and skimming efficiency.

I have no clue why Coleman pools doesn’t include a skimmer like this with their pools! It literally makes a night and day difference. This is an absolute MUST HAVE if you have an above ground pool.

I had bought my summer ""throw away pool"" when I saw a deal I couldn't pass up on an intex 12 x 20 ""blow-up"" pool.  I rolled the dice with little understanding of what I was getting into.  1st recommendation was ""make sure you have level ground, hire a pro""  I found the most level area of my large yard, via eyeballing it, and filled it up - turns out it was 1/4 to 1/2 off from end to end.  Acceptable.  I upgraded the filter, because how could you ignore the enormous amount of folks bitching about the included cartridge filters?  That being said, I have learned pools are a learning process and......work.  I was skimming the pool every morning and every time that the girls were getting in it (we've had it 10 days) I purchased this, and installed it 3 hours ago.  I have watched all of the gross stuff that I was skimming quickly disappear.  Here is the key (if you have the blow up sort of pool) the floating skimmer is a pretty cool design - the best skimming is if the unit is level to the water.  If you read the instruction it recommends that the basket is 1 - 5 inches below the surface.  I found that 3-5 inches is best as the float needs room to level itself.  on the blow up pools the side doesn't keep it that level so the deeper the mechanism is the more room the floating part has to level itself (I hope that makes sense) then adjust the suction tubes as to not be putting pressure on the unit that ""cocks"" it sideways.  If you try to get the unit as level as possible and then drop the basket to the max depth - it works like a charm.  My kids were complaining that I was always working rather than playing and now I feel like I have a handle on it.  I'm buying the saltwater conversion next - preparing the chemical cocktail that this thing needs is a joke (no fault of the pool - just chemistry) sounds like the saltwater is a no-brainer.  I have spent 85 in chemicals in the first 10 days.",Buy it if you have an easy-set pool (blow-up),Size: OSVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,45587101,2,3,Public

It gets in the way when kids are playing and sends a ton of extra stuff to the filter, plus it’s one more thing to clean also.  I’m not putting it on again this yeah.I have this on a 10' x 30"" metal frame intex pool.  My pump is the 1000gph intex 637R that takes type A cartridges.  The skimmer works very well and for $19 was a great purchase.  Like all the other reviews say, it gets any and all floaters off the top of the pool and I now only use my hand skimmer to stir up debris that make it to the bottom.I have 2 issues with it though. Using this will send much more debris down to the filter than would be the case if you didn't have a skimmer, and the basket openings are too large for my taste. The end result is that after 5 days running it full time, my cartridge filter was disgusting. So plan on rinsing or replacing those filters much more often if you get this.  I may go in and rig some panty hose around the bottom of the skimmer basket and see if that helps keep the ants out of the pump's filter.My other issue, and this may be in the instructions, is that I don't know the proper way to remove the filter cartridge without removing this contraption and plugging the intake hole at the wall of the pool. I suppose I can just lift the pump above the water line to keep water from gushing out, but that isn't ideal.

The pool is used mostly for the dog to jump in once she comes out of the gulf. I do this to painlessly get all of the sand and salt water off of her and she has a great time swimming in the pool vice getting a bath. But, before I got the Surface Skimmer, I had to use a net to get all of the floating debris (dog hair, bugs, blown grass, etc.) out of the pool. Today I installed the Skimmer and it started to work immediately, and within about 10 minutes, it had about 90% of the junk that floats on the water in the filter basket. It works so great, that the rinky dink pool cover I bought last year will never get put on again.The construction of the unit is your basic plastic unit made in China. The brackets used seem to be very durable and should stand up to some abuse. As my dog was thrashing around, she accidentally hit it with her paws a couple of times but did no damage. The whole unit only took about 10 minutes to install, including the higher output pump I had ordered (see below). I emptied the capture basket after a couple of hours and had caught several bugs and a lot of dog hair along with some grass. The amount of time to take out the basket, examine the contents rinse it out and reinstall took me about 2 minutes. Someone commented that the holes in the basket are bigger than they like and may put a mesh (like pantyhose) around the basket to do a better job of catching debris instead of letting it transfer to the pump filter, but I don't think I will do that as the pump filter is pretty easy to clean and the filter needs to be replaced every couple of weeks anyway. I usually prop the pump up on a table that is a little higher than the water line of the pool and take the filter out. I tip the pump over to remove any sand and junk that is in the bottom and then put the filter back in, seal the unit and set it back on the ground. That operation takes about 5 minutes.At the same time I purchased this, I also purchased a 1000 gph pump (Intex 56637EG) as the original pump that came with the pool was only 630 gph and the recommended pump minimum is 800 gph. I could kick myself though for not trying the Skimmer with the lower producing pump before I swapped it out for the higher producing pump as I think it might have worked with it.So, if you are thinking about buying the Intex Surface Skimmer and you have a pump that doesn't meet the minimum pump capacity, try it first before you buy a higher capacity pump. You might save a couple of $$s. Hope this helps.",Wow!! This is great!!,Size: OSVerified Purchase,One person found this helpful,908831,151,63,Public

It seems to be made from ""good enough"" plastics that should last for some time. As the instructions indicate, you should remove the skimmer before anyone goes for a swim since the waves in the water will dislodge the mounting arm from the side of the pool and cause air to enter your pump system and likely remove the prime.The clamps are made from plastic and I feel like it would only take slight improvements to allow it to be more permanent. I also fear that over-tightening the clamps is easy to do and will lead to eventual failure of the clamp.Outside of this, it's a great addition to any above ground pool and has SIGNIFICANTLY reduced the amount of manual cleaning I have to do by removing the waste before it sinks to the bottom.

If you use it correctly, it is very efficient. Our pool has 2 intakes, so you must use the plug that comes with it to plug off one of the intakes so that water is only drawing through the skimmer. Sometimes it is necessary to adjust the arc of the hose by twisting before it sucks at its maximum. After you adjust the height correctly upon installation, it self adjusts its height according to pool depth so you should never have to manually adjust after install. I use the skimmer and the output as a gauge of whether I am getting good flow through the filter. (Additional note: I find it best to rinse the filter out every other day for super clean debris-free water with maximum flow).  I run my filter/pump that came with the pool 24/7 (which is not according to manufacturers recommendation) otherwise debris on top of pool settles to the bottom. This reduces my vacuuming the bottom to once weekly. Also note that once a week or if I notice reduced flow, you must remove skimmer hose that attaches to pool intake, unscrew that adapter on pool wall, and clean out the debris that gets stuck in the pool intake grate.",Love this!!,Size: OSVerified Purchase,,56492257,0,2,Public

Set the level of the lower housing so the float does not lift the sealing ring. This is critical because if the sealing ring is lifted off the lower housing, debris will bypass the basket and clogs will decrease or stop system flow.3. If you are using this skimmer with a pool that has an inflatable ring around the top keep your water level at the bottom of the ring. Other wise you cannot adjust the lower house up high enough, and the sealing ring will be lifted.4.Stop the water flow before you remove the basket for emptying, or you will end up with clogs.Good luck.

I have to admit that after getting it set up correctly (not all of the instructions were correct) it works wonderfully.  A little touchy if you overfill your pool as we did.  The only thing I don't like is cleaning out the accumulated scum.  Not done right and it all goes back into the pool.  I finally realized that if I lifted the entire bottom portion (unhooking it from the pool rim), the filter pump will suck all of the scum out of the skimmer and you're left with just the stuff trapped by the basket.  Time will tell how durable it will be when exposed to daily doses of UV light.
