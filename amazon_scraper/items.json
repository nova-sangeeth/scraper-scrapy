Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement.  The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing.  This isn\u2019t anecdotal.  It\u2019s been tested and proven to be faster.",

A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say \"Hey Siri\" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.",

The Defender's holster clip would not hold the latch in the kickstand position and would click off and the phone would fall over setting on a desk every time ........And this was new, right out of the box.  Sad situation. Called Otterbox ,  no warranty since I had bought it on the internet !\n",

I hate to hold a phone when talking on it, and everyone I have spoken to on these has been disappointed with how I sound to them (sounds like I'm an in a tinny room with lots of echoes), along with my disappointment in the sound quality of those on the other end as well.\n",

I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I\u2019m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!",
