I was sorely disappointed...", "My cases in past have been the Symmetry, sleek case, which maintaining the beauty of the phone while keeping it safe from accidental drops (I have three kids, it happened more than I EVER cared to admit).", "However, they did not have the Symmetry available for my phone (well, not technically true, they only had it in the BRIGHT YELLOW, not quite my style).", "BUT, they had other Otterbox cases, so I thought... MUST be one I can find... and it's a brand I trust...", "So I found this one....", "When I received it I was slightly underwhelmed by the two different parts. Not entirely sure what the purpose of the softer rubber one was, not really knowing why it was in two parts, but, it fit on my phone, was a bit bulkier than what I was used to, but it appeared to do the job... UNTIL I did ANYTHING other than holding it like a glass egg with mittens.", "The phone dropped (again, it happens a lot with children, unfortunately), and landed flat on the front screen.", "When I saw it from afar, I was like, that sucks, but I have an AWESOME case on it, so it will be fine, right?", "WRONG!!!", "Upon picking the phone up, I notice that the ENTIRE front screen is SMASHED... I'm talking TOTAL Annihilation, not just a little sliver...", "I was confused as to how this could happen, as SURELY, the case is tested (I refer to the description of the case, found below again for ease).", "I was no longer enjoying 'non-stop texting even when my device took a tumble.'

The phone fell flat on the screen, and it was the soft rubber (where the volume control is) that bent in on the impact (unlike the hard material that ACTUALLY did the job it was meant to do).

You enjoy non-stop texting even when your device takes a tumble. (NOT AT ALL... Soft inner layer CAUSED the issue, in my humble opinion, and I def was not enjoying my texting... couldn't flipping read the screen!", "Slim design: this sleek case profile featuring a polycarbonate outer shell makes commuter Series seriously pocket-friendly. (I'll give them that, it fit in my pocket just fine... BUT I am a BIG guy, so that was never going to be an issue, I got big pockets!!!!)", "Dust protection: block out dust, dirt and pocket lint (I mean.. sure... it did that... but what case wouldn't?)", "Designed to protect: tested by US. Built for you. Otter box Certified Drop+ protection means 24+ tests over 238+ hours, which certify that this slim, low-profile case performs when it matters most (DESIGNED TO PROTECT WHAT??????
