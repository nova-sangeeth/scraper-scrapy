Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is still not enough to edit 4k60fps videos! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!", "verified": "Verified Purchase", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 30 March 2019", "votes_helpful": "25 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

It was again a great experience of speed, look, weight, logo, and u name anything u want, u have it...However, after 3 years, the problem suddenly came up. My Keypad and Mouse tracker both failed working and the reason was not known. I tried with customer care too to find a solution, however after spending an hr, I found no solution. Finally the CC suggested me to take it to Service centre. The CC person informed me that they will do resetting the mac but all in vain.

Moreover, I felt it is not so user friendly laptop and it has many restrictions. Eg-Connect Android Mobile to Mac...The cost of Display will be Rs. 49000/-..

I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:Air demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks.

I can say that this is the best budget friendly Macbook ever.I have been a windows user for a very long time and always wanted to try a Mac because the whole world uses it. I used to be an Apple critic. But after using it for months, I can say that I am never going back to Windows again.The only thing Windows does better is gaming. Buy a Windows if you care about gaming. For everything else, Mac should be your preference. If you are looking forward to developing iOS or Mac apps, Mac is the only way.It is much more faster, responsive and sturdy than my Windows laptop. The OS never crashes and the performance is just flawless. Meanwhile my Windows laptop crashes very often ( Blue screen of death, Unwanted updates, driver incompatibility etc). I receive free OS updates every now and then and there has never been a compatibility issue.Apple - You just earned a new customer for life. Just make sure you don\u2019t keep increasing the prices as it is the only con I can think of.TL;DR - If you want a laptop that is not going to irritate you every now and then and your budget is 50-60K.

After 2 years of good usage, its working same as when I bought it (processor basically). LOVE the trackpad and the keys!Things that changed after 2 years are that it starts heating up near the charging point (even when I'm not charging and simply using it) sometimes (3/10 times). I searched and found out it happens due to dirt particles going inside and can be resolved by going to a store and ask them to fix or buy a set of screwdriver for this mac and clean it up yourself.Another problem is the adapter, now after 2 years it had started heating up A LOT (7/10 times). Sometimes you can't even touch it for more than 5 seconds, it gets that hot. So for that what I do is use charger with its extension, put the adapter on the floor to transfer the heat (lol). It works most of the times for me, sometimes it doesn't and I have to take the magsafe connector off the laptop every few minutes (if I'm using the laptop) .The MagSafe connector also gets very hot while charging but cools down in literally 4-5 seconds after disconnecting.Third problem I saw is with Charging wire (from near the MagSafe connector), it's started to turn yellow due to heat probably. I put of a cable protector 2 months ago and saw this 'development' happening after that only mostly.  I took that protector off now.Overall it's a very good machine.  My friend who has the same model replaced the battery after 3+ years usage and now his laptop is working perfectly fine. He doesn't face heating problems much as I do. So maybe my laptop got some defects.I haven't tried other laptops in this range except Lenovo Yoga which was BS. I remember struggling to find internet and bluetooth connectivity in windows laptop, in Mac everything is so smooth. It doesn't hang at all! And yes not to forget, it's lightweight!!

However the recent incident with my Mac Air that I brought through Amazon last October changes the perception towards Apple took a deep dent.Few months ago I had some issue with my MacAir screen, there was no accidental fall or mishandling on my part, which is quite evident as there are no physical damage not even a scratch which says that there was any mishandling on my part.At the time it was still under warranty period, So I took it to one of the Authorized apple store nearby, At the service centre the technician just by looking at the screen told me that it won\u2019t be covered under warranty and I\u2019ve to pay  Rs. 43,000/- towards replacement, which came as a shock to me as, first there was no fault of my own, and secondly the whole thing cost me Rs. 54,000/- so I don\u2019t know how Apple justify such unfair pricing. Thereafter, shocked and helpless I follow up with Apple Support repeated calls and chatting but all in vain, but apparently I found out that there is nothing on their hand, whatever the Authorized Apple Service center says is the final. I was told it is pressure damage, which won\u2019t be covered under warranty and will cost me as much the cost of Original Machine. I was unaware and shock to find that Organization like Apple will indulge in such fraudulent and unfair trade practice for unfair monetary gain.When I look for more information online it came to my knowledge that this is not an uncommon thing with MacAir, it so fragile that MacAir is prone to pressure damage, a designing and manufacturing flaw, and there are many users who has suffered the same, and Apple has refused to address.Currently my Mac is unusable and just like that without any fault of my own my entire saving of Rs 54,000/- gone to waste. There is no question of repairing at an unjustified cost when few thousands more will get me a new one and there are better options avalible other than Mac .Pro: Atheistic, premium feelingCons: Shocking replacement cost,  Poor Post sale Support, Fragile and prone to screen damage", "verified": "Verified Purchase", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 7 February 2020", "votes_helpful": "5 people found this helpful", "image_num": 1, "num_of_comments": "0"}

It is also an investment for next 5 to 6 years for seamless laptop use. Buy only if you are going to get a good use out of it.2. The screen quality of this model( aka older version) is not the best. Newer models have a significantly better display. If you have the money, go for it.3. This is not a gaming laptop. If you are looking for that, this is not for you.Overall impression:I dont think a mac should be purchased to be a status symbol or by brand fanatics.If you are a student or someone who requires a mid range laptop, I would recommend this.For people with bigger pockets, I would recommend the new macbook air.

I bought the Mac Air (2017 version) on Jan 2019 for around 61K.Experience:About 121 GB will be available for your usage. System is super speed and responsive. Absolutely seamless performance. Display is a beauty. I know some would complain about its viewing angle, but when you start to use it, no one will care about such technical details.

I think its more than that.If you are a software developer, trust me, it will perform way more than any other i5+8GB machine, plus you get the Linux flavor.But.......1) Don't buy if you are gamer. Please don't buy. This is not meant for that.2) Don't buy if you are a big fan of windows and use too many 'unpopular' software. Although Mac OS will support all enterprise level and popular software, you will not find software for every crappy thing.3) If you are a careless user of laptop, like smashing keyboard and dropping laptop kinda guy/girl. Mac is somewhat sensitive and cannot withstand your strong emotional outbursts.4) Don't buy if you need a dedicated Graphics card or high performance systems.

Despite all the criticism I preferred Mac-book air. I would never go for Mac book Pro however.  Here are my reasons:1. Extreme portability:-Its sleek as charm and fits into my regular office bag just like slim notebook. Light weight too. Thus I carry it anywhere with ease.-Now if any coding or programming idea pops into my mind, It gets me going.2. Hardware performance:- Is simply great . I did not notice that it has an internal CPU cooler fan till, once I ran two eclipse web applications simultaneously as client and sever. A windows machine in this situation, slows down like hell, but this guy just started running its fan fast.- Sound is loud enough and incredible. Its gives a great movie experience.-Camera and display are excellent.- Battery keeps going for around 8-12 hours even if Eclipse and browsers are running. Windows laptops last only upto 4 hrs.OS performance:1. I usually hate mac OS but I have to admit, It surprised at times:- I haven't shut down this computer since the 2nd shutdown after buying it 6 months ago. Just put the lid down.- Apps are surprisingly fast and smooth, even though 27 apps are running simultaneously including heavy apps like chrome, opera  and eclipse in EE mode.I rarely give 5 stars to a product, this product deserves it.

Finally laid my hands on it yesterday when it arrived in stipulated time in the immaculate apple packing and superimposed Amazon packing in brand new mint condition.First thing that struck me- how utterly beautiful it is. Lightweight. Compact .God ! It looks more wonderful in reality than it looks in the pictures. It is a thing of beauty with a par excellence design - well spaced backlit keys. Setting it up was a breeze - took less than 10 minutes and I was ready to go. I watched a 5 minute trailer of a Hollywood film and the display quality felt divine (after years and years with my office IBM, Dell, Lenovo etc). Video was super sharp and colors straight from the rainbow.Sound quality was good too. Took some 30 minutes to figure out and get my outlook, yahoo and gmail going.Only con I have noticed so far is the lag. There is a definite time lag in opening of apps and execution of commands.I will share more after I spend some more time with it.

I was using Dell laptop before this, being a lawyer I was extensively using M.S word and excel, after purchase for about few days it was not easy to understand the pages and numbers with the hectic work which we need to handle, however as the day progressed it was ease and helpful since I had invested in the apple eco-system. But still word and excel are widely used and I need to convert before sending it to my clients. Though their is a export option but still the exported docs file are not compatible fully with widows laptop, for instance if you are using the track change option the deleted sentence/mark up does to appear in the exported docs and still there are few other issues like this. Printers we use will not be compatible with the apple software and their updates in the beginning and we need to run around to print documents till the printer release the update. But there are many advantages of MacBook which includes battery back up + you can easily carry multi task + advantage if you have invested in apple eco system + light weight + easy to move + premium look + till now I haven't seen any slow or virus issue (used for 3 months) + apps advantage + advantage of iCloud (if you are using it) + good for eyes (but I need to keep 13 inch much closure compared to my earlier 15 inch dell laptop).

Till date it is working and is very durable, even after very rough usage.Albeit, I was looking for an upgrade of RAM and processor, and I was awed by the new macbook pro 2017, with all its magic and tricks, somethings which kept me away from a impulse buy was that it lacked USB ports, Magsafe adapter, SD card slot.These 3 things were available on Macbook Air, and hence I was wavering between MBP & MBA, untill the Amazon sale happened, I was a bit late by the time I ordered the MBA, the actual deal price was at 44,999. But When I ordered it was at 49,999. I still thought it was a decent price, as comparing its $820 pricing in US market. So I am a happy customer.Now about the product:MBA is a super fast, light weight, spec wise awesome laptop, but it is structurally thin and gives a flimsy feeling that I've never felt with other apple products. Apart from that it works like a charm, you can't game on it. But can almost do everything else on it. The battery backup is a boon.If you're thinking between MBP and MBA, I would recommend go for MBP, although it is expensive and has a few setback. Mainly because of the build. And by no means does this mean, MBA is cheap or having bad quality, I mean it is structurally not as good as MBP.Pros:+ Battery+ Light weight+ Comparatively cheaper+ Its Apple, MacOS....etc, etc..Cons:- Non Retina- Flimsy- Low storage (128GB - Usable 100 GB only, it gets filled damn fast)- Comparatively lower processing power", "verified": "Verified Purchase", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 25 September 2017", "votes_helpful": "One person found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

From my personal use i did not find to be bad at all. If you are a normal user like me then the screen should not bother at all. Only those people whose work mainly depends on color accuracy can avoid it for others i feel it shouldn't be a problem. personally I am enjoying the screen.****The second point is that macbook air has only i5 fifth gen processor. But even after having a fairly old processor the machine works like a champ and it performs all the  everydya tasks in a snap. Its not at all laggy or slow because the software optimization is  superb .####### Final thoughtsFor a average user whose tasks on laptop includes web browsing, youtubing, using microsoft apps etc this  is an excellent  laptop under 55k.if you found this review helpful then please upvote it.cheers!!!", "verified": "Verified Purchase", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 18 April 2018", "votes_helpful": "23 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "2"}

This is my first mac and I have been waiting for it since the day of placing the order.Cloudtail seller:I have availed the limited time offer of around 10k amazon pay balance cash back and the whopping price around 55k. So ultimately the price came around to 45k.Pros:1. It\u2019s Apple and as all of you are aware of Apple products build quality, it\u2019s too compact and well designed with high quality aluminium body.2. SSD replaced the old shit HDD. Dude, it\u2019s damn too fast.3. Great for beginner level coding. If you plan to start pro level coding or if you\u2019re a full time coder, go for Pro. Otherwise it\u2019s perfect for the starting time.4. If you have an iPhone and your iPhone is connected to wifi, you can receive your call on mac itself. Great isn\u2019t it?5. The trackpad is more than awesome. If you haven\u2019t used a mac before, you will be mesmerized.Cons:The storage is 128 gigs. Out of 128, you can use 100 gigs only, the rest is used by the OS and preinstalled softwares.- to overcome this shortage don\u2019t upgrade to 256 or 512 gigs, you\u2019ll bankrupt yourself unless you\u2019re the owner of RBI(pun intended).

It happened to me when I was planning to buy a laptop. Before this purchase, I went through many web pages, amazon and flipkart reviews and many others. I was maintaining a wish list for long but was not able to come on any conclusion. And of course, Macbook Air was on top of my wishlist and on amazon top sellers list. But I had few concerns.Display - Recently, one of my friend bought a Lenovo 320E Laptop and I experienced its screen. That was not full HD. That experience was so bitter that I was hesitating to buy any Non FHD laptop. And almost everyone was criticizing the display quality of Macbook Air. But I got to know, only after the purchase that the display is not poor for me anyway. Display is very good while working with all apps provided you know customisation in Mac like Zooming and all. Yeah\u2026 viewing angles are not good.Feeling \u2013 When I press keyboard, move my fingers on touchpad, carry it in my office, open and close lid, touch surface, I always feel awesome. I haven\u2019t felt such with any machine; Never.Apple Support \u2013 Amazing. Serial no of my product was not correct on the invoice. So, I was facing difficulties in registering my device on Apple site for warranty and support. I lodged a request to Apple and they called at scheduled time. The conversation was so very touchy and helpful. That day I realised why Apple is dominating this sector.Sound \u2013 No complaint at all. Perhaps, some music lovers can find any.Verdict \u2013 I am not a techie, but I suggest, If you want to buy a laptop only for watching movies, pictures editing, gaming etc, don\u2019t buy it. And, if you are switching from window and don\u2019t want to WASTE time in learning of operating a new OS, in juggling with somewhat new keyboard shortcuts, DO NOT BUY it. You can become frustrated while operating an all new OS for you. You can find some compatibility issues also like non availbility of optical drive, no support for Chinese accessories and all. If you don\u2019t use cloud space for storage, you also may face difficulty with data storing as it is having only 128 GB SSD.If you can ignore above, then this is for you. Around 50K, you will not find any machine like this.

No doubt, this macbook Air stands first in this prize range (50k).First about the delivery, got this product delivered within 2 days and amazon transportation service was really very awesome. With required air bags and dual protection.About the product.Design : 9/10Aluminum body carved with perfection, sleek and very elegant look. The apple logo that glows adds cherry. Backlight keyboard is perfect for working in dark. Gesture controls in trackpad are awesome. There are about 10 geasture controls that help you work with just your fingers. The design only lacks in air ventillation. The alluminium body gets heated up when i render video edits on premier pro. For normal work, it works fine.Performance: 10/10Although its a 5th generation i5 processor, but this works far better than the 7th gen i5 processors in windows laptop. Compared intensive rendering task and this mackbook air is upto the expected mark. Thanks to the optimization, that apple always do. 8GB ram, intel HD6000 graphics is just perfect for regular work and even works fine for small scale coding and professional video editing tasks. This mackbook air boots up in around 3 seconds and sleeps in around 2sec.Battery: 10/10The best battry life i had ever experienced in any laptop. Works for around 13 hours in a single charge (continious internet surfing and online videos). Battry do gets exhausted when using professional software (adobe premier pro)(cpu intensive task).MacOS Sierra is definitely all you need. Preinstalled apps helps you to do all your school, college or office works in one place. No need to download or buy MS office. iMovies is just perfect to edit small scale videos.Storage: 9/10SSD 128 gb is superfast and really makes your work lightning fast, but you need to buy an additional external hard disk to store files and other stuffs.Magsafe2 charger is just awesome, no damage to the charging port and pin as it gets plugged in through magnetic force. No wear and tear around charging port. Also prevents accidental damage.Thunderbolt 2 post perfectly works fine with add on connector (aroung 500Rs) for HDMI streaming. 2 USB 3.0 Ports are good but it could have one one USB post.All around, This laptop is perfect for everyday use and small scale professional use", "verified": "Verified Purchase", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 1 November 2017", "votes_helpful": "14 people found this helpful", "image_num": 15, "num_of_comments": "1"}

I\u2019ve got my lesson for life...", "review_content": "To begin with I have to say I have MacBook Air 13 inch which is dead now. Why I mention a risky bet because if you\u2019re not in warranty you\u2019re gone if something happens. I bought the machine for 65,000 and now since the motherboard is gone which costs around 50,000 and no proper service centres I\u2019ve to buy a new laptop.Apple with not help at all except some trouble shooting steps calling 0009001009009 and that\u2019s it. Every time service centres will cost you around 1,700 for just opening the laptop (diagnostics drama) and make a false report so to become PREMIUM service centres in the apple service locator page.Not a bad machine though but if you\u2019re not a sort of rich guy who can afford another one at any time and instead buying this for some hope of 2/3 years lasting please reconsider this.Now I\u2019m forced to buy a windows laptop. I\u2019ve no option left as apple don\u2019t have their self stores yet in India which will be in future but none now.Anyway don\u2019t take this as I\u2019m writing because of my anger for the problem. I\u2019m just making an honest review. Anyhow to show off to the public you can buy apple MacBook with logo half eating apple is most welcome..I\u2019m attaching pics of my Mac. It\u2019s over 1 year and not a scratch yet. But service centre people will sign you a declaration that there are scratches even if there aren\u2019t any........** Apple call centre executives will talk so nicely that you will feel like the best after sales service one will get but slowly slowly you will learn. There\u2019s a saying that \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dExperiences and only experience can make a person understand nothing else\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d", "verified": "", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 23 September 2019", "votes_helpful": "7 people found this helpful", "image_num": 1, "num_of_comments": "0"}

Next shock is you cannot retrive your data because ironically SSD IS MOUNTED ON MOTHER BOARD AND HENCE WE HAVE VERY LESS CHANCE OF DATA RETRIVAL. If we had SATA hard drive which is 1/3 price of Apple.. we are assured of our back up. Never thought Apple can fool people.. i am still recovering from it.. because  Apple charges premium for their SSD. will never buy apple product ever again as i feel they not only charge premium on thier products but also the repair is Royal Premium. Now comes inconvinence part... i need to wait for a week now minimum  as the service centre is flodded with repairs. So please judge by urselves..how bad the product is. I spent around 30 minutes in their service centre but could have saved lakhs of rupees for my future as i was very much convinced by seeing the visiting customers and thier apathy...not to buy apple by paying premium price, because it is again same dam gadget...which will go bad like other gadgets..but atleast they dont charge you ransom for the last rites.", "verified": "", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 23 October 2020", "votes_helpful": "5 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

Can run windows application using wine software(personally not recommended).Recommended:Use Paragon tool for mounting your external hard drives. Can download paragon tool for free from Seagate official website.Might take time to adjust from a Window User to Mac, but you won't regret your decision.Overall MacBook Air is ideal for all kind of work except for heavy gaming.

I needed a laptop which doesn't need too much attention and is fast and sleek. I had always used windows laptops and Pcs in the past, but had heard of the macs being very fast and user friendly. Also I needed it to use Final Cut Pro which is fastest video editing tool. So I made the decision to move to mac and buy the cheapest in the lot, I had read lots of reviews and had seen unboxing and review videos, all of them complained about the poor display quality, as the lcd panel is 720p only and all of them wanted a 4K display. Still i chose to buy Mac book air, as I had in the past used 720ps laptops and display wasn't a priority to me.After having used this for past few months, I got used to the New mac OS, took me few google searches to understand it. but its damn convenient to use. Some of the impressive parts I have listed below.Battery seems to last for ever.There is no Visible air vent, and speaker vent (I was surprised how does it work and where the sound was coming from)Touch pad is so good that it feels better than a mobile's touch screen.The charger is so Small you won't believe it. (many laptops come with a bulky charger)The way power adapter connects to the Mac with magnetic strip gives a futuristic feel.The mac is so meticulously built and designed that you will love its every curve.(I don't want to romanticise about it but you could fall for it)And above all the MacOS is so good, that the jittery feel of random softwares and drivers missing in windows will not bother you here.#3 words to summarise it ALLFluid Fast & Beautiful", "verified": "Verified Purchase", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 8 July 2018", "votes_helpful": "6 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

Initially I was confused (like most of the persons) that should I buy MacBook or Windows laptop?

For this price tag you have limited number of Windows laptop of good brand and similar configuration.2. This is very sleek and aesthetically appealing laptop as compared to most of other laptops.3. Battery backup is best possible as compared to others.4. Viruses are almost nil for Mac.5. Bluetooth connectivity is easy in Mac (my own experience)6. Audio quality is best (with or without headphones) as compared to others.7. Apple logo makes it appealing \ud83d\ude09(however not related to functionality).Now here is why Windows is good1. It has more compatibility (like HDMI output, reading files etc)2. More softwares are available (cracked software works better, however we should not use them).3. Windows is comparatively easier to work with (my own perception).So finally, if your requirement is a machine which is more reliable, better battery, durable and sleek (works better in tours and journeys) go for MacBook.If you need to do experiments with laptop (like cracked games and software) and have no experience of Mac need more connectivity and free or cheaper software and hardware, go for Windows.Both are good in their own ways.", "verified": "Verified Purchase", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 27 May 2018", "votes_helpful": "75 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "1"}

So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.If you are still reading - here are the good sides (why I purchased this in spite of what I wrote above)A Mac is a Mac is a Mac. So is this one. The hardware are perfectly matched and performance is always optimal. This laptop is for carrying along as a second laptop, alongside my official one, a DELL workhorse. MAcbook Air is lightweight and can run other operating systems. I use this to run Windows and Linux.The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to \"buy\" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.Now coming back to my rating... I run mostly Windows and Linux on this MAC. Happy with it because the hardware is great. I consider myself a power user - so I know that I can find alternatives for this if and when Apple pulls the plug of support (should be available for at least another year, and a certain period after that as Apple's support to \"obsolete\" devices). Hence a durability rating of 3 stars only !!That (above) is the truth laid bare. Please decide and buy at your own risk.~~ Buy this if you like the hardware (but know that DELL or HP would give a much better hardware at this price, and those will be upgradable and last much longer than this)~~ Buy this because you understand that this hardware is very stable and Mac OS can protect your windows as it works in the MAC Shell. Buy this because you can run Linux once Mac makes this obsolete.~~ Do not buy this if you feel it adds to your premium value. It will be a dinosaur soon and you will be left stranded. Think of the plight of iPhone 5, which was premium 24 months ago. People rushed and purchased their \"cheap iPhone\" around a year back. Today, they have no pride in showing off a device that is obsolete. Tomorrow, Apple will make it sluggish and they will be forced to upgrade.EDIT/ADD [02/12/2019]: If you plan to upgrade your SSD to 500GB, please look at SSD (ASIN:B07J2WBKXF) with adapter (ASIN: B07D7VM8GM). I have been able to successfully upgrade myself.

I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU -  Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the \"Macbook\". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage.

It's true that the mac os does not natively support reading and writing on a ntfs formatted hard drive, but you can get around that by installing a nifty little software called NTFS for Mac. Its a paid software, but is a must.Once installed you can read a d write on any external harddrive which is in ntfs.The other thing you need is a software called Anddroid file transfer, which is for reading your android phones, keep in mind that with the catalina update support for utorrent is withdrawn from the apple eco system, so instead install anothe torrent client called Transmission.Now there are some compatibility issues with Pages and Word as certain fonts of Word are missing from Pages so you can identify them like 'Calibri' and install them, remember by default Pages use Helvetica Neue, so choose a font like ,'Times New Roman' and export the file you are working on as word, dont simply save them otherwise it wont open on a windows computer.There is a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube for that. Finally, the battery life is something, my macbook is over a year and a half old but still i need to charge it only every couple of days, after heavy usage.So yes, for portability its, great, very snappy to open apps like a high end mobile phone, only downside is ssd size is quite small, but i use a external harddrive for storage purposes.", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 15 October 2019", "votes_helpful": "3 people found this helpful", "image_num": 1, "num_of_comments": "0"}

Though it is pretty old, it still works just fine. And all Apple devices last much longer than other non-apple devices. Especially if you're a student, this is the perfect laptop for you. Though it might start lagging a few times, as though the hardware is new, it's not the best one. The battery is just excellent.The main reason I got this laptop was for some light editing and writing. And the keyboard is amazing (some of you might say that other laptops have much better keyboards). Editing is very easy and smooth on this laptop, as it runs most of the latest software perfectly, including a few of the graphics engines. It is perfect for studying and also works as a decent laptop for work. Though, editing long videos in 4K may cause the laptop to lag.But, the storage capacity is a big problem. You see, I edit a lot of 4K videos on this laptop, and even rendering takes up a lot of space, and I end up removing a lot of applications. So, it's better to upgrade the storage. But because of the great SSD, booting times are WAY better than my previous Windows laptop.Also, the camera is bad, but ports are great (all essential ports included, except ethernet, serial etc. and optical drive).So, if you really want to use a laptop's capability to the fullest, this may not be the one. The sole purpose of a Macintosh computer is to remove all the complications that we face with other laptops and to make a terrific computer that anyone could buy without doubting. Whenever one has to buy a computer, instead of comparing thousands of computers, they could just get a Macintosh, knowing that it won't let them down.Fixing a MacBook is even better. As you just need to take your MacBook, and a payment method, to an Apple Store, and after a few days, you'll have your laptop, running just like a new one. Everything about a MacBook is simple, thus making it the appropriate choice for students.And every Apple user will not comment on your MacBook when it'll be obsolete. Apple themselves say that every Apple product is to be used for long, then passed down to another person, and used until it becomes completely unusable, after which it is recycled to serve millions of other Apple users.So, if you want a complicated, but very powerful and customizable computer, then the Mac is not the one. But, if you want to get a reliable, simple, and sophisticated laptop that will provide you with sufficient power to do numerous tasks, without using complicated algorithms, and performing every task in a very simple way, the MacBook will be a great investment.", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 30 October 2019", "votes_helpful": "2 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

It worked absolutely fine for the first year which I sparingly used. I didnt use the laptop much in the 2nd year but surprisingly the laptop stopped turning on due to some internal problem as confirmed by their technicians. After much research and reading online, I gathered that Apple MacAir has serious issues since it's built very differently than thr the other laptops. Many parts are not repairable but are replace because of the design constraints. Basically, there is a general consensus in the buyer community that MacAir is a hit anand miss product and that the buyers should know about this before they buy. I was completely unaware of this when I bought this and no wonder Apple has stopped making these products. Interestingly enough, Apple wouldn't replace or refund or even offer me a buyback for their blunder. I was told I was one of the lucky ones since these things happen only one out of every 1000 devices they make and they said this is \"quite common\" with any other company. I was not given any option or recourse. I was told that I have the rights to pursue any legal action against them and that they were prepared for any such actions.Overall, this experience has left a bad taste about Apple as a company. I thought they were known for quality products and service and I've learnt from this experience that this is not true. I have taken a pledge to make sure that I will never buy an Apple product in my life ever again as this is the only way I can get back at them.", "verified": "", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 22 September 2018", "votes_helpful": "4 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

All the shortcomings are overpowered excellently by Mac Catalina. What an amazing OS! You will not notice any fault in this MacBook. It's a gem that never loses its value. If I talk about the Pros and Cons like many others here, it would be meaningless. Before buying that MacBook I read many reviews and watched many videos online, the cons made me utterly confused. I couldn't decide whether to buy this one or not. Finally I dared and settled my mind to go for it. Trust me, I'm not regretting at all. Battery, Performance, Screen quality and that Feel will give you no time to regret over your choice. In simple words, be in zero doubt and buy this one. Just one point, this laptop is not for the gamers as you know apple doesn't make gaming laptop at all in real words.

Excellent laptop..Just buy it..!", "review_content": "Excellent for students and business professionals.I am a mac user since 2007 and I purchased my MackBook air is 2012 and used it for four years without any issue. Compared to windows and linux laptop, this machine is very light and functional. When I say functional it means that when you press power button it just starts and is ready to use every time within minutes. It is not like windows where before every restart there would be a update for 20 minutes and every now and then failures.This machine just works every time and very light and goes for more than 7 hours non stop without charger. It has track pad much much better than any windows machine on market. You can blindly purchase this machine although the configuration may look inferior or outdated but you will not regret buying this..!I am just writing pro and con's for this machine from my experiencePro:1) Very light weight and handy2) Battery life is superb !3) No issue of virus.4) Just ok screen resolution.5) Track pad is excellent.6) Sound quality is also good7) WiFi is excellent8) Hard drive/SSD is fast..9) Media card reader built in the laptop.10) Charger is very small11) Warranty/Customer support is excellent12) Aluminium build quality is very good13) Very good battery lifeCon:1) Screen is not an HD screen but you don't need for work. (Just good enough for your regular browsing and office work.)2) Not upgradable.3) Outdated configuration when compared to current generation laptops4) Can't play heavy weight games on this machine because of ultra low power intel CPU and no extra graphics card.5) You can't run numerical simulations but you can definitely do programing/ compilation.6) Repair is extremely costly7) No CD drive although not requiredEven after so many negative points I definitely recommend this machine to my friend. Two of my friends bought on my recommendation and they are happy!

You would absolutely adore the gestures on its super-duper amazing trackpad. Install a MS-Word system and you would thank me if you buy the system after reading this review. ;)Who Should NOT:Engineers apart from specific ones (the ios devs). I bought the machine for the coding and daily RnD's and, let me tell you, to install any software is a task in its own. I am an engineer working on data science projects and love to explore any thing that comes out in tech just like every other passionate engineer, but, after 2 months, I feel like I invested my money in the wrong machine. Every day something new comes up and I find myself googling stuffs like 'install libraries FOR MAC', 'access root FOR MAC' or even, 'how to cut paste IN MAC' (believe me you would do this too!). It lacks GPU and you would feel it after running a heavy duty code. You would need to install softwares for basic stuff like connecting an android device (oh yes! feel terrible already?), connecting your hard-disks formatted in NTPC and etc etc. I can be wrong here for people working on specific tools and libraries but when it comes to generalise, I would be right. Mac is an amazing piece when it comes to basic stuff. Trackpad, the keys and the classy lightweight body are the features NOT ALL companies provide but IT LACKS BASICS for software development and RnD. I hope it saves someone's hard earned money!

There are very good options in 55-65k budget from Asus/Lenovo/Hp/Dell.What made me choose MacOS again was the ECOSYSTEM, yes that\u2019s right the whole apple ecosystem plays a significant role in deciding whether you really need this or not. I have an iPhone, iPad, apple watch and everything is so seamlessly integrated with each other that it just makes everything so easier. I can unlock my mac with my watch. Once I login with my Apple ID everything gets synchronised within my devices including my passwords etc.I have booted windows on this laptop using bootcamp and I have no issues running it.Apple products just complement each other really well. I did not had the budget to buy one of the latest model\u2019s so I decided to stick with MacOS by buying this. FYI, apple discontinued this laptop in international markets in 2018 but is still the best selling laptops here in 2020.The build quality is exceptionally well, you will not get any windows laptop built this well except for XPS (Dell) or the Surface Book (Microsoft) and they cost a fortune! Just like the latest MacBook Pro line-up.The screen is awful for content consuming, watching Netflix etc etc.See the attached image the right side of the image is completely blown out. ( image form iPhone 11 pro max believe me the screen is horrible, image is good :P )Performance is exceptionally good considering the dated 5th gen dual core chip and much much slower DDR3 1600 MHz ram. In the age of 10th gen and DDR4x ram\u2019s. but meh. It just numbers for the geeks, in real world you would not notice lag in daily tasks macOS is extremely smooth it can handle day to day task creating docs surfing web and watching movies it will give you at least 8hrs of battery life with mixed usage.This belongs to you if you are already in apple ecosystem or if you want to shift into it. Please consider this decision again because the saying \u201cOnce an apple user is always an apple user\u201d  is TRUE.If you are an average user this laptop should still last you for good 5 years.

This 2017 version of MacBook is basically an \u2018old wine in a new bottle\u2019 getting a minimal increase of 0.2 GHz in processor speed over the 2015 version. Despite having negligible changes, MacBook Air 2017 remains the best choice for the Indian masses.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Why a MacBook Air?  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Anyone trying to get their hands on this sleek beauty should definitely ask this question to themselves. Only after getting satisfactory answers, should they go forward to even \u2018think\u2019 of owning it.If you are into playing high graphics games, fancies in having terabytes of movies as a collection or gets pleasure in listening to loud music minus headphones, this device is definitely not for you to wish upon.However, if you are a frequent traveller, interested in neck-breathing performance coupled with really long battery life and is conscious of fashion etiquettes, this product is a must buy.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Positives  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::1) Sleek and Ergonomic Design  --  MacBook Air is a piece of silvery beast, ergonomically designed to appeal your senses, simultaneously making a fashion statement.2) Quite Lightweight  --  MacBook Air justifies its name, feels very light and hence much portable.3) Excellent Backup  --  Apple has definitely amazed me with the battery backup of the device which touches 11 hours on full charge. Additionally, if you leave it on sleep mode for a couple of days, it will hardly deplete even 2% each day. Don\u2019t believe me? Try it out!4) Lightning Fast Booting  --  The device boots itself in approximately 3 seconds and takes hardly 4 seconds to shut down.5) Sugarcoated with Solid State Drive  --  Since this device used Solid State Drive (SSD) as its storage medium; it is not only super fast but also extremely quiet.6) Fast MagSafe Charger  --  Well, the Air comes with MagSafe 2, a magnetic connector which attracts your charging inlet when taken near it. The charger charges the Air from 0 to 100 percent in less than 90 minutes, which is damn fast.7) Noise Less Front Camera  --  The camera it possesses is practically noise free and can impart exceptional picture even in low lighting conditions.8) Ambient Light Sensors  --  As all of you might have known, MacBook comes with keypad lightning, not to mention the backlit Apple logo. All of these are sensor enables and thus adjusts according to the lighting conditions.9) Ample Key Spacing  --  Apple packs a well designed keyboard in a 13.3 inch laptop giving ample amount of space between the keys and this is what I call an engineering marvel.10) Mac OS  --  The presence of Mac OS is solely enough to own a MacBook, taking into factor the OS\u2019s multi-level security, super stability, attractive GUI, virtually driver-less experience and its ability to recognise any Apple products. Additionally, having a personal assistant in name of Siri does not hurt anyone.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Negatives  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::1) Screen Resolution  --  Air is packed with LED backlit glossy display of resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels (HD Ready) with 128ppi. Not owning a laptop with at least a Full HD resolution in 2017 is surely a setback.2) No Dedicated Graphics  --  Nowadays, even basic games in the market requires a dedicated graphics and not having it clearly dismisses playing any game in this beastly device.3) Lower Bass  --  Although the device outputs good quality audio, there is a certain lack of bass being felt, which, in my opinion, could have been easily taken care of.After going through the pros and cons above, I am of the opinion that the decision making of yours will certainly be more definite. Also, be sure to look out for offers in Amazon as I got this device as low as 45K.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  A Kind Request  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Many of you have messaged me on Facebook asking either about the offer or about the device in details.I request anyone requiring any further help to kindly comment below this review or email me (found on my profile bio) as all your messages on facebook were in the 'Message Request' section and I did not get any notification for the same.If you are not comfortable publicly discussing, at least comment here saying 'Check your Facebook' or likewise so that I get aware of your willingness to reach me.Apologies to all who could not get my reply on time; it was unintentional.", "verified": "Verified Purchase", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 28 September 2017", "votes_helpful": "121 people found this helpful", "image_num": 14, "num_of_comments": "10"}

Just pay a look and you'll be glad you did.Let's get on with it.=====PROS=====-Excellent battery life.-Fast storage.-Great Keyboard.=====CONS=====-Dated design.-Display.-Speakers.Two years and three processor generations later, Apple is selling what is essentially the 2015 MacBook Air with ever-so-slightly closer to 2017 components inside.The 12-inch MacBook, as well as the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros were all refreshed earlier this year, complete with more up-to-date Intel Kaby Lake processors, yet notably the MacBook Air only received a minor processor clock boost. It certainly makes you wonder whether Apple cares about the MacBook Air, but nevertheless it\u2019s a fine, long-lasting laptop for general use.The MacBook Air also has the advantage of legacy ports, which Apple has sadly discarded from its modern-day lineup. Whereas the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro have gone all-in on USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3, respectively, the MacBook Air retains the \u2018regular\u2019 USB 3.0 ports and SD card slots of the past.=====DESIGN=====By and large, the MacBook Air generally looks the same as it has since 2010, and there don\u2019t appear to be any changes in tow, either. That\u2019s a shame, particularly because we\u2019re now seeing virtually bezel-less laptops with smaller footprints and high resolution screens that dismally put the MacBook Air in its place.Forget the Dell XPS 13's physics-defying InfinityEdge display, which is lightyears ahead \u2013 even Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, once seen as slightly tubby compared to the Air, has a smaller footprint and takes up slightly less space on your lap.Yet, the old \u2018if it ain't broke\u2019 mantra applies \u2013 at least to a point. The MacBook Air's aluminum unibody design, which supports the main enclosure and the display, is as durable as ever. Its lid can be easily raised with a single hand and doesn't droop in any position, and you have to press really hard to detect flex on the machine's base or lid.It's also easy to clean with a damp cloth. If there's one drawback, it's that the aluminum body can scratch easily to leave permanent black marks, so you should consider buying a sleeve if you're going to sling it into a bag for transportation.The 13-inch MacBook Air is more interesting than the 11-inch model due to housing flash storage twice as fast as its predecessor \u2013 or so Apple claims.=====SPEC SHEET=====CPU: 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz) with 3MB shared L3 cacheGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 6000RAM: 8GB 1600MHz DDR3Screen: 13.3-inch, LED-backlit glossy widescreen display (1440 x 900)Storage: 256GB PCIe-based flash storage (configurable to 512GB flash storage)Optical Drive: Not includedPorts: Two USB 3.0 ports (up to 5Gbps); Thunderbolt 2 port (up to 20Gbps); MagSafe 2 power port; SDXC card slotConnectivity: 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible; Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technologyCamera: 720p FaceTime HD cameraWeight: 1.35kgSize: 32.5 x 22.7 x 1.7 cm (W x D x H)One advantage of the MacBook Air versus the 12-inch MacBook is its wider selection of ports. On the left-hand side is a MagSafe 2 connector for power, one USB 3.0 port and a headphone jack. On the right is a Thunderbolt 2 port, another USB 3.0 port and a full-sized SDcard slot. The 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro doubles the number of Thunderbolt ports compared to the Air, and adds HDMI.macOS Sierra is the version currently shipping with Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air. It doesn\u2019t divert too much from the visual style of its predecessor, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, but it does introduce a range of new features such as Siri, Continuity between your Mac and iOS devices and Apple Pay for expediting online purchases.Sierra has since been succeeded by macOS 10.13 High Sierra, though it doesn\u2019t come with it out of the box \u2013 you have to download and install it yourself, for free. There aren\u2019t many significant improvements by way of macOS High Sierra, save for better security, VR support down the road and refinements to the Photos app.That said, given that you don\u2019t have to pay for it, macOS High Sierra is probably worth the 4.8GB hit to your data cap for the also-new Apple File System (APFS) alone. The new 64-bit file system brings native encryption and faster metadata operations to the table, making the MacBook Air quicker to use as a result.=====BUNDLED SOFTWARE=====For now, macOS Sierra ships with Apple's own iWork and iLife apps, including a modernized look for Garageband.These include:-iMovie-Garageband-Pages-Numbers-Keynote-Safari-Mail-Messages-FaceTimeIn addition to:-Calendar-Contacts-Notes-App Store-iTunes-iBooks-Maps-Photo Booth-Time Machine-Spotlight=====PERFORMANCE=====Manufactured on the 14nm fabrication process, the 13-inch MacBook Air's Broadwell CPU is a die shrink of Intel's 22nm Haswell chip. It means better battery life versus last year's MacBook Air models, although the gains aren't on the same scale as the switch from Ivy Bridge to Haswell. Still, battery life was staggering, clocking up more than 13 hours when looping a 1080p video over Wi-Fi.=====BENCHMARKS=====-Cinebench R15 Single Core: 103cb cb; Multi Core: 255 cb-Cinebench R15 OpenGL: 24.91fps-Geek bench 3 Single Core: 2,873; Multi Core: 5,768-Xbench (CPU and disk): 469.55-NovaBench (Overall): 634; Graphics: 42-Unigine Heaven 4.0 (Medium); FPS: 14.4; Overall: 438-Blackmagic Disk Speed test: Write average: 612.4 Mbps; Read average: 1302.4 Mbps-Battery, streaming 1080p video via Wi-Fi: 13 hours and 24 minutesBroadwell brings performance gains too, even if they're nothing to shout about. The MacBook Air scored 5,768 on Geekbench 3's Multi Core CPU test, representing a 9% gain over the 13-inch Air from 2014. However, it proved 20% slower than the 2.7GHz Core i5 chip in the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, which is to be expected considering that machine's faster clock speed.Apple's claim that the 2015 Air's storage is twice as fast as the 2014 version stands up. The MacBook averaged write speeds of 612.4 Mbps, and average read speeds of 1,243 Mbps, which gives the MacBook Air MacBook Pro-level storage speeds for the first time.The MacBook Pro with Retina's Iris Graphics 6100 proved 38% faster than the MacBook Air's HD Graphics 6000 in Unigine Heaven 4.0's benchmark. That said, Intel's decision to allocate die space to graphics on the CPU has been paying off for some time, and the MacBook Air is capable of playing a wide selection of games on low-medium settings with the resolution dialled down - especially when installed on a Windows partition using Boot Camp.The MacBook Air cranked out a smooth 60FPS played at 1440 x 900 with the graphics on medium, while Skyrim managed the high 50s played at the same res with the graphics on low. If your intention is to play games, you'll want to invest in a decent headset as the MacBook Air's speakers are tinny and unsatisfying. Apple managed to squeeze an impressive amount of low and mid-range tones into the 12-inch MacBook's speakers, but it's yet to use the same technology in the Air.If the MacBook Air's consistency of design can grow stale over time, this reviewer is happy for the keyboard to remain unchanged. Its slightly convex keys are the best I've used yet on a computer, and that includes the new MacBook, Lenovo's ThinkPad notebooks and Logitech's well-regarded Mac keyboards. Even the MacBook Pro with Retina's keys, which are hardly uncomfortable, feel stiff in comparison. The keyboard is also backlit and easy to clean.The MacBook Air's trackpad is just as impressive, providing a smooth gliding action that makes executing OS X's trackpad commands a breeze. It's just a shame that Apple didn't carry over the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina's Force Touch Trackpad \u2013 it's once again regular two-button clicking action for owners of Apple's slimmer machine.Apple's decision to put a 480p camera in the 12-inch MacBook was a poor one, and thankfully it hasn't followed suited with the MacBook Air. At 720p it's up to the task of Skype and Google Hangout sessions, producing sufficiently clear and defined images.=====VERDICT=====Like a pair of old trainers, Apple's 2015 MacBook Air is boring, familiar, reliable and more than up to the task. If you don't need tons of screen real-estate (or a half-decent screen for that matter), or prefer to hook your laptop up to an external monitor, it remains the most solid all-rounder out there today, whether you're desk-bound or frequently travelling.The MacBook Air's stellar battery life remains best-in-class for a 13-inch laptop, and its keyboard is the best in the business. The addition of Thunderbolt 2 will go a long way if you own compatible peripherals. Its storage speeds hold up to Apple's \"twice as fast\" claims and will prove a boon for those who regularly copy information to their Mac's storage drive.New machine, same chassis. Apple's reluctance to give the MacBook Air a Retina display is wearing thin, and it's causing buyers to look at alternatives \u2013 even defecting to Windows in some cases. Its lack of personality is compounded by poor speakers, an unsightly bezel and large footprint. Simply put, the MacBook Air just isn't that cool anymore.Much faster storage and a better performing processor/graphics combo make this year's 13-inch MacBook Air a technically better machine than its predecessor, but unless you really need those gains it's not worth the upgrade. That's particularly so in the absence of any new features \u2013 such as the Retina MacBook Pro's Force Touch Trackpad.Elsewhere, it's business as usual: while the MacBook Pro with Retina is a faster than the Air and packs more features, Apple's lighter machine is no slouch. And while the Retina model is chunkier than the Air, it's not a great deal heavier and has a smaller footprint. With both machines residing in the same price bracket, the deciding factor is more likely to be how prepared you are to put up with the MacBook Air's outdated display.If this review was helpful, please consider clicking on the helpful tab.

Got the best deal ever possible.", "review_content": "Writing this review after using it for more than a year. First thing first, I was lucky to find this product on the first day of 2017 Big billion day sale on the offer prize of 4_,000 + cashback (Will reveal the price in the end). Moving on, my previous laptop was a HP (Compaq), so undoubtedly this was a huge upgradation for me. However, i have used a lot of other laptops too. But within a single week of using Macbook, I realized what the hype was all about. Every tiny and simple thing matters a lot.1. Battery \"ROCKS\" - matters when you spend around the entire day, studying, browsing and working on it.2. Magsafe charger - is fun and highly compact and light comparatively to all other chargers3. Light weight - matters when u travel to work/school everyday with it in your backpack4. MacOS - a completely different experience (However, there are some cons to it, will mention below.)5. Multi-gesture trackpad - I have used other multigesture trackpads in other laptops. No one even comes close. This one is smooth as butter.6. Close the lid, put it in bag -> and then take it out and open the lid - Thats it! Life is so easy...However, a few points of concern especially in India.1. It is no more that affordable.2. Since MacOs is not at all common across India, so one constantly be conscious to convert the file types (MS word, Powerpoint, Ecxel etc.) before forwarding them.3. Softwares and Apps - no more best of the stuffs for free.4. Games - I guess everyone knows about this offcourse :(Overall, I hope I am never forced to go back to those fat, heavy and unconvincing laptops again. Life is easier this way.Oh Yeah!

I definitely recommend this product to others!", "review_content": "I have had my eyes on a Macbook for the longest time now but that pricing at Best Buy (no different than the Apple Store) was just too much for a 13\" & on top of that, there's the tax! I hadn't even thought about buying it online but it hit me one day to look on Amazon and I am SO glad that I did. The pricing for the exact same product here in store (and without tax!) is CHEAPER. I saved SO much money buying this Macbook here on Amazon and I do NOT regret this purchase one bit! I DID think about it a lot and read every last review and looked at all the product pictures (which were all good) and I'm glad to say that I also got a BRAND NEW PACKAGED BY APPLE MACBOOK AIR 13.3 INCH LAPTOP! It was sealed shut in the original Apple packaging brand new! Everything is running smoothly, no problems whatsoever (though I am VERY nervous of leaving a scratch or something on it so I bought a rubberized case & carrying case to keep it safe & looking new!)NOW, though the product title DOES say that it comes preinstalled with the SIERRA update. It had Sierra Version 10.12.3 and in the app store, you can update it (FOR FREE) with the May 2017 recent Sierra 10.12.5 update! IF yours comes in with EL CAPTAIN, you can update it FOR FREE to the 2017 Sierra update - do not worry! Lol.Now I don't see any big CONS to this laptop (for ME anyway) but here are my PROS:- Editing is smooth-Battery life is AMAZING. It also charges fast!- Love the simplicity off this laptop!-Everything runs smooth and is simple to access (unless you're coming from windows,etc)- The design- The back light on the keyboard & apple on back- The screen (which a lot of people complain about but there's nothing wrong with it? Pst picky people!)- Loading screens are quick- Love how it connects to my phone and i can facetime and imessage- Size is perfect- Love how slim and thin it is though I'm sometimes afraid I might drop it lol- Usb ports/sd card slot (This laptop will forever be Apples BEST laptop. Why did they take basically ALL of the ports off of the Pro's?)- Light gaming runs VERY well (for hours) with no problems or restarting & resolution is perfect (I play Sims 4)- There's enough space- Continues to get the latest updates- Magnetic charger (also love how the charger light indicates if it's charged or not)ConsI will say it can be a bit cumbersome to use the pad. I like a traditional mouse better, but this is easily resolved by attaching a wireless mouse (which I have for this computer - thank you USB port!)It doesn't have a CD drive (bummer for watching dvds/playing cds)Anyways, there's A LOT that I love about this laptop. I recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for one!

The RetailNet was the seller and their packaging and delivery were good. After using this one for almost one month I decided to write a Review of this product.Lets Talk about its Pros & Cons:Pros:1) The best battery life I ever saw on a laptop. I am a software developer and this laptop clearly gives me 8-9 hours of battery life on continuous web surfing in chrome and programming. Really impressed and I only need to charge it at morning and it last all day. The charging time was also good 1.5 hours from 20-100%.2) The beautiful Smooth Aluminum premium built quality. The laptop is very thin and lightweight. No Heating at all.3) The best track pad and gestures. The 3 finger to drag and drop was a hidden feature but it is definitely recommended to turn on. The Keyboard was also good.4) Very fast booting ie 10 seconds. The application opening time was also fast for example after boot when I click chrome it open in split seconds. Previously when I am using windows laptop with SSHD it takes at least 5 seconds to open the applications after boot. I am impressed with the performance of SSD.5) The front Camera quality is really good for video calling.Cons:1) No direct support for NTFS formatted external hard disk. The free solution is Mounty.2) The os is not as user-friendly as windows. Please note that it is my personal opinion. In Windows, we can minimize and maximize application by clicking on icons in Taskbar. The file manager is also more user-friendly in windows ie enter to open files and back key to move back etc. The cut copy and paste shortcuts also different. Remember these are not big deals and you will get used to it in a week.Final VerdictAnyway, in my opinion, it is the best laptop you can buy for this price range. The performance and battery life were awesome and the display was not bad as others say. The display was good and bright and colour production is also good but it's clarity loss on side angles. This product is shipped with Mac Os Sierra and you can easily upgrade to High Sierra. It is a 6 gb download and will take 1 hour to install. But there will not be any crashing or problems during installation.", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 15 January 2018", "votes_helpful": "3 people found this helpful", "image_num": 3, "num_of_comments": "0"}

Coming from a Windows user!(Updated 02 November 2017)", "review_content": "NOTE: If the full review is not visible, then click on the review title to open the full review in a new tab.This is to address all the doubts and misconceptions amongst the windows \u2018POWER USERS\u2019 who are skeptical about shifting to mac. Read this review once and I bet you would end up with a deep urge to own this beast.for the note - I am a computer science engineering student, making visual effects and graphic designs is my hobby and I may have used almost any power/resource hogging application you can ever think of.NOW TO THE POINT-MISCONCEPTIONS -1. Macs are overpriced.WRONG.Macs are not overpriced. You get what you pay for(bear with the uncalled analogy here) if you go and buy a Ferrari, then you pay the hefty amount for the cost of expensive parts that make up the car, and a bit for brand name. MACS ARE THE FERRARIS OF THE LAPTOP WORLD.Just pick one up in any apple store and you will agree to agree.It is not difficult to say that no company today is able to produce what apple does. They just follow up.2. Macs and windows are different/ you cannot use macs if your company uses windows.WRONG.There are softwares like crossover which run most of the famous windows software in Macs without the need to install windows separately.For those who want to install windows separately, there is a pre installed application called bootcamp, which helps you dual boot the laptop with windows and mac. So you can run both mac and windows(one at a time) and the computer will be able to utilise all the resources in running the OS used at that time. Virtual machines are also an option but they do not use full resources of the laptop.Apple is a hardware AND software company. And just the hardware is enough to mesmerise you.and here hardware refers to the RETINA screen, slim and super sturdy build, best battery life and an out of the world trackpad, whose gestures can be controlled in any way you want using a software called better touch tool. So much possibilities, sky is the limit. And trust me, unless absolutely necessary, you yourself will not want to go back to windows after using OS X.3. Macs cannot run games.First of all, you never buy a mac to play games. But if you play occasionally, then it is possible.Inbuilt iris graphics(1.5gb) are enough to play any games a casual gamer can think of(that does not mean that you can crank watchdogs at ultra), here casual means casual. Say all ps2 games. I'm rocking Tekken 5 through PCSX2 at 60 fps.4. Macs have wifi problemsWRONG.I have only experienced connection drops when my router was bad, and it was experienced in all devices I own, nothing special about macs. And there is nothing as WIFI COMPATIBILITY. wifi is wifi. any devices which can catch wifi signals can use wifi as efficiently as others. Also, it catches signals from routers far off from my house, which my nexus 7 can\u2019t catch. So another thumbs up.5. OS X user interface stuttersWRONG.Yosemite(which comes pre installed into these devices now) is still in early stages of development and Apple rolls out new updates to fix any bugs that may come in the way of the users after installing new os. Just keep your os updated and it will run silky smooth. So any stutter/lag/anomaly you may experience will be due to software which is constantly evolving, there is no hardware problem or impotent CPU. Also, if you notice lag only on some specific(and less famous) websites this is because they are not(yet) optimised for retina display and this will only get better in future as apple is shifting all of it's devices to retina display.6. Macs are less powerful for what they costWRONG.You want an example of power? My current cpu usage is 8% and 92% of it is sitting idle while I am writing this review in pages(an application like MS word for OS X, and it is pre installed, and it is better than word, and it is free) with 3 tabs open in safari and two background applications running(f.lux and better touch tool). Windows, beat that!!enough of misconceptions, now some DOUBT CLEARING FOR WINDOWS POWER USERS.DOUBTS -1. Are macs good for programming?ans- They are the best. Because mac os is based on unix, programming in them is just like/even better than programming on a linux machine. Linux is also unix based. You can write applications for OS X, IOS, Windows and android in a mac, but only for the latter two in windows.2. Are macs good for education?ans- They are the best. Because there are pre installed applications for almost all the utilities a student would need. The ones I love are ibooks,itunes U(where you can join courses, specifically for undergraduates), ilife suite, ability to use 16 different desktops at a time and sliding through them like a breeze. There is an inbuilt dictionary, when you want to look for the meaning of any word anywhere, just do a three finger tap on the word and the meaning in dictionary, in thesaurus, in wikipedia pop up in a box. There is also an application called grapher, which plots 2D and/or 3D graphs of any equation you type in the box provided. There is Magsafe 2 port which detaches itself from the laptop if a sudden force is applied on the wire, but strongly sticks there if you try to pull gently. And trust me on this, you will step on your charging wire. Magsafe comes in handy for that.3. Do macs last long?ans- If the one you received did not show any signs of manufacturing defect initially, then rest assured that they are going to last as long as the hardware becomes obsolete in the long run, only unless you are an unlucky chap with a bad logic board. Treat them well and they will serve you a very very long time. Just buy apple care in the first year and that makes the warranty from one year to three years(it does not cover battery though)TIPS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR MAC -1. Do not cover the ports and spaces made for fans and keyboard too(if possible). These are the places from where heat is dissipated and/or fresh air is drawn for cooling. And any hardware which overheats does not last long. That does not mean you cannot cover it, just do not cover the places stated above, that is, do not cover any hole you see.2. Clean the dust off the keyboard and ports of fans frequently. That does not mean after every five minutes, but at least thrice a week. It does not take long, but assures longer life for your device.(I do it everyday before going to bed LOL)3. Use a screen protector!! I know retina screens are gorgeous but they are ultimately going to get scratched(accidentally). Any and every screen protector WILL degrade the screen quality a bit. But it\u2019s something I can live with, decide for yourself.If screen protector is not your thing, then do not touch or let anybody touch or press the screen and clean it regularly.4. Silicon keyboard covers while using are a big no no. Apple exec told me this.5. Charge the laptop for short durations. Do not drain the battery all the way down to 0 from 100. This is bad for your battery. Even though Apple execs do not agree with this, but this is a general rule of thumb for Lithium Ion batteries. Batteries have to die ultimately, but you can slow down the process by treating them right.Charge in small splurges and try to keep it above 50% when possible. Do not think that using the laptop while running on ac supply with full battery will reduce your charge cycles and postpone the battery death. You are preponing it by doing so. Just like exercise is important for humans, it is for your battery too.6. Do not use google chrome, it consumes more battery(see in activity monitor)Use safari instead, it runs better.And after spending more than an hour writing this review and recollecting everything I think is helpful for new comers to the Apple family, I just want to say that take my word for it, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH A MAC. And this price is too tempting. Just pick one up and if you do not like it you can return it before 10 days of delivery are up. As they say - \u2028ONCE YOU GO MAC, YOU NEVER GO BACKUPDATE 14/03/15About the screen protector - After using screen protector for a month, I decided to remove it because it added extra glare to the screen which significantly decreased the screen quality. First it felt like a trade off between safety and clarity, but then it didn't take long to realize that with a screen protector you are not enjoying what you paid big bucks for. So rather than protecting it, enjoy it to the fullest.Also, initially, the retina display appeared to be straining my eyes a bit, but after a few weeks, the eyes adjusted to it and now it feels like reading on paper, without any strain.UPDATE 02/11/17It has been almost 2.5 years and I am very happy with my purchase. Also, all the points listed above still hold true today.

Even the screens are not revolutionary, they are not 4K yet and they do not fully support 4K and 5K video playback, my iPhone 7 and iPad Pro 10.5\" are way faster when compared to these newer Macs if you look at just the benchmarking scores, I hope this explains why I think that they are not worth their money.Now let's talk about MacBook Air, I don't understand why it gets so much bad rap,I get that the screen is not very good, but it's still very good, it's better than any other Windows laptop you could buy at this price.Configuration:It has 8 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD and has a i5 5350U processor which is an excellent configuration.Storage:Out of the box I got about 102 GB to work with, after the software update and installing Java, Android Studio, XCode, IntelliJ and some apps from Mac Store, I was left with about 90 GB, this is very very good.Performance:The performance is a breeze, I had about 20 tabs open in Chrome and Safari and still had over 5 GB RAM to work with, Android Studio and X Code run like a breeze, startup time is excellent and I was able to launch simulators on both editors in an instant and due to abundant RAM using both code editors at the same time is possible. Geekbench 4 score was about 3500 for single core and 6800 for multi core.Battery Life:Battery Life is phenomenal, I am able to consistently pull off 13-14 hours every day, I am very happy with this.Keyboard and Trackpad:Keyboard and Trackpad are in the league of their own, they are springy and very very responsive, Mac OS has these track pad shortcuts that work very well and save you time if you know where to use them.Ports:2 USB 3.0 ports, 1 Thunderbolt Display port, a headphone jack and a Mag safe charger port so yeah you won't have to carry those adapters around.Build:Very lightweight, durable and portableScreen:Not the best in the world but its very much manageable, it's noticeable if you use a retina MacBook Pro like me at office, but for me this is a non issue since I hook it up to an external monitor.Verdict:This is the best bang for buck laptop you can buy, Mac OS is the best OS out there, the hardware is the best you can buy and performance is very very good, it's not at all as bad as the reviewers write, it has an i5 processor for gods sake. In short if you want a laptop that can last for half a decade or more buy this, you won't regret.", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 12 August 2017", "votes_helpful": "132 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "6"}

September, 21 2017 2:00 AM I placed the order, the Great Indian E-comm competition benefited me immensely. Flipkart and Amazon contested aggressively during the wee ours of 21 September. Price of MacBook Air dropped from 57K to 50.. then 47 \u2026 45..44. After observing this price war for 30 to 40 mins. I made sure to order it when the price hit the lower circuit. Like people traded on Stock Exchange right after the opening bell, I was waiting for the price to drop and hit that order button. Around 2 AM I was sure 42 was the best price I could get it for. Though it could drop further, I didn\u2019t want to let go this opportunity, and finally did the transaction.Coming to the user experience, believe me this is one of the best you can get at this price. Every penny is worth. Build quality, touch pad, OS, shortcuts, brink of an eye boot up and the forever battery will mesmerise you.This machine captivates you at every instance you use it, they have put so much in designing the OS and its feature.Also, the size of the machine is a wonder in itself.", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 23 November 2017", "votes_helpful": "4 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

Some of the great features that make this Macbook Air the most unique laptop in the world.Pros.1. Lightweight. well I guess when this Macbook Air was in circulation in 2015 , there was not a single one as light as this one. Light weight makes it so easy to carry even between rooms.2. Battery backup . Could easily go for 12 hours if used like a office user ( Document processing , we browsing and minimal multimedia usage .Charging takes not more than 1 hour.3. Backlit Keyboard , Decent audio on speakers for a laptop of this size and weight , excellent audio on headphone.4.Great Trackpad ( One of the most comfortable trackpads normally found in Macbooks but not even in expensive Windows laptops )5. Boot Time - 5 to 6 secs , Same for Windows installed in Bootcamp partition.Cons.1. I would say expensive especially when it was first released it was about Rs 80000/- . I bought it for 60000/- . Now available for 45000/-.2. Screen not very good . This is more of a problem of Mac OS compatability with a non Retina Screen. I actually has installed Windows 10 with Bootcamp and Windows looked great .3. Minimal Ports . Although this is like a personal browsing machine a little more sophisticated gadget than a Ipad .That being said . I think this is a great machine for busy executives  who wants machine to be active for 14- 15 hours , Wake up time from sleep not more than 1 sec , Boot time not more than 5 secs and very easy and light weight to carry .But this is not a powerhouse not by 2017 standards. Now we have much better alternatives Like Dell XPS 13 , Asus Zenbook3 , Hp Xpectre 360  and even the 2017 models of Macbook pro - all with i7 processors , 16 GB ram , maybe sporting a separate graphics card , All the required ports , Touch screen etc.But if you already have , this is a great digital companion to have.", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 15 October 2017", "votes_helpful": "2 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

Placed order on 5th of oct 2017 got in three 3 days. Brand new with one year warranty. If you really want to buy apple, this is a good choice at just 44k.Short Story:-  Like most user if you want to have a machine for student life or office work( documentation, spreadsheets etc), or for surfing net ( fb, Instagram, wikipedia, youtube, blogs etc) or watching videos etc or coding Xcode , android thing, js crap, python, than this machine is really powerful to handle all these stuff. Plus point - if you are a traveller or don\u2019t spent most of time at one place than you have to carry only this machine, no other adapter or any other usb hub. It has great build, truly great battery life and all the essential ports (not even 2lac MacBook has this level of battery life and it entangles you in the web of adapters and adapters and adapters & hubs too)Long story:-About Myself: I am 28 years old at the time of writing. I am a windows user (and some time linux user) for the past 18 years. It was a really long time with Mr Microsoft. I am a developer (java, android, c++ and other rubbish stuff) as well as a pc gamer (Battlefield series, NFS series, GTA series, Crysis series and other great stuff).What I own right now : I have a really good win lappy. Its from Hp. 15inch, 4 core i5 processor, 8gb ram, 2gb GDDR5 nvidia card 512gb ssd, decent battery life on moderate use(around 3-4 hours as of now) cost me some 80-90k INR. It is somewhat 3 years old machine and I really love it. I am a proud owner of it. I use it for coding, net surfing, gaming , watching movies, checking emails etc. And I believe it will continue to be my partner for another 3-4 years.Why I want to buy apple :  The time has come when I want to expand my horizon in the world of coding and if I want to develop some thing for apple than the tool(laptop, desktop etc) has to be, has to be apple.Why MacBook Air 2017 model : 3 major reasons behind this:- 1. I want to have a lappy for coding Xcode etc and surfing net (mostly reading articles, youtube, fb) 2.  I want to flaunt (people really get impressed if you own an apple thing). 3. The lappy must have a glowing apple logo.(ohh That light of perfection !) 4. It has to cheap (I don\u2019t earn lots and lots of money).MacBook is a really great laptop. Read all other review to know about its greatness, solid build quality, very thin, very light, truly great battery life. The only 2017 laptop which still has a glowing apple logo( I am kind of obsessed about it).Some people complain about its display, but I didn\u2019t felt it bad. It is not fantastic but it is still good. Some made noise regarding 128gb ssd but it is still enough to keep all your personal and important things. For movies or songs collection you can but external storage device.Remember : This is not a gaming machine or for video editing and other similar works.", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 10 October 2017", "votes_helpful": "11 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "1"}

Playing games, doing programming, watching movies, downloading stuff, etc. etc... all was done in Windows. Since 2014, when I moved from business to programming skill I decided to go with the Apple Laptop, but I always stand by because of the high Apple prices.My friend has MacBook pro because he used to do editing stuff, but my purpose of buying MacBook Air is for programming only.My HP Laptop which I had bought in the year 2010 now finally sold in OLX in right price and at that amount I have purchased MacBook Air 2018 Edition \ud83d\udcbb in OCT 2017, my Diwali presents \ud83d\ude42 at a huge discounted price.To be honest, I moved from Hackintosh To Macintosh \ud83d\ude01 . I have written some PRO TIPS.========================\u2764\ufe0f Description: \u2764\ufe0fApple switched the 1.6GHz in 2017 model to 1.8GHz in 2018 model is the Broadwell processor from 2014-2015. Apple also updated the RAM from 4GB to 8GB as standard, and this is what Apple has updated on 2018 model. I got the laptop on Brand new sealed packaged by Apple MacBook Air 13.3\" with the lovely box inside which contains laptop along with power adapter, Apple stickers, and manual guides.Apple preinstalled the Sierra OS after then you should update to the latest version from the app store for free.========================\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e  PRO TIPS: \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udca1 BATTERY\ud83d\udca1 - PLEASE PAY ATTENTION HERE \u2013 This is one of the best technology I found Lithium battery. Likewise, in Windows Laptop, we required unplugging the power immediately when it reached to 100% due to overcharged it started to reduce your battery life, BUT in MacBook, due to Lithium polymer batteries, there is no need to calibrate your MacBook battery providing it is post-2009 as they come pre-calibrated. This means you do not need to drain your battery and charge it back up again. In fact, it will hurt your battery more.Second of all, plug your MacBook whenever possible. The lower the battery cycles \u2013 the better. Try not to let your battery % down to below 30%.it will do more harm than good\u2026 Long story short, just plug it in whenever you can! There is the lots of debate regarding this, but you can search more on Google.\ud83d\udca1 SCROLLING SPEED\ud83d\udca1 - Sierra does not have a smooth scrolling like in Yosemite, this is one disappointed point, to get smooth scrolling you can download the app \"Smooze Mac,\" price is also very low at Rs324 only.\ud83d\udca1 HIGH SIERRA\ud83d\udca1 - Please don't update your OS to high sierra, it is not yet stable and having some issues. Better to stay on default OS \"Sierra.\"========================\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89  Pros: \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc4d  KEYBOARD - Smooth chiclet keys with Backlit. Backlit can be control through function keys and our lovely bright Apple logo on the backside of the screen.\ud83d\udc4d  TRACKPAD - Awesome trackpad with multi-touch gestures, entirely different style than Windows laptop.\ud83d\udc4d  KEYS => Total 12 function keys including Brightness, backlit, multimedia.\ud83d\udc4d  BATTERY => Everyone saying battery life is 12 hours but only when you leave the laptop in idle mode or writing documents in the word which doesn't consume memory, I worked with 3-4 chrome tabs, programming apps which consume memory and then complete battery backup I got is 7-8 hours only. It takes just 45-60 min for fully charged.\ud83d\udc4d  SSD => The name itself said it all. I came from Windows laptop which had a normal HDD to SSD Apple laptop, and the speed is awesome, Boot takes only 5-10 seconds, unbelievable. Only 128GB data but you get 98GB because the rest of the OS and other preinstalled apps installed.\ud83d\udc4d  SCREEN - I have seen lots of HIGH TECH people complain about screen quality and pixels issue, but I haven't seen anything so far, however, if they are comparing to retina display with this one then I can't say anything more.\ud83d\udc4d  PROTECTION - It doesn't get hot or overheat, you can keep it without required cooling stand, this is what I want. Fan is entirely silent, and you can't even think this laptop has any fan inside :D\ud83d\udc4d  ADAPTER - It has a MagSafe magnetic power connector, I like the sound \"tuck\" when I connect to the laptop. The most advantage I found on this if you accidentally pull out the wire forcefully the adapter smoothly removed it from the laptop without dropping the laptop like in Windows laptop. It also comes with both 2 and 3 pin power plug, good for traveling.\ud83d\udc4d  COMPONENTS - It has two USB 3.0 ports, Thunderbolt 2, Headphone, SD card slot and dual mics support.\ud83d\udc4d  WEIGHT - It is so lightweight, and only 2kg compare to my previous 5.5kg laptop. It is so slim. I am always scared of dropping it lol...\ud83d\udc4d  ANTIVIRUS - Mac is a Unix based OS, as a UNIX-based OS macOS is sandboxed, it doesn't really get viruses, it is robust way to find the entrance of the virus until you do something very suspicious,so no expenses on Antivirus but if you are still worried you can go for free antiviruses like Avast, Malwarebytes, ClaimXav, and Sophos.\ud83d\udc4d  EDITING - I tried Photoshop and Lightroom for editing and it goes very smooth, so it will also work on After Effects and FCP.\ud83d\udc4d  PROGRAMMING - My background is computer science, so I bought this laptop for programming. I am using Android Studio, Xcode, Visual Studio, it is still a fast especially Android studio, unbelievable output, I always give A+ for editing and programming.\ud83d\udc4d  SPEAKERS \u2013 It is crispy, clear and loud.\ud83d\udc4d  CAMERA \u2013 It has a 720p FaceTime HD camera, I do not use such feature so I cannot say much about the in-depth details.\ud83d\udc4d  BLUETOOTH \u2013 It connects my Logitech K380 and Logitech M235 both Bluetooth device instantly without installing any driver. I also tried Bluetooth headphone, and it connects as well.\ud83d\udc4d  EXTERNAL \u2013 I connected AOC monitor from Thunderbolt to VGA adapter to extend the display, suitable for my job.\ud83d\udc4d  SUPPORT \u2013 It comes with one-year international warranty including online support and one year Apple protection plan.\ud83d\udc4d  GAMING - Sorry, I don't play games on Mac, I have a monster desktop to fulfill my requirement lol. I have seen most of the modern games run smoothly on MAC but to be noted. MacBook is not for gaming purpose.\ud83d\udc4d  BUY ONLINE \u2013 Showroom price is 15k more than online pricing, and they started arguing about the duplicate/counterfeit parts, but this is not true, Amazon price is very low, and you save more bucks with warranty.========================\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e  Cons: \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\udc4e  Only 128GB SSD is not enough, and I need to attach external HDD to store data.\ud83d\udc4e  No CD drive so have to use the pen drive.\ud83d\udc4e  No HDMI port, have to use Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter\ud83d\udc4e  No Internet on-off function key, have to use default OS.\ud83d\udc4e  The first word is \"i\" so every accessory for it is expensive, better is to find third-party accessories to save bucks.\ud83d\udc4e  Apple Protection Plan is along cost Rs15000-18000k for two years for MacBook Air.Have any questions regarding the MacBook Air, ask me. \ud83d\udc4d", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 14 July 2017", "votes_helpful": "15 people found this helpful", "image_num": 9, "num_of_comments": "0"}

I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the \"Macbook\". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below.

And uses the same Intel HD Graphics 6000 chip.* We get a Standard 128GB Solid State hard drive which is a good thing, and 8GB LPDDR3 RAM.* The MacBook Air\u2019s screen is a 13.3-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen display with a resolution of 1,440-x-900 pixels and a pixel density of roughly 128ppi.* Software pre-installed on the Laptop: Photos; iMovie; GarageBand; Pages; Numbers; Keynote; Siri, Safari; Mail; FaceTime; Messages; Maps; Notes; Calendar; Contacts; Reminders; Photo Booth; Preview; iTunes; iBooks; App Store; and Time Machine (backup).* And Finally the best part of MacBook Air 2017 is its battery life, is as good as the previous model or it last longer than the previous ones.If you are looking for a different OS like this one is from Apple which operating system is MacOS Sierra and moving on from Windows operating system you definitely should get this lowest price from Apple. But, if you are coming from your Old Macbook air (Previous Model) and thinking of upgrading, you should stick with your Old Macbook. Because nothing much changed from the last year model.What I really love about this laptop is, it is still the best MacBook Air for its design, price, size, and features.", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 2 August 2017", "votes_helpful": "9 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

The MacBook Air remains the least expensive MacBook, and has finally received a minor spec upgrade. Battery life is excellent, and performance for everyday tasks remains smooth. It's the only MacBook left with standard USB ports.But the design feels dated, with a thick bezel around a low-resolution screen. Windows laptops in the same price range offer newer components, higher-res screens and lighter, slimmer bodies.The MacBook Air lives to fight another day, thanks to its mainstream price and long battery life, but this classic laptop is definitely in its twilight.", "verified": "", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 13 September 2017", "votes_helpful": "3 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}

This laptop is powered by processor, coupled with 8 GB GB of RAM and has 128 GB SSD storage at this price point. As far as the graphics card is concerned this notebook has graphics card to manage the graphical functions. To keep it alive, it has a battery and weighs .In June 2017 Apple updated the processor on its 13in MacBook Air from 1.6GHz to 1.8GHz - not a massive improvement as the processor is the same generation as the MacBook Air used when it was last significantly updated in 2015 - but the MacBook Air remains a great choice for an entry-level Mac laptop.The MacBook Air is the laptop you see in coffee shops, libraries, offices, and student digs all over the world. Apple might have forgotten it in favour of the sharper-screened 13in and 15in MacBook Pro and dinkier 12in MacBook, but the masses still love the lightweight, entry-level Air.Apple isn\u2019t calling its most recent MacBook Air update a \u201cnew\u201d model, but to distinguish it from its otherwise very similar Early-2015 MacBook Air we\u2019ll call it the Mid-2017 MacBook Air.Apple hasn\u2019t changed the Air much at all since it wowed the laptop world in 2010 with its sharp, wedge-shaped case \u2013 which still looks great, in our opinion. There were some minor processor and port changes in 2015, but since then the only real updates have been upticks on the processor speed and a welcome doubling of the default memory (from 4GB to 8GB).It\u2019s still available in just the one silvery colour, unlike the 12in MacBook (Silver, Space Grey, Gold, or Rose Gold) or 13in or 15in MacBook Pro (Silver or Space Grey).MacBook Air 2017: processor, graphics and RAM2017\u2019s changes are limited to the slightly faster processor. Everything else remains the same from the most recent 2015 model, which used the same Intel \u201cBroadwell\u201d processor as the 2017 Air.MacBook Pro models have used later \u201cSkylake\u201d and most up-to-date \u201cKaby Lake\u201d processors, so if you need the fastest speeds from a Mac laptop you should look to the Pro range (from 2.3GHz to 3.6GHz chip speeds).That said, for most of us, with our browsing, streaming, social and office needs the MacBook Air should be fast enough.The 2017 model\u2019s Intel Core i5 processor gets a small speed bump from 1.6GHz to 1.8GHz. When we\u2019ve speed tested the new Air we\u2019ll let you know what that does to performance, but we can say for sure that it wouldn\u2019t be worth upgrading from the 2015 model to the 2017 Air.If your Air is older than the 2015 model - and you still love the form factor - then an upgrade might be worthwhile. You\u2019ll also get faster graphics (the 2017 Air uses the same Intel HD Graphics 6000 chip, which replaced the 2014 Air\u2019s HD Graphics 5000), and 8GB RAM as standard.When buying the new Air you can upgrade to a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor.Apple also offers a feature called Turbo Boost. In technical terms this over-clocks the processor to push to greater speeds. If enough power is available and the temperature is at a safe level Turbo Boost will 'over-clock' the core and enable it to work faster. The standard 1.8GHz i5 processor can be pushed to 2.9GHz. The custom option 2.2GHz i7 processor can reach 3.2GHz via Turbo Boost.Basically, you should go for the fastest processor if you want, and if possible Turbo Boost will push it as far as it can. But remember that if speed is really vital to you, you should look to the MacBook Pro range.MacBook Air 2017: storageThe only difference between the two MacBook Airs you can buy in 2017 is the storage capacity. In the old days we\u2019d have called this the \u201chard disk\u201d but the Air has always boasted much-faster \u201csolid-state\u201d SDD drives.The choice you get (as standard) is either 128GB or 256GB, but you can also double the maximum on-board storage to 512GB for \u00a3150 ($200).We\u2019d recommend you go for as much storage as you can afford if you plan on storing music, images or video. But if your laptop is used mainly for browsing and light document work the 128GB should suffice.MacBook Air 2017: ports and slotsThe new Air features the same side ports as the 2015 model. You get:Two USB 3 ports (up to 5Gbps) for the usual peripherals.One Thunderbolt 2 port (up to 20Gbps) for adding a larger display or faster external hard drive.MagSafe 2 power port \u2013 still the best in our opinion, and much missed on the newer 12in MacBook, which uses its single USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) port for power and peripherals, and so requires a \u00a369 ($69) Multiport Adapter if you need more than one at a time.SDXC camera card slot5mm headphone jackIf you have lots of standard USB peripherals then the Air supports these out of the box. The MacBook and MacBook Pro models require newer USB-C accessories or \u00a319 ($19) adapters.It boasts the same great 802.11ac Wi-Fi standards (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible) as the top-of-the-range MacBook Pro.MacBook Air 2017: screenThe MacBook Air\u2019s screen is a 13.3in (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen display with a resolution of 1,440-x-900 pixels and a pixel density of roughly 128ppi (pixels per inch).It\u2019s not as crisp and smooth as the Retina screen you\u2019ll find on the MacBook or Pro models. http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/what-retina-hd-display-are-they-worth-money-apple-3466732/In comparison, the 13in Retina MacBook Pro has a 2,560-x-1,600 native resolution at 227ppi.The Air\u2019s display isn\u2019t a bad screen, but Pro users might find it a little fuzzy in comparison to the Retina. The Air screen does use less power, though, and contributes to the lower overall cost.MacBook Air 2017: priceThe MacBook Air is the cheapest new Mac laptop you can buy, starting at \u00a3949/US$949 for the 128GB model. The 256GB Air is priced at \u00a31,099/$1,199 \u2013 so you pay an extra \u00a3150/$200 for the larger capacity. Add a further \u00a3150/$200 and you get 512GB of storage in the custom build option.The 8GB of RAM isn\u2019t upgradeable, but the processor is, as explained above: pay \u00a3135/$150 more for the 2.2GHz i7 processorMacBook Air 2017: installed software and appsYou get a ton of great Apple apps, including the likes of FaceTime for free video calls with other Apple devices, and the office apps (Numbers spreadsheet, Pages page layout, and Keynote presentations), plus photo archiving, movie making and music making and listening apps.Photos; iMovie; GarageBand; Pages; Numbers; Keynote; Siri, Safari; Mail; FaceTime; Messages; Maps; Notes; Calendar; Contacts; Reminders; Photo Booth; Preview; iTunes; iBooks; App Store; and Time Machine (backup).MacBook Air 2017: specs8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with 3MB shared L3 cache (Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz); with custom option of 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz).8GB of 1,600MHz LPDDR3 RAM128GB, 256GB or 512GB PCIe-based flash storage3in, 1,440-x-900-pixel displayIntel HD Graphics 600011ac Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible); Bluetooth 4.0Ports: 2 x USB 3; 1 x Thunderbolt 2; 1 x SDXC card slot; 1 x 3.5mm headphone jackStereo speakersDual microphones720p FaceTime HD cameraFull-size backlit keyboard with Ambient light sensor, and Multi-Touch trackpad54-watt-hour battery: Up to 12 hours wireless web browsing (claimed)Dimensions:Height: 0.3-1.7cm (0.11-0.68in)Width: 32.5cm (12.8in)Depth: 22.7cm (8.94in)Height: 1.35kg (2.96lb)For buying advice related to the current Apple laptop range, read our Best MacBook buying guide and Best cheap MacBook deals articles. You can also see our one-stop guide to the best place to buy any Mac.OUR VERDICTThe 13-inch MacBook Air is Apple\u2019s entry-level laptop, starting at \u00a3949 (US$999). It might lack the super-sharp Retina screen of the Macbook and MacBook Pro models but its display and performance is fine for most everyday uses. It boasts enough USB ports and other slots to make it more useful out of the box than the more limited, USB-C-only 12-inch MacBook or Pro. And its Wi-Fi is the same high standard as even the top-of-the-range MacBook Pro. If you need raw power go for the Pro. If you need the smallest Mac laptop there is, look at the 12-inch MacBook. But, all in all, despite it not changing much year after year we still love the MacBook Air for its design, price, size and features.THANKS FOR READING THIS FULL ARTICLE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION YOU CAN VISIT ON OUR CHANNEL \"TECH HARSH TALKS\" THANKS (ONCE AGAIN).", "verified": "", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date_of_review": "Reviewed in India on 16 October 2017", "votes_helpful": "3 people found this helpful", "image_num": 0, "num_of_comments": "0"}
